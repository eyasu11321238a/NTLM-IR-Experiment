Sales of the company's two other major products -- ultraviolet lamps and motion picture projection equipment -- are ahead of previous estimates, he said.  In spite of the poor performance in the first quarter, Canrad expects overall earnings and sales for 1987 to be higher than the previous year. Mr. Krieger forecasts that earnings will increase about 7% to $1.6 million, or $1.40 a share, from $1.5 million, or $1.29 a share, in 1986. Sales are expected to increase about 10% to $40 million from $36.6 million in 1986.  Mr. Krieger said that microwave equipment sales should be sharply higher in the second and third quarters. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0150': 'Award Against OKC Totaling $21.5 Million</HL> OKC Limited Partnership said a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a $21.5 million judgment against the company.  As reported last April, a federal district court in New Orleans ruled against OKC in a 1981 lawsuit filed by Aminoil USA Inc., now part of Phillips Petroleum Co. The court ruled that OKC hadn\\'t paid Aminoil its full share of profits from an offshore petroleum lease that Aminoil had farmed out to OKC. The court ordered OKC to pay Phillips the profits, plus interest, which currently total about $21.5 million.  OKC said it plans to file a motion for a rehearing in an attempt to overturn the decision, but the company said its chances of winning a rehearing are \"remote.\"  The company said it doesn\\'t expect the ruling to have a major impact on earnings because it had already set aside about $14 million in reserves to cover the judgment and reached an agreement for a bank loan to pay the balance.

The new Japans -- Taiwan and South Korea -- were thriving economically. China had shunned the Soviets and befriended Washington at small cost to Taiwan. A year ago, Washington came out of the Philippines mess smelling as sweet as that country\\'s fresh democracy.  Now, however, foreign trade strains, political turmoil in South Korea, the Philippines\\' growing pains, China\\'s turn back toward Communist orthodoxy and Moscow\\'s new diplomatic efforts in the area suddenly have created what State Department officials call \"the new East Asia challenge.\"  One problem is that economic growth in much of the region hasn\\'t been accompanied by political maturity. The U.S. challenge is to help prevent its friends\\' growing pains from becoming geopolitical nightmares. \"We\\'ve got to be prepared and look ahead,\" says Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  The U.S. must stress to leaders like South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan that long-term stability can only be ensured through democracy, not by force. It must increase its quiet diplomatic pressure on East Asian states like Taiwan and South Korea to adjust their currencies and open their markets or risk U.S. protectionism that could cause political strains.  \"We are in a transitional phase,\" says Richard Holbrooke, formerly a top State Department official and currently a managing director at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"The economies in the region have been the strongest in the world, but political stability must be maintained or their economic successes will suffer.\" He says the U.S. should focus its efforts on areas where it can have the most impact: helping South Korea create democracy and assisting the Philippines in defending it.  South Korea is approaching what the U.S. hopes will be its first peaceful transition of power in February 1988, just seven months before the Summer Olympics there. Both the government and the opposition have refused to compromise on election reform. The U.S. has thus far balked at pressing the government too hard, fearful that too quick a shift to full democracy could itself be destabilizing. But unless it does so, President Chun is likely to create a succession scenario that leaves the leadership under the military\\'s influence.  American officials believe long-term stability in the Philippines can only be ensured through more economic and military aid. \"The country needs some pump priming,\" says J. Brian Atwood, a former State Department official who is now president of the National Democratic Institute.  Mr. Holbrooke believes banks should move quickly to sort out the Philippines debt problems to open doors for more foreign investment and borrowing. Mr. Atwood believes more weapons and funds for the military also are necessary: \"If there is going to be a single source of instability, it will be the loyalty of the military.\"  Trade tensions are a growing concern. \"If we get into a broad-front trade war, it could slow everyone down and change the political climate dramatically,\" a State Department official says. U.S. protectionist moves against Asian countries could slow economic growth and breed anti-Americanism in the region.  A senior official says the U.S. needs to stress that it won\\'t accept only a marginal appreciation in the South Korean and Taiwanese currencies against the dollar at a time when the Japanese yen has appreciated quickly. Though Japanese products have become more expensive in the U.S., there hasn\\'t been a corresponding narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit because, in many cases, South Korea and Taiwan products, which don\\'t have the same price disadvantage, have taken their place.  The Communist powers in Asia also present challenges. Washington must lower its expectations of China as Beijing becomes more wary of Western ways. U.S. officials believe China could assume a more neutral position between the two superpowers, particularly if Beijing\\'s rising star, Vice Premier Li Peng, a Soviet-trained engineer who favors strong economic central planning, takes over as premier as many expect. Moscow hasn\\'t scored the huge diplomatic success it is seeking with Beijing, but U.S. officials worry about Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s proclivity for unexpected diplomatic actions.  In Mr. Gorbachev \"we are facing a creative chess master,\" says Mr. Atwood. \"He is willing to move into new areas and take risks, be creative and keep us off balance.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0121': 'Homework Gets Poor Marks</HL> TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX) </IN> Joseph Perkins\\'s defense of industrial homework (editorial page, March 6) was correct on only one point: that employers use it to lower costs so they can underprice competitors. The employer unfairly passes on his overhead for rent, machinery, repairs and electricity to the worker; piece rates invariably yield below the minimum wage in homework settings; benefits are unheard of, and even statutory benefits, such as Social Security, workers\\' compensation and unemployment compensation, are typically evaded.  The only disadvantage for the employer, apart from the illegality, is quality control, since homework makes supervision and investment in sophisticated machinery impossible. However, employers have a simple, if crude, method of quality control -- they don\\'t pay for garments that don\\'t meet standards or they send them back to be redone for no extra pay.  Knowing how advantageous homework is to the unscrupulous employer, Mr. Perkins should have known better than to fall for Norma Kamali\\'s fairy tale about the wonderful wages and conditions of her homeworkers. The Kamali homeworkers with whom ILGWU organizers have spoken at length tell a very different story.  It was Miss Kamali who asked her workers to take work home, not vice versa. Miss Kamali\\'s homeworkers were paid piece rates that yielded $2 an hour and less. They received no benefits, and were ineligible for unemployment compensation when Miss Kamali had no work. The low piece rates forced them to work long hours, and one had her children help sew.  Mr. Perkins implies that there was a positive determination that there were no violations of the minimum wage. In fact, no investigation was completed, but one is under way. Departments of labor often do not charge illegal homework employers because minimum-wage violations are nearly impossible to prove. Record-keeping is nonexistent and homeworkers are frightened to speak up, knowing that they may lose the little income they have or, in the case of undocumented workers, risk exposure to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The inability to enforce labor standards is the reason homework was banned in 1942 and 1943 in seven apparel-related industries.  Mr. Perkins asserts that sweatshop conditions are \"very rare today.\" In fact, a resurgence of the sweatshop began in major cities in the latter 1970s, fueled by highly competitive conditions in the import-battered garment industry and a vulnerable work force of recent immigrants. In the 1980s, farm distress has brought similar conditions to rural America.  Mr. Perkins accuses our union of forcing manufacturers to go overseas by \"raising the cost of doing business in this country.\" The ILGWU has fought for fair trade for many years, for precisely the same reason we fight against homework. We do not believe that American workers should be forced to compete with inhumane standards. Union garment workers earn modest wages -- about $6 an hour -- but they cannot compete with workers overseas earning 50 cents and less or with homeworkers who make $2 and pay their own overhead. America cannot be strong if \"competitiveness\" is regained on the backs of workers paid poverty wages to work long hours in sweatshop conditions.  Jay Mazur President, International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union New York --- Particularly disturbing to me was Mr. Perkins\\'s assertion that homework violations are trivial and seldom produce charges of wage underpayment. It is important to understand that record-keeping violations are not minor infractions; records are essential to ensure that homeworkers receive the legal protection to which they are entitled.  While Mr. Perkins accurately stated that a 1983 court ruling allowed the Department of Labor to rewrite its homework regulations, he neglected to point out that the court questioned government\\'s ability to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the seven apparel industries covered by the regulatory prohibition. The court identified four impediments to the effective enforcement of the minimum wage among homeworkers: difficulty in locating and identifying workers; inadequate or nonexistent record-keeping; difficulty in establishing and remedying violations, and the strain on governmental resources.  The impediments remain. After hearings last fall, our subcommittee concluded that repealing the ban on industrial homework constitutes an abdication of the department\\'s FLSA responsibilities.  Miss Kamali should be aware that this country will not allow any industry to blackmail workers with the threat of job exportation. Mr. Perkins must recognize the real threat of industrial homework -- an unprotected and exploited work force.  Austin J. Murphy (D., Pa.)

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank AG, one of the banks leading the placement, said the government's 10.1 million nominal shares will be priced at the equivalent of $136.70 each, converting the West German mark at its current rate, bringing the issue's total value to $1.38 billion. The issue is one of Germany's biggest.  The shares will be sold at a small discount to Veba's market price. Veba rose 82 cents, to $138.65, on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Friday.  The announcement late Friday contradicted rumors earlier last week that the Finance Ministry would postpone the sale because of the recent drop in German share prices.  The government announced the sale of its Veba holding in January, when it expected to receive the current equivalent of between $147.65 and $169.50 for each share. That would have valued the holding at between $1.49 billion and $1.71 billion. But German share prices subsequently entered a prolonged slump.  The center-right government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has in recent years returned several large industrial stakes to the public sector. In 1984, the Bonn government lowered its stake in Veba to the current 25.55% from 43.75%.  The government had planned to sell a 16% stake in Volkswagen AG later this year, but following news of an alleged foreign-exchange fraud that cost the auto maker as much as $259 million, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said that the sale may be put off.

       " 'WSJ870323-0097': 'Taxation is fast becoming an issue in the run-up to the Australian federal election, likely to take place before the end of 1987.  Pressure for tax reform comes from a combination of high marginal tax rates on average incomes and rapid bracket creep. Come July, the three highest rates -- 43%, 46% and 55% -- will be replaced by two rates -- 40% and 49%. But most people will carry a heavier tax burden during 1987 because inflation, now running at an annual rate of 12%, will push them into higher brackets. By the end of 1987 the proportion of income earners paying tax at a marginal rate of 40% or more will have reached almost one-half; 10 years ago it was about one-fifth.  Hardly any of the participants in the tax debate, however, are taking account of the positive revenue effects of lower tax rates. Instead, it is widely assumed that income-tax cuts must be wholly financed by some combination of higher indirect taxes and cuts in public expenditure. This assumption virtually destroyed Prime Minister Bob Hawke\\'s original tax-reform policies. His government held a \"tax summit\" in 1985 to secure consent for its plans for a broad-based consumption tax, deemed necessary to offset large cuts in income tax. The summit was a failure, since it was dominated by representatives of the many interests that stood to lose in the short term from any major shift to indirect taxation. Collectively they vetoed the consumption tax.  Trapped by its own analysis, the government made minor cuts in income-tax rates and introduced new and unpopular taxes on fringe benefits and capital gains. But having generated community interest in tax reform and having politicized so many interest groups with its summit, the government finds it has created a major issue without controlling the terms of the debate.  Recent events have served to focus the debate. First, the premier of the state of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, has announced his intention to become Australia\\'s next prime minister and to implement a 25% single-rate income tax without any increases in indirect tax. Sir Joh\\'s ambitions have received a serious setback with the failure of his candidates to win a single seat in the March Northern Territory Assembly election. But the wave of popular support he has attracted across the nation has forced opponents to take the flat-rate-tax idea seriously.  Second, Treasurer Paul Keating has ended speculation that the Labor government was planning to repudiate the outcome of the 1985 tax summit, to introduce a consumption tax and to cut income-tax rates substantially. In February he announced that no major reforms were planned; he emphasized the need for tax stability at a time of economic difficulty, noting that a consumption tax would drive the inflation rate to disastrous levels. Given the government\\'s commitment to holding expenditure at its existing level, the implication was that any revenue increases would be devoted exclusively to reducing the budget deficit. This is also the purpose of the expenditure-cutting financial statement the treasurer has since announced for May 14.  These priorities have been endorsed by a variety of Australians and organizations, from former deputy secretary to the Federal Treasury, Des Moore, to the Australian Institute for Public Policy and the Australian Chamber of Commerce. In \"Mandate to Govern,\" a recent study published by the latter two groups, the argument was that spending cuts must come first. No doubt taxes are easier to reform in times of high economic growth. But then such growth will be slower to arrive without tax cuts, and when it does, the pressure for reform will be that much lower.  Another voice raised was that of the Centre of Policy Studies (COPS), an independent policy-research institute attached to Monash University, Melbourne. In February it published \"Tax Reform -- the Next Steps,\" putting forth three options, all of which envisage a top marginal tax rate of 30%. This tax cut would be accompanied by a range of additional fiscal measures, including the removal of the existing tax-free threshold from high-income earners. The three options are as follows: abolishing the threshold and appropriately redesigning the social-security system; using the American method of recapturing the threshold by a 5% tax surcharge over a high-income range, or by a flat, broad-based consumption tax of 10%.  At the launching of the report, one of the authors noted that tax cuts should be partially self-financing through benign incentive and revenue effects. But the COPS strategy is based on the interlocking assumptions that tax cuts must be financed by expenditure cuts and that the voters will accept expenditure cuts only if they are compensated through tax cuts. The report recommends expenditure cuts of $3.42 billion ($5 billion Australian) for this particular purpose, and a further $2.05 billion to remove the current budget deficit.  But however questionable the former of these assumptions may be, the COPS report does provide a comprehensive and much-needed set of proposals for cutting the huge outlays on health, education and welfare. The structure of the Australian welfare state offers wide scope for such cuts. Although, like most Western welfare systems, it maintains the incomes of the poorest groups, it does so in a highly inefficient way. The steady accumulation of spending programs, especially those providing universal health and education services, has resulted in much tax revenue being simply churned back into the pockets of the same taxpayers. But since the middle-income groups stand to gain more in the immediate term from tax cuts than do the poor, it should in principle be possible to get them off the state welfare rolls and into private provision. This would enable governments to target public assistance to the needy.  The COPS report actually proposes spending cuts in excess of $8.9 billion. It finds $680 million from replacing free higher education with student fees of between $3,424 and $4,109 annually. Doing away with the universal Medicare scheme would save $6.8 billion, while preserving health-related benefits for the medically needy and the lower-income groups. Welfare savings of $1.37 billion could result from scrapping tax shelters for the well-off, from means-testing family allowances and from reforming the unemployment-benefit scheme. Finally, $342 million might be saved by eliminating job-creation schemes and training subsidies.  The next move is up to the opposition Liberal-National coalition, which has still not announced its tax policy. It could frustrate the government\\'s hope of fighting the election on the issue of a consumption tax by adopting one of the COPS tax-cutting options that relies entirely on existing taxes. In addition, the coalition could advance the tax debate considerably by stressing the revenue increases that could be expected from lower tax rates. In this way it could avoid having its timetable of tax reductions retarded by the inevitably slow pace of expenditure cuts.  --- Mr. James is senior lecturer in politics at La Trobe University, Melbourne, and a visiting research fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies, a Sydney-based public policy research institute.

Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.), who chairs a subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee, will introduce legislation to revamp the 8(a) program to reduce the potential for abuse. \"The goal is to preserve a worthwhile program, while addressing some obvious problems through meaningful reform,\" an aide to the congressman says. At the same time, the Senate Small Business Committee is considering holding hearings later this spring that could lead to similar legislation in that chamber.  The Wedtech case has rekindled debate about the 8(a) program, which since its inception in 1968 has been plagued periodically by allegations of abuse. The most recurrent problem has been the establishment of \"front companies\" ostensibly owned by minorities but in reality controlled by whites. In a 1979 investigation, for example, the SBA found that 20% of the 1,500 companies then participating in the program either weren\\'t minority-controlled or weren\\'t disadvantaged.  Misuse of funds has also been a problem. One company that obtained 8(a) contracts later bought a racehorse that caught a cold and died.  THOUGH THE ABUSES have been real, they have tainted the program\\'s reputation to a degree that many feel is unwarranted. \"The interest in the program is usually triggered when something negative is in the air,\" says Gordon G. Alexander, the Washington, D.C., representative of a business group, Black Corporate Presidents of New England. \"That\\'s unfortunate because these businesses are putting dollars into the economy.\"  Misunderstandings about the program also stem from the lack of any studies about its effectiveness in creating successful minority-owned businesses. Of the approximately 3,900 companies that have participated in the program, 915 have \"graduated.\" But it isn\\'t known how many of those graduates survived once they were forced to bid for work. The success rate should become clearer in the next month or so, when the staff of the Senate Small Business Committee is expected to complete a survey of 8(a) graduates.  A little over a year ago Wedtech was considered one of the program\\'s success stories. The company had grown from a small machine shop into a major maker of pontoons, engines and other equipment that provided jobs for 1,200 workers in the economically devastated South Bronx. Over the years, Wedtech got $250 million of defense contracts under the 8(a) program.  BUT LAST YEAR, state and federal prosecutors began investigating questionable company payments to politically connected law firms and consultants. A special prosecutor is still investigating lobbying on Wedtech\\'s behalf by former White House aide Lyn Nofziger. Eventually, Wedtech officials admitted bribing government officials, paying off unions, forging invoices to the government and defrauding shareholders. In December, the company sought court protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, halted operations and dismissed its workers.  Under new management, the company has since rehired about 280 workers and resumed limited production.  The legislation proposed by Rep. Mavroules is intended to eliminate the potential for many of the abuses attributed to Wedtech, while simultaneously strengthening SBA policies aimed at ensuring that young minority companies in the program ultimately can stand on their own.  On the side of preventing abuses, for example, the bill would increase fines for individuals who set up front companies to $300,000 from $50,000. It would sharply limit the number of political appointees at the SBA who make decisions about 8(a) awards. And it would bar SBA employees from owning stock in 8(a) companies.  On the business-development side, the legislation would double the length of time a company could participate in the program to 14 years. More significant, it would establish a three-phase process for weaning the company from dependence on the program.  INITIAL REACTIONS to Mr. Mavroules\\'s bill generally have been favorable. \"I think it would go a long way to preventing future Wedtechs,\" says Mr. Alexander, the representative of the black corporate presidents group. Adds Ella Mae Horse, an organizer of the National Native American Chamber of Commerce: \"I think it can only help the minority contractors.\"  The Republican response to the Mavroules bill has been more qualified. Massachusetts Rep. Silvio O. Conte, the ranking Republican on the Mavroules subcommittee, says he supports the provisions cracking down on abuse. But through an aide, he expresses reservations about doubling the participation period. The aide says Mr. Conte intends to submit a bill of his own that would make significant changes in the 8(a) program, including eliminating the role the SBA plays as a middleman between procuring agencies and contractors.  Still, Mr. Conte says through a spokesman, \"We think the time is right for 8(a) reform. We view it in one way. Mr. Mavroules views it another way. We\\'re sure we can reach a compromise.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0094': 'Forward Movement</HL> Representative spokesmen for the town of Washington were saying after the president\\'s Thursday evening news conference that it was workmanlike. Sounds a lot like the real world to us. If so, the rest of the country should welcome the president, the politicians and the press back to the daily work of making this country move in a forward direction.  There has been legitimate reason to wonder recently where we were all going. The cover of last week\\'s New Republic headlined an article by Gail Sheehy: \"Is Reagan Senile?\" This is a partisan but not entirely off-the-wall question in light of Mr. Reagan\\'s past several months -- major prostate surgery in January, the breaking of the Iranamok story, the president\\'s extraordinarily inept news conference about the affair, months of staff turmoil at the White House. It was cause to wonder.  The country learned something important Thursday evening: The fellow answering the White House press corps\\' questions isn\\'t senile. The senile-president hurdle was a large impediment to Ronald Reagan\\'s forward progress. That hurdle is now behind him. One more remains: the North-Poindexter hurdle.  Thursday someone asked Mr. Reagan if at any time he had been told about or knew about the diversion of Iran-related funds to the contras. He said: \"No. You would have heard me . . . if I had been told that at any time.\" When Messrs. North and Poindexter have immunity, they will either affirm or demolish Mr. Reagan\\'s position. If they affirm, then Iranamok\\'s political dimension, despite some residual damage, is over. The Reagan presidency will be free to move forward.  Notwithstanding the news conference\\'s great interest in the Iran affair, other subjects came up -- the budget, taxes, SDI and the ABM treaty, Nicaragua. It would be a sign of renewed community health if Washington were now able to focus its energies on the substance as well as the surface of these issues.  We have come more and more to wonder whether the townspeople of Washington would rather deal with real issues that inhere in public policy or whether they would just as soon pirouette across the political surface of public events. There seems to be something about Ronald Reagan that creates an abiding interest in whether he personally will \"stumble\" over various policy matters.  Certainly the nation\\'s interest should be larger than zero in whether the president \"stumbles.\" But the nation should also know more about Mr. Reagan\\'s Thursday night assertion that the Soviet Union had no intention in 1972 of letting its own missile-defense plans be constrained by the language or legal standing of the ABM treaty.  Similarly, the president renewed his promise to veto \"tax-rate increases.\" Tax rates in the new tax code are of course what House Speaker Jim Wright wants to raise to solve Congress\\'s struggles with budget reduction. Others in Washington don\\'t much care where new revenues come from. Below the dancing politics of the budget, however, are substantive issues many people would surely be interested in.  The current budget is essentially a zero-sum accounting game, pitting special-interest coalitions against each other for what money is available. Again, we don\\'t doubt that the degree of the president\\'s steadfastness against taxes is itself a fascinating personal story. But the larger issue Mr. Reagan is raising here is whether the federal sector has arrived at the outer limits of its responsibilities and must now redeploy those duties among itself, the states and the private sector. If Congress can\\'t let go, if it insists on some funding for all of its creations with \"new\" revenue, Washington will sink back into the swamp of special interests it\\'s lived in for 15 years.  Beyond strategic defense and the budget, there is much else of importance to occupy the productive efforts of the president and Washington. There is trade friction with Japan, international monetary policy and debt management, the question of whether the U.S. wishes to integrate its financial and securities markets into the global market or withdraw behind a wall of regulations. There is the future of the farm-crop support system and the need for clarity on the issue of whether a second communist state off the U.S.\\'s southern border matters or is irrelevant.  Getting past the Iran affair, in short, is a precondition to getting the U.S. moving forward again. The president\\'s news conference was a much-needed step in that direction. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0093': 'Today AZT, Tomorrow TPA</HL> FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) </IN> On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave formal approval to the AIDS drug called AZT. This effectively means that any doctor may prescribe AZT, subject to availability, for any patient suffering from AIDS or its related diseases. The FDA\\'s approval culminates one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of U.S. regulation of medical science.  In the new language of drug approval, AZT was \"fast tracked.\" It was shoved through a regulatory-approval system that couldn\\'t find a way to serve both the needs of the dying and the needs of bureaucracy. When AIDS became the biggest medical story of our time, the bureaucracy ran out of excuses and the federal government made sure that any drug showing real medical benefit would be sped through the regulatory apparatus. The result is Friday\\'s approval of AZT.  And now tomorrow, the Food and Drug Administration should announce its approval of tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA. TPA is a bioengineered substance that is fed intravenously into a heart-attack victim. It seeks out the victim\\'s blood clot and dissolves it, thereby renewing the critical flow of blood to the victim\\'s heart and reducing destruction of the heart\\'s tissue. In tests it has worked for many heart-attack victims. It should be approved.  In saying the FDA should approve this drug \"tomorrow\" we don\\'t mean pretty soon. We mean tomorrow, March 24, 8:30 a.m.  Two years ago this week, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that a multicenter test of heart-attack victims and TPA had been abruptly halted that February by officials at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. They stopped the test because TPA was proving nearly two times as effective at opening clotted arteries (recanalization) as streptokinase, a drug that is already approved by the FDA. In its New England Journal article, the study\\'s doctors wrote: \"Tissue-type plasminogen activator can lead to recanalization . . . without the risk, cost or delay associated\" with streptokinase.  That was two years ago. According to the American Heart Association\\'s most recent annual figures, some 1.5 million Americans will have a heart attack; more than 500,000 will die of their heart attack. What possible reason can have justified denying TPA to those among this extraordinarily large number who would have benefited from it?  Why has AZT been approved while TPA hasn\\'t been approved? AZT can have significant toxic side effects, but AIDS patients are willing to take that risk. TPA in recent studies has been associated with stroke caused by bleeding into the brain among 1% to 2% of the trial\\'s patients. Surely many heart-attack patients would willingly assume that risk, just as seriously ill people accept low percentages of risk with serious surgical procedures. And over time, physicians will learn to reduce and manage such risks. Indeed, back in October 1985 a medical panel advising Blue Shield of California said TPA should be recognized \"as acceptable medical practice.\"  Ten days ago, the FDA announced that within three months it would codify rules to speed the availability of promising experimental drugs. This important breakthrough in regulatory common sense may bring enormous benefit to this country\\'s most seriously ill people. But Friday\\'s approval of AZT shows that large needs don\\'t have to wait for new rules. With well over a thousand Americans dying daily of heart attacks, the need for TPA is large and immediate.

       " 'WSJ870323-0091': 'Cyclops Offer, Cites SEC Move --- Agency Objects to a Change In Terms; Rival Suitor Sweetens Its Tender Bid --- By J. </HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) RETAILING (RET) MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> A campaign by Dixons Group PLC to acquire Cyclops Corp. stalled as the British concern, facing a challenge from the Securities and Exchange Commission, had to reopen its tender offer for the Pittsburgh-based company.  London-based Dixons, an electrical appliance retailer, had claimed victory over a group of competing bidders after snaring 54% of Cyclops\\'s 4.3 million shares outstanding with a $384 million, or $90.25-a-share, tender offer that expired Wednesday.  But Dixons, disclosing objections from the SEC, agreed on Friday to reopen its offer until 12:01 a.m. this Wednesday. The extension enables Cyclops holders who have already tendered their shares to recall them and tender to a competing group of bidders led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer.  SEC objections revolved around Dixons\\'s last-minute decision to waive a condition that 80% of shares outstanding be tendered, Dixons said. The British concern dropped the requirement Wednesday after its tender offer attracted only a modest majority of Cyclops shares.  Officials of Cyclops, a specialty steel maker and consumer appliance and electronics retailer, and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which advised Dixons in the transaction, declined to comment. Dixons said in a prepared statement that it agreed to the extension \"in order to settle the dispute and to expedite completion of the offer, although the company does not agree with the SEC\\'s position.\"  Meanwhile, the bidding stakes for Cyclops heated up as the Audio/Video group raised its tender offer Friday to $92.50 a share. Among other things, the group conditioned its offer on receipt of the same confidential financial data Cyclops management provided Dixons.  In agreeing last month to be acquired by Dixons, Cyclops rebuffed an earlier bid of $80 a share from the Audio/Video group, which also includes Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd., a Citicorp unit.  \"It\\'s like trying to play poker with a deck of marked cards,\" Stuart Rose, Audio/Video chairman and chief executive officer, said of his group\\'s inability so far to look at Cyclops\\'s internal financial records. \"I can\\'t understand what the downside is in Cyclops\\' showing it to us,\" said Mr. Rose, adding that several Cyclops holders -- not Audio/Video -- had complained to the SEC about Dixons\\'s waiver of the 80% tender requirement.  Reopening of Dixons\\'s tender offer effectively postpones, for now, the British retailer\\'s effort to take control of Cyclops. Shortly after its tender expired Wednesday, Dixons began moving to pay tendering holders and took charge of Cyclops\\'s board, placing three Dixons executives on the board and accepting resignations from seven Cyclops directors.  Also on Friday, in a lawsuit filed by Audio/Video, a federal judge in Dayton, Ohio, denied the company\\'s request for an order forcing Cyclops to provide Audio/Video with information provided to Dixons. Judge Walter H. Rice also denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would enable Cyclops holders to recall shares previously tendered to Dixons.  Audio/Video\\'s Mr. Rose said the latter request was moot following Dixons\\' extension of its tender. Dixons, terming the lawsuit \"frivolous,\" said it will seek dismissal of the action.  Audio/Video\\'s revised bid was announced as the stock market closed on Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Cyclops shares rose $1.50, to $90.50.  The lure of Cyclops for both suitors is its Silo Inc. retailing division, which operates a nationwide chain of appliance and consumer electronics stores. Dixons plans to retain Silo and sell Cyclops\\'s steel and nonresidential construction businesses.  Separately, Halcyon Investments, a New York securities partnership, said it bought a 7.1% stake in Cyclops\\'s shares outstanding for investment purposes. In an SEC filing, the partnership said it holds 288,000 Cyclops shares, purchased Feb. 6 to March 13 for $84.189 to $93.262 each. ',\n",

The committee, in a report to Parliament, also urged the government to apply pressure to banks and other credit-card issuers to lower their \"excessive\" rates. But it said ceilings on interest rates shouldn\\'t be imposed at this time.  Canada\\'s minister of state for finance, Tom Hockin, welcomed the committee\\'s report and said the government would act soon to enact some of the measures proposed by the House Commons Finance Committee.  The committee said its proposed standard method for calculating interest on credit-card balances should allow for a grace period, the period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring interest charges. The method would allow any partial payment to be credited toward the interest-bearing balance. And it would recognize the timing of payments, so that a payment made one day late wouldn\\'t lead to financing charges for a full month.  The committee also called for wider and uniform disclosure of credit-card interest rates and other card terms to \"improve the information consumers have about pricing\" and promote competition.  Of 34 cards examined by the committee, annual interest charges in mid-March ranged from 10.25% to 28.8%. But the committee said that the numerous methods used to calculate interest and other fees makes it difficult for card holders to compare costs.  Although the committee didn\\'t recommend interest-rate ceilings be enforced immediately, Reginald Stackhouse, a Progressive Conservative committee member, said ceilings could be imposed by Parliament as \"a last resort.\"  Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn called on Canada\\'s major banks to lower immediately their Visa and MasterCard rates by three percentage points, which he said was equivalent to a drop in rates announced recently by Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada\\'s fifth largest bank.  In Toronto, a spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada, Canada\\'s largest bank, said, \"We feel our rate at the present level is competitive and acceptable.\" He said Royal Bank charges an 18.6% annual rate on its Visa credit-card holders\\' balances outstanding.

       " 'WSJ870323-0089': '--- By Harry J. Shaw</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Secretary of State Shultz is crying wolf in warning of a crisis if Congress cuts the administration\\'s proposed $20 billion foreign-affairs budget for fiscal year 1988.  While it is too early to know how Congress will react, it is clear that given its need to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target, Congress is unlikely to approve more than this year\\'s foreign-affairs budget of $17.3 billion and may cut even deeper. The current level is adequate to cover the most urgent needs, but only if Congress and the administration are willing to break loose from political constraints and allocate the limited funds to the most deserving programs.  Last year Congress lopped $4.2 billion off the administration\\'s proposed foreign-affairs budget of $21.5 billion without anything very serious happening. While there were some substantial reductions within the foreign-aid programs that constitute more than three-fourths of the foreign-affairs budget, these cuts were more severe than necessary since neither Congress nor the administration was willing to take the political heat of cutting back the $5.3 billion going to Israel and Egypt.  Congress cut the largest slice -- $2.8 billion -- from security assistance. This includes foreign military sales (FMS) loans, military assistance, economic assistance for security-related purposes, and smaller programs for foreign military training and peace-keeping operations.  The greater part of the $2.8 billion saving, however, is more illusion than reality. While on the face of it Congress cut FMS financing $1.7 billion, this reduction was taken by eliminating $1.8 billion in Treasury-rate financing. Untouched were the $3.9 billion in concessional credits offered at subsidized rates, which are usually 2.5% to 3% below the cost of money to the Treasury.  This is a shell game at the expense of the taxpayer. While the cuts look good in the short run since total outlays are reduced and the budget balance is helped, over the long run deficits will be larger because of lower receipts.  The shift to concessional financing marks a further departure from the economic criteria that should be used to establish a country\\'s need for military aid and the degree of concessionality it receives. This year and under the proposed 1988 budget, for example, Greece and Spain, countries whose economies have in the past been judged strong enough to pay the Treasury rate, will receive concessional loans.  Another worrisome trend is the increasing reliance on grant military aid. This is the most expensive form of military aid and was virtually eliminated during the Carter administration. Yet last year Congress approved $900 million in grant military aid, the highest level since the end of the Vietnam War. For fiscal 1988, the administration is requesting $1.3 billion.  This shift toward grants and concessional loans partly reflects an effort to compensate for reduced FMS financing by offering better terms. The shift also aims to avoid increasing the debt burdens some countries incurred when they took on large FMS loans financed by the Federal Financing Bank at high interest rates. As annual repayments on those loans become a serious burden for some countries, the clamor for debt relief has increased and defaults have dissipated the \"Guaranty Reserve Fund\" once maintained against such defaults.  Israel has the largest FMS debt burden ($1.1 billion in fiscal 1988) but it is essentially relieved of repayment since it receives economic-supporting assistance in the form of cash aid that is sufficient to cover its payments. Moreover, since payment of all of the $1.8 billion provided annually in new FMS financing is forgiven -- making it, in effect, a grant -- Israel is not building up any new FMS debts.  Egypt, like Israel, is not required to repay its $1.3 billion in new military aid. Only part of its $800 million in economic-supporting assistance, however, is in cash. This means that after meeting $500 million in payments on past military loans, Egypt has little U.S. economic aid left to support its economic development.  The Reagan administration has been searching for a debt-relief formula that would not trigger a general assault on the U.S. Treasury. Outright forgiveness has been rejected as too costly. The administration also rejected refinancing the $18 billion in outstanding FMS loans financed by the Federal Financing Bank because of the risk that it would open the door to refinancing the rest of the bank\\'s $150 billion in outstanding, mostly domestic, loans.  As an alternative, the administration has proposed a \"restructuring\" of outstanding high-interest FMS loans that would bring interest rates down to the current 7% to 8% range. This proposal would bring near-term relief on interest payments, but the deferred interest would be added to the principal balance and would come due at the end of the payment period in 10 to 20 years. The borrowing countries would then face massive balloon payments that many might not be able to pay.  The administration is also offering countries that can afford to do so the option of pre-paying their high-interest FMS loans. This seems more likely to help the countries least needing relief (such as South Korea, Thailand, Greece and Spain) than those whose debt burdens are the most onerous.  The prospect that some countries will take advantage of the option to pay off their outstanding high-interest loans has near-term advantages for budget estimates. The 1988 budget, for example, assumes that the administration will be able to manage the \"restructuring\" so that the positive effects of prepayments will override the negative effects of reduced interest payments, giving a positive $26 million. This is in contrast to estimated shortfalls of $770 million in 1987 and $1.7 billion in 1989. Such are the government\\'s ingenious schemes for manipulating deficit estimates.  Of the administration\\'s proposed $20 billion foreign-affairs budget for 1988, $15 billion would go to foreign aid. Of that $15 billion, 38% is for development aid, up from the administration\\'s request of 33% last year. This is due largely to a $435 million increase for multilateral development banks. (Bilateral development aid remains essentially unchanged at $3.3 billion.)  While this shift in favor of development aid appears to reflect a departure from the administration\\'s past emphasis on security-related aid, it is probably more a response to Congress\\'s tendency to cut security assistance more severely. Moreover, while the administration is requesting $1.4 billion less in security aid than last year, the saving is offset by greater concessionality. Outright grants increase from 75% to 85% and all FMS financing is at concessional interest rates.  Under Democratic leadership, Congress is not likely to favor an increase in security aid at the expense of bilateral development aid. The greatest cuts are likely to be made in security assistance and a proposed substantial increase for multilateral development banks -- a proposal that Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, said earlier this month \"doesn\\'t stand a chance of a snowball in hell.\"  Although it is unlikely to increase military grants by nearly 50%, as proposed by the administration, Congress might be tempted to go along with some increase in grants as well as greater concessionality in FMS loans, especially if the outlay effects can be masked by prepayments of past FMS loans.  But greater concessionality is a move in the direction of higher costs and prolonged dependency -- exactly the wrong direction for our security-assistance program. Instead, Congress should hold the line by rejecting any increase in security assistance, especially in grants, and by requiring that concessional FMS financing be offered only where economic criteria justify it.  Lacking any broad consensus on the purposes of foreign aid and unwilling to take on domestic supporters of key recipients such as Israel, Egypt and Greece, Congress is unlikely to give the administration much leeway in allocating the available funds. If, as seems all too likely, Congress cuts foreign aid again while maintaining current earmarks, it will further distort a program in which aid to Israel and Egypt equals U.S. bilateral and multilateral aid to the rest of the world.  But this is to be expected of a foreign-aid program that lacks a coherent rationale and is largely devoted to satisfying the efforts of special interests to protect the aid levels of a few favored countries. While congressional pressures on overall aid levels, coming largely from the budget and appropriations committees, have forced some overdue cuts, few knowledgeable persons in either the administration or Congress would argue that the resulting program represents a sound allocation of the limited resources available. Little is likely to be done about this in the dying years of the Reagan administration. But it is not too soon for Congress to initiate a comprehensive, critical reappraisal of foreign aid.  --- Mr. Shaw, who teaches international law at George Washington University, was chief of the military-assistance branch of the Office of Management and Budget from 1967 to 1980.

       " 'WSJ870323-0088': 'Hong Kong Stocks Are Volatile of Late, But Boost From Local Economy Is Seen --- By Marcus W. Brauchli Special to The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN> The British colony\\'s stock market has displayed sharp volatility recently, after an easy climb to new heights earlier in the year.  In the first half of March, the Hang Seng index, which tracks 33 major stocks, plummeted more than 11% from the record 2939.05 registered March 3. The string of losses ended abruptly Wednesday, though, when the indicator rebounded nearly 95 points, or about 3.5%, in a single session. The index edged lower again Thursday but surged 59.27 points Friday to close the week at 2780.55.  Although earnings-related trading and overseas investors alike have played a role in the recent turbulence, essentially it is a transient, technical reaction to a February rally that saw the Hang Seng index climb nearly 15%, Hong Kong securities analysts say. Brokers as well as analysts expect stocks to settle into a steady upward trend again soon, backed by strong economic and financial fundamentals.  \"When the dust finally settles, we expect this market to pick up considerably,\" says David Harman, an equities manager at Berisford Cresvale (Far East) Ltd., a British securities firm. Following February\\'s solid performance, Mr. Harman says, \"a normal correction of some size could have been expected and, in fact, was overdue.\"  The correction was exacerbated by its timing, coming just as major companies were reporting last year\\'s results. \"People usually sell into results\" in Hong Kong, Mr. Harman says.  Earnings for major companies listed on the colony\\'s stock exchange so far are up at least 30% on average, in line with local expectations. But news that several big groups were planning reorganizations and rights issues spurred profit-taking.  Among the companies seeking to raise money through such issues are Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., Jardine Matheson Strategic Holdings Ltd., Hongkong Land Co. and New World Hotels Ltd. The total cost of those proposed issues to shareholders will be about the equivalent of $897.3 million.  Rights issues contributed to the market\\'s recent slump by forcing local investors to skim profits from their portfolios to finance their portions of the issues, says Stuart Cook, a director of research at the Hong Kong office of James Capel &amp; Co., a British securities firm owned by Hongkong Bank. \"Very soon now, the issues should be well and truly discounted in the market,\" Mr. Cook says.  Local investors, who have been pushing the market lower, often are quicker to adjust their positions than foreign investors, he says. Many of market\\'s foreign participants started investing only in the past several years -- and since August in particular, when Tokyo\\'s stock market faltered. So they aren\\'t accustomed to the rapid pace of share turnover practiced by many local institutions.  \"This is one of the world\\'s busiest markets,\" a broker says, noting that the average daily turnover has increased about sevenfold from a year ago. If Hong Kong\\'s average daily turnover of $182 million persists, in a year the equivalent of nearly three-quarters of the exchange\\'s total capitalization of around $60.24 billion will change hands.  Still, even though locals generally trade their portfolios more frequently, much of that liquidity derives from the recent foreign investment. And because foreign institutions have been buying heavily, most were unwilling to take on additional shares to prop up the market when local selling knocked it lower this month. Nor would the foreign houses sell -- and take losses -- at the market\\'s lower levels, so volume has declined even as the market\\'s volatility has increased.  The market should emerge from its current volatility soon and head higher, analysts say, noting that the economic fundamentals backing the market are among the strongest in Asia.  \"Hong Kong is the only market in Asia with rapidly improving fundamentals,\" says John C. Quinn, a director of Chase Manhattan Trust Co.\\'s Hong Kong office. \"We don\\'t see any big downside risk here.\"  A chief factor supporting the market is Hong Kong\\'s strong, export-driven economy, which should grow at least 6% this year, after swelling around 9% last year, the colony\\'s government says. The stability of the local currency, which is officially linked to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to one, and relatively low interest rates, which have bolstered local property prices considerably in the past year, are chief factors as well.  \"Fundamentally, Hong Kong is one of the strongest markets in the world,\" says Caspar Li, an assistant director of research at Vickers da Costa &amp; Co., a brokerage owned by Citicorp.

       " 'WSJ870323-0087': 'Visa\\'s Outspoken President Leads Charge Against American Express --- By Richard B. Schmitt Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> Charles T. Russell used to play trombone in Pittsburgh burlesque houses and with big bands in the Southeast. He gave it up for banking, but he still knows how to attract a crowd.  Mr. Russell, the president of Visa International, a bank-owned credit-card association, recently urged members to consider halting sales of American Express Co. services in retaliation for the financial-service giant\\'s recent decision to begin offering a new cut-rate credit card.  Consumer groups denounced the plea as an illegal restraint of trade, and Congress is considering an inquiry. But Mr. Russell is resolute. \"Banks need to realize that there is a fox in the henhouse,\" he declares. Visa and the 56-year-old Mr. Russell, who enjoys riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, have collided with consumers and Congress before. Critics have long alleged that Visa member banks and other card issuers inflate interest rates. As in past years, Congress is currently considering imposing rate ceilings, and some consumer groups think such a law would be an appropriate response to Mr. Russell\\'s recent harangue.  But the push in Congress has fallen short in the past, with Mr. Russell\\'s plain talk helping to lead the opposition. \"He is more vociferous, but his statements probably reflect the general thought of the leading card issuers,\" says Pete Hart, a First Interstate Bancorp executive vice president.  Forewarned, First Interstate, which offers American Express Gold cards and travelers checks, is \"reevaluating our relationship\" with American Express, according to Mr. Hart. Nothing rash is planned, he says, but the new card -- Optima -- is \"without question an intrusion into our business.\"  American Express and the banks are used to being allies rather than adversaries. American Express cards generally don\\'t offer revolving credit, and banks have marketed them alongside their Visa and MasterCard cards, which do.  But Optima will compete head-on. The card will cost $15 a year, in addition to the $45 that American Express charges for its regular card. But it will extend 13.5% credit. The average Visa card also carries a $15 annual fee, but it has a stiffer 17.5% rate, and several big banks charge even more.  American Express says only a limited number of existing customers will be offered the new card. It doesn\\'t expect to issue many more than two million of them by 1990, compared with about 100 million current Visa card holders. It doesn\\'t know what the fuss is all about.  \"We are not basically in the credit business,\" says an American Express spokesman. \"We\\'re going after a select market.\"  But the elite group that American Express is targeting has been a major source of bank credit card earnings. Banks also believe that the American Express estimates are too modest, and some fear a plastic rate war.  \"They aren\\'t going to fail,\" says Mr. Russell. \"I don\\'t admire their ethics, but I certainly respect their knowledge.\" He thinks American Express is misleading consumers, arguing that the Optima rate is closer to 18% when the tie-in with the regular card is considered.  The flap comes at a time when Visa and its members have few other reasons to complain. There are 22% more Visa card holders world-wide than there were two years ago. The group, which furnishes members with new products, system support and other services, is developing computerized cards and new links with automated teller machines. For the banks, credit cards have been a growing source of profits, although tax changes and a growing consumer debt load portend possibly slower future growth.  In orchestrating Visa\\'s expansion, Mr. Russell has hit a few wrong notes with bankers and competitors. Two years ago, he led the opposition against a merger proposal from rival MasterCard, an idea that some bank issuers of both cards thought would cut costs for them and consumers.  Mr. Russell says that the benefits were overrated and that a merger raises possible antitrust problems. Instead, he has backed joint efforts, but some question his interest in cooperating. Visa and MasterCard have been studying a national network to process retail store debit card transactions. Last fall, however, Visa agreed to manage a large similar operation in California, and some MasterCard officials worried that the joint venture had been doomed. Mr. Russell denies this.  His comments about American Express also have some precedent. Last summer, as part of a campaign to blunt another budding competitor, Visa encouraged members to refuse to honor Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\\'s Discover card in their automated teller machines.  Along the way, critics believe consumers have been cheated. Card rates haven\\'t fallen nearly as sharply as other interest rates since 1980. Current rates also reflect a jump in write-offs of bad credit card loans, which some banks have brought upon themselves through aggressive marketing.  Mr. Russell argues that usury laws depressed rates below market levels years ago, making current rates seem high. He also says critics ignore administrative costs in their rate attacks. The steeper write-offs, he contends, stem more from \"lax\" bankruptcy laws and heavy unemployment in the major oil-producing states than indiscriminate card marketing.  While Mr. Russell faces possible congressional and Justice Department investigations into his American Express comments, he says Visa welcomes the attention. \"We\\'ve nothing to hide, never had,\" adds the executive, who joined Visa in 1971.  Like scores of musicians, he put down his horn when television arrived in the 1950s. While hunting for a music-store job one day in 1953, a rainstorm forced him to take cover at a branch of what is now PNC Financial Corp. The bank hired him as a collector in its installment loan department. He married a former Pittsburgh radio singer who he used to back up in the band.  Weather permitting, Mr. Russell commutes every day from his Novato, Calif., home in his single-engine airplane. The 20-minute flight helps him forget his troubles. \"You can\\'t think about anything else when you\\'re flying,\" he says. \"When I fly home, I don\\'t have a problem anymore.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0084': '4th-Period Loss Vs. 1985 Profit --- By Teri Agins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> EARNINGS (ERN) AIRLINES (AIR) </IN> Pan Am Corp. reported a $197.5 million fourth-quarter loss, worse than it had predicted, and said it expects to post a deficit in the first quarter.  The fourth-quarter loss included $65 million of charges, mainly because of certain start-up costs of the Pan Am Shuttle, which began hourly service in the Northeast corridor last October; expenses related to the termination of leases of eight Boeing 747-100 aircraft; and expenses related to Pan Am\\'s sale of its Pacific division to UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, in 1985.  In the 1985 fourth quarter, Pan Am had net income of $241.4 million, or $1.79 a share, which included a $341 million gain from the Pacific division sale. Without that gain, Pan Am would have reported a 1985 fourth-quarter loss of about $100 million.  In the 1986 fourth quarter, revenue declined 12%, to $797.3 million from $906.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.  In mid-February, C. Edward Acker, Pan Am\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, had said the company expected a loss of more than $400 million for 1986, indicating a fourth-quarter deficit of more than $135 million.  He also had said that the company would be \"diligent\" in writing off costs, such as residual expenses associated with the Pacific division sale. The airline blamed the year\\'s losses on recent weak airline travel in Atlantic markets caused by the American public\\'s concern over terrorism abroad and the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  The airline said that it would report a loss for the first quarter but that it would be \"substantially less\" than the $118.4 million deficit it posted in the first quarter of 1986.  For all of 1986, Pan Am reported a loss of $462.8 million, compared with 1985 net income of $51.8 million, or 45 cents a share. Revenue declined 13% to $3.04 billion from $3.47 billion. Pan Am said its full-year results were hurt by foreign currency exchange losses of $46.8 million, primarily related to Japanese yen debt, compared with $11.1 million in 1985.  A Pan Am spokesman said the airline is \"nearing completion\" of its previously announced arrangement for a new line of financing. Pan Am said it has received a proposal from Citicorp Investment Bank for a $150 million credit line that will include a syndicate of other financial sources. He said Pan Am currently has \"in excess of $150 million\" in cash.  Pan Am said that based on advance reservations, second-quarter traffic should be \"vastly improved\" from a year earlier.  Mr. Acker previously said Pan Am would take major steps to become profitable in 1987, contingent on obtaining major reductions in labor costs. Pan Am recently said it will slash its operating expenses as much as $275 million, including cutting 464 management positions, freezing management salaries and reducing other expenses under management\\'s control. Pam Am has asked its five major labor unions to help cut labor costs 20%, or an additional $180 million a year.  In seeking concessions from its unions, Pan Am has said the airline might sell the shuttle operation to help return to profitability.  Even with these measures, Pan Am still faces a number of obstacles as it seeks to control costs and find ways to repay massive debt tied to aircraft purchases. At the end of 1986, long-term debt totaled $830 million.  Although the airline generally isn\\'t considered a likely merger candidate, AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, has looked at Pan Am but recently said it wouldn\\'t buy the company or the shuttle service. Pan Am has refused to sell AMR its valuable North Atlantic routes.  Pan Am\\'s unions, meanwhile, are trying to find another merger partner for the company. They have made their own cost-cutting proposals, but the two sides haven\\'t reached any agreements. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0083': 'A Private Concern Still Needs a Public Profile --- By Henry O. Timnick</HL> Huge, billion-dollar leveraged buyouts (LBOs) were a major feature on the 1986 financial landscape. This year, names like Viacom International Inc. and Owens-Illinois Inc. continue to steal headlines as tax-reform and takeover fears fuel LBO announcements and speculations.  Yet behind the headlines is the fact that well over 200 of the approximately 315 LBOs announced in 1986 were divestiture LBOs, in which overgrown conglomerates sold parts of their empires to division managers.  Where managers are resourceful and energetic, and believe in their capabilities as directors and owners -- rather than as employees -- LBOs have worked well. After the glow of pride fades from lining up the numbers and putting the deals together, what can corporate managers expect to find as the new owners of their former company stores?  One serious threat to success is the inability of some managers to make the transition from company men to entrepreneurs. Others become so absorbed with cost cutting and debt reduction that they forget to reinvest in the underlying business. Many managers also miss the abundant opportunities for reducing operating costs in areas where they have no technical competence, such as pensions, medical programs and insurance. Substantial savings can be realized in each of these areas without reducing benefits or coverage.  But the biggest danger in going private lies in management becoming close-mouthed. Many buyout groups react to freedom from quarterly earnings statements and shareholders by constructing moats around their companies. Building real value, whether a firm is public or private, means not only communicating company strategy to employees but talking with outsiders as well.  In 1979, I was a group president of Mead Corp. in charge of Virginia-based Stanley Furniture Co. Stanley was healthy but had not achieved its full potential as part of a big paper company. When I studied the situation I quickly realized that Mead would be better off without the $120 million contributed by furniture and fabric sales, and that Stanley would be better off without Mead\\'s corporate structure. Stanley no longer fit Mead\\'s strategy. It was also clear to me that furniture divisions of large corporate entities usually did not perform well. Therefore, Stanley\\'s managers opted for a leveraged buyout.  The risks our buyout group faced seven years ago were enormous -- personally and professionally. None of us was wealthy. We all had to take out second mortgages to help finance our investments in Stanley. Interest rates had surged beyond 20% and business was in its worst slump since World War II. Gone were the security, perks and resources of the parent company. If the venture failed, the 2,000 jobs that supported the economy of Stanleytown, Va., would disappear along with our investment. But I was confident that a revitalized Stanley, even as a highly leveraged enterprise, could prosper.  As an owner I learned that we needed to do more than agree on management objectives -- we had to communicate our resolve to everyone working at Stanley. This came to a head during an early planning session when a production manager asked what company policy was on a particular matter. \"I don\\'t know,\" I said. \"It\\'s our company now; we have to create the policy.\" From that point on we set in motion an open-door communications program to get both our managers and employees thinking like spirited owners. This type of aggressive dialogue wasn\\'t necessary under corporate rules where everyone knew his place, but it was an essential ingredient in our new company.  I made a special effort to keep our banks informed of our progress, much the way the chief executive officer of a public company gives updates to securities analysts. We discussed the results of marketing plans and new products with the banks and improved their feelings of confidence toward us at critical stages of our development. Similarly, we kept the press, customers and local officials informed of company developments.  When I had been a division president I rarely had time to spend with retailers, but as a manager-owner it was important for me to keep customers informed of our long-range plans. We also didn\\'t forget Stanleytown. Civic programs, such as scholarships and recreational facilities, were maintained and, in many cases, enhanced. In essence, Stanley was a private company with a public profile.  Our dialogue with employees extended to company finances as well. We opened the books to all managers and they in turn began to appreciate what cash flow was all about. Soon, they were no longer talking about what they had to have, but about what they no longer needed. We also set up performance incentives that reached well down the chain of command -- incentives based on long-term profitability, not just revenue growth.  Companies that undergo leveraged buyouts must learn quickly to cope with their problems in order to maximize cash flow and pay off debts without compromising growth. Many of the executives in these newly created private companies will protest that they don\\'t have the time or resources to waste on communicating their goals. But it is the obligation of management groups to talk candidly to employees and the outside world, especially during the early stages following a buyout. That\\'s when the greatest opportunity exists to shape an LBO company into an entrepreneurial enterprise.  --- Mr. Timnick, former chairman and CEO of Stanley Interiors Corp., is a principal of the New York-based private investment firm Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc.

Apcar and William Power Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN> A federal bankruptcy judge approved a complex bank-financing agreement for LTV Corp. that gives the company a new $100 million credit line.  Approval of the agreement between the Dallas-based aerospace, energy and steel concern and its 22-member bank group had been delayed since January. The amended plan, approved by Judge Burton Lifland in New York Friday, resolves certain objections by LTV's unsecured creditors and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal pension insurance agency that has taken over LTV's four big steel pension funds. Since last July, LTV has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code while it works out a plan to pay its debt.  One of the objections from the pension agency concerned that part of the financing agreement that repackages about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit. The original language in the financing agreement sounded too much like a formal, overall reorganization plan, the pension agency had said. The court-approved agreement converts the $435 million of debt and letters of credit into a new revolving credit facility.  In approving the refinancing, Judge Lifland also signed an order in which LTV agreed to provide detailed information to creditors about many of its cash transfers. The creditors had urged such a provision so they could monitor the agreement's tight restrictions on how much profit LTV can funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy products units.  LTV, in a statement, said it can use the $100 million bank line for borrowings and to cover new letters of credit. Loan proceeds may be used by LTV to meet the needs of its units, the company said.  LTV said the agreement also provides a revolving credit of about $160 million from which letters of credit can be drawn.  LTV said the agreement improves its liquidity by adding $100 million to its cash balances, which totaled $612 million at the end of 1986. Also, conversion of the $435 million in secured debt into a revolving credit facility gives LTV the flexibility to repay and reborrow the funds as needed, the company said.

       " 'WSJ870323-0078': '--- By Regina E. Herzlinger</HL> Because hospitals represent the single largest expenditure in the U.S. health-care system, much of the current concern over burgeoning costs has focused on them. Reviews of hospital utilization and radical changes in hospital payment mechanisms have been introduced to curb expenses -- but to little avail. In 1986, while general inflation was only 2%, hospital expenses grew 8%.  These cost-control attempts so far have ignored the important fact that most American hospitals are operated as private, nonprofit corporations that have no structural reason to be efficient. Because they have no owners and no equity capital, nonprofits are freed from the scrutiny and interests of owners and the stock market. Because they are not government-run, they are freed from taxpayers\\' and legislators\\' oversight.  In a study of comparable for-profit and nonprofit hospital chains, I found that the nonprofits have higher costs, spend more on labor and have a lower turnover per hospital bed than their for-profit counterparts. Nonprofits also defer replacing their plant and equipment for longer periods, thus placing more of the burden of that replacement on the shoulders of future generations of users. These inefficiencies are subsidized by taxpayers\\' granting the nonprofits exemptions from most income, sales and, sometimes, real-estate taxes and by the ability of most nonprofit hospitals to borrow money at the cheaper interest rates of tax-exempt bonds.  Subsidies give nonprofit hospitals a substantial cost advantage over for-profits -- on the order of 3% to 6% of revenues. This enabled the nonprofits in my study to have the same prices as for-profits and still have higher costs. But, most important, I could find no difference between for-profit and nonprofit hospital chains in the amount of care given to patients who are uninsured or have low-paying Medicaid insurance.  Most of the 30 million uninsured patients in the U.S. are \"dumped\" on the public hospitals run by municipal, county and federal governments.  But as things now stand, it is not up to the for-profit hospital to provide care for the uninsured, any more than it is a supermarket\\'s responsibility to feed the poor. The nonprofit hospital, on the other hand, has received a tax exemption primarily in exchange for treating those who cannot afford to pay for their health care. Dumping by the nonprofits is a grave violation of this social contract. But until we enact a system that guarantees payment for the care of uninsured patients, they will continue to be dumped on the public hospitals by the private hospitals, both for-profit and nonprofit.  Why do the nonprofit hospitals use their tax exemptions to subsidize higher expenses rather than to reduce prices or to provide greater services for the uninsured? Because nonprofit hospitals are dominated by powerful doctors, who structure them for their comfort and convenience by increasing the levels of support personnel and capital. For example, many nonprofit hospitals have opened extra operating rooms so that their surgeons can operate between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. and not be forced to wait for an inconvenient early-morning, late-evening or weekend time slot. Others have extra beds and staff so that a doctor can admit his patients at his convenience, rather than when an opening occurs.  I do not mean that nonprofits malevolently trade off the welfare of their physicians against the welfare of the uninsured, but rather that their physicians inevitably have a much more powerful voice in the day-to-day decisions made in running a hospital than do the poor or the society that subsidizes the nonprofit hospital. The for-profit hospital, in contrast, has a powerful social voice in the form of equity markets. If its costs are excessive, its returns will slump and more efficient competitors will enter the market. Also, the for-profits do not have many tax breaks to cushion them from their inefficiencies -- even the investment tax credit was lost in the last wave of tax reform.  Some advocates of nonprofit hospitals claim that their higher costs result in higher quality -- a claim yet to be proved. Others claim that only the nonprofit hospitals can generate the great medical advances from which we have all benefited. But most nonprofits do no research. It is mostly the teaching hospitals, affiliated with medical schools, that conduct research. They represent only 17% of U.S. hospitals, and some of them are run on a for-profit basis. The claimed equivalence of research superiority and the nonprofit form is also undermined by the impressive discoveries made by for-profit companies in pharmacology, biotechnology, and medical equipment and devices.  The American hospital sector spent $181 billion in 1986. If all these hospitals -- nonprofit, for-profit and government -- had paid federal income taxes at average corporate tax rates, federal revenues of between $3 billion and $6 billion would have been yielded. These revenues could then have been used for many purposes, such as funding those people without medical insurance. Most important, the huge hospital sector would likely become much more efficient by its transformation to a for-profit, tax-paying entity, subject to the intense scrutiny of its owners.  --- Mrs. Herzlinger is McPherson professor of business administration at the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration.

       " 'WSJ870323-0077': 'Facility to Ease Acid-Rain Problem --- By Alan Freeman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ENVIRONMENT (ENV) MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN> Noranda Inc. said it plans to build a $125 million (Canadian) sulfuric acid plant at its copper smelter in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, in an effort to clean up a major source of acid-rain pollution.  The plant is designed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at the smelter by 50%, to 276,000 metric tons annually in 1990 from 552,000 in 1980. The plant will use gases produced by the copper smelter to produce sulfuric acid.  The Canadian government and the province of Quebec will each provide one-third of the project\\'s cost, with Noranda, a Toronto-based natural resources concern, paying the remaining one-third. Noranda will repay the governments with interest under certain unspecified conditions.  The Noranda smelter, with smelting capacity of 960,000 metric tons a year, produces 50% of Quebec\\'s emissions that can cause acid rain, according to a government official, and the project will result in meeting more than 20% of the Canadian government\\'s target for acid-rain emission reduction in eastern Canada.  Canada\\'s environment minister, Tom McMillan, said that government aid to the project is part of Canada\\'s \"clean hands approach\" in trying to prod Washington to take more action to clean up U.S. sources of sulfur-dioxide pollution. U.S. critics of Canada\\'s stand have said that Canada isn\\'t doing enough to clean its own sources of the pollution.  Last week, President Reagan said he will ask Congress to approve a new $2.5 billion (U.S.) five-year plan to study new approaches to cleaning up the problem. But environmentalists criticized the approach because it doesn\\'t actually involve an emission-control program at U.S. power plants, factories and other pollution sources.  The plant at Rouyn-Noranda will produce more than 350,000 metric tons of sulfuric acid a year but because of the distance to markets, Noranda said it expects a large operating deficit from the facility. These costs plus Noranda\\'s share of capital will result in the company\\'s carrying about 70% of the financial burden attached to the facility, the company said.

Billboard publishes eight specialty magazines, including Billboard magazine, a weekly that covers the entertainment industry, and Backstage, a news magazine for commercial film production and theatrical services. The company also publishes 15 annual directories, owns the book publisher Watson-Guptill and electronically distributes information world-wide.  Specific terms of the acquisition plan weren\\'t disclosed, but Affiliated said Billboard will be operated as a separate subsidiary. Affiliated also said that under a separate agreement, certain members of Billboard\\'s present management plan to buy as much as 10% of the equity in Billboard Publications following the acquisition.  Some analysts applauded Affiliated for the acquisition. Kevin Gruneich, a vice president at First Boston Corp., said some investors were concerned that Affiliated might spend too much money for an acquisition as it had built up a sizable cash position. In December, the company sold six radio stations for $65.5 million.  But Billboard \"puts another leg on the stool,\" said Mr. Gruneich. \"Affiliated is not only making a very good strategic decision by moving into specialty magazines, but they got it at a reasonable price.\"  In 1986, Affiliated had net income of $66.1 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $401 million. Those earnings comprised profit of $39.8 million from continuing operations and $26.3 million from discontinued operations. Per-share earnings were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in January. Billboard had sales of $58 million last year and is expecting sales of $62 million in 1987, said Mr. Hobbs. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0075': 'USAir Purchases Of Piedmont Stock --- By Laurie McGinley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) AIRLINES (AIR) TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN> The Transportation Department said USAir Group Inc. could acquire no more than 51% of Piedmont Aviation Inc. pending final approval of the merger by the department.  The decision, while allowing USAir to continue buying Piedmont stock, still is a setback for USAir. The airline had told the department that Piedmont had insisted, as a condition of the merger, that USAir offer to buy all Piedmont shares.  USAir already has begun a tender offer as part of its agreement to acquire the parent of Piedmont Airlines for $69 a share, or $1.59 billion.  USAir must place its Piedmont shares in a voting trust, but can instruct the trustee to vote them on the merger. On other issues, USAir had proposed allowing Piedmont\\'s outside directors to decide how to vote the shares in the trust. But the department said that on such issues, the shares must be voted proportionately with the shares USAir doesn\\'t own.  The ruling effectively denies USAir control of Piedmont until the department completes its review of the proposed merger.  The transportation agency, with the Justice Department\\'s support, rejected USAir\\'s application to acquire all of Piedmont\\'s shares, saying the arrangement wouldn\\'t have sufficiently shielded Piedmont from USAir influence.  USAir had told the Transportation Department that, under the merger agreement, USAir may be required to pay Piedmont as much as an additional $21 million if USAir isn\\'t able to buy all the Piedmont shares.  But the department said that in most merger cases it has restricted purchases to 51% until the merger was approved. \"USAir knew or should have been aware of our voting trust precedents limiting the amount of stock which could be acquired pending review of the underlying acquisition, and it assumed a risk when it agreed to the penalty,\" the department said.  A spokesman for USAir said the decision \"does not change our plans at all, and we are continuing our plans to acquire Piedmont.\" In Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokesman for Piedmont declined to comment.  In other action, the department extended until April 6 the period for those wishing to comment on Trans World Airlines\\'s application to create a voting trust to acquire 25% of USAir\\'s stock.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Piedmont shares closed at $67.75, up 12.5 cents, on volume of 1.1 million shares, and USAir shares closed at $44.75, off 37.5 cents. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0074': 'Are Laying Groundwork for a Merger --- By Michael Siconolfi Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> New York\\'s two largest futures exchanges, following a recent shift in leadership, are laying the groundwork for a merger, exchange officials said.  Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange in New York held private exploratory talks at an annual Futures Industry Association convention here late last week. And officials said a recently formed joint merger committee will be stepping up efforts to examine the issue. The ad hoc committee consists of four board members from each exchange.  The potential benefits of a merger would be enormous for both marketplaces, industry officials say. A combined entity would give New York more visibility in an industry dominated by Chicago, they say. That, in turn, would translate into far greater competitive clout than either the New York Merc or Comex now has, particularly in marketing new products, the industry officials say. Further, the exchanges would save money by merging and, for traders, there would be a wider array of markets in which to participate, they add.  Currently, the New York Merc trades energy futures, along with platinum and palladium, while the Comex trades gold, silver, copper and aluminum contracts.  Merger speculation was fueled in part by comments made here by William M. Bradt, the New York Merc\\'s new chairman and a member of both exchanges. Mr. Bradt, in public and private discussions, said pursuing the possibility of a merger is one of the leading items on his agenda.  \"I\\'ll be pushing and pushing and pushing for it,\" Mr. Bradt said. Added Alan J. Brody, the recently elected chairman of Comex: \"There is a groundswell\" of support for a merger among Comex members.  Skeptics abound, however. The idea of a Comex-New York Merc merger isn\\'t new; the exchanges have flirted with such a move on and off for nearly 10 years. And some futures industry officials and traders, while conceding a merger makes sense on paper, question whether either exchange\\'s membership would ever agree to it.  \"Most traders are just too independent,\" argued James Kurt Dew, a consultant to the Comex. Others contend that conflicting personalities and big egos will get in the way.  Nevertheless, there is a renewed sense of optimism among exchange leaders, especially at the New York Merc, where Mr. Bradt last week succeeded Michel D. Marks, chairman since 1978. Mr. Bradt is perceived by many as \"more flexible\" than Mr. Marks, said Lewis J. Horowitz, president of the New York Futures Exchange, a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary.  Mr. Brody, formerly Comex president and recently elected as the first full-time salaried chairman of the exchange, said that informal talks here resulted from the two exchanges\\' \"commitment to making serious headway\" toward combining.  The joint merger committee will initially focus on several areas, including common clearing, floor facilities and trading systems, said A. George Gero, New York Merc treasurer and a committee member.  Mr. Bradt, who before his election was a member of the committee, said he sees \"more people willing to listen than ever before\" to merger prospects.  After a private dinner meeting with Mr. Bradt and other New York Merc officials, Fowler C. West, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that with Mr. Bradt\\'s apparent tenaciousness, \"there seems to be a new initiative\" in the merger area. Mr. West added that he didn\\'t foresee any regulatory problems with such a move.  Industry officials said any combination probably would be the first step toward a merger of all five New York exchanges. The New York Merc, Comex, Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and Cotton Exchange all occupy the same space at the World Trade Center, while the New York Futures Exchange is located adjacent to the Big Board a few blocks away. Some industry executives stressed, however, that a combination of the five would face much stiffer opposition than a merger of the New York Merc and Comex.  And even with a merger, the combined New York Merc-Comex still would be dwarfed by the nation\\'s two largest exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which together capture more than three-quarters of all U.S. futures trading volume.  Moreover, any merger would take time; industry executives suggested it would take more than two years to work out. Nevertheless, New York exchange leaders say they\\'re striving for a combination before a planned move to a new building, which is expected to be completed by about 1990.  In the meantime, with the markets becoming more interrelated, there is an increased awareness of the benefit of such a move, exchange officials said.  And some futures executives say that newer, younger traders at the New York exchanges are not as opposed as some of the older members to breaking down exchange boundaries.  \"It won\\'t happen tomorrow, but it\\'ll be sooner than expected,\" says Mr. Horowitz.

       " 'WSJ870323-0073': 'Highway Bill To President --- Increase in the Speed Limit In Some Areas Backed; Reagan Pledges a Veto --- By Laurie McGinley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> Congress, setting up a confrontation with President Reagan, cleared a five-year, $88 billion highway bill that includes a provision to let states raise the speed limit on interstate highways.  The Senate Friday voted 60-21 to allow states to increase the speed limit to 65 miles per hour, from 55 mph currently, on most rural interstate highways. The speed-limit provision then was folded into the overall highway bill and sent to the White House. President Reagan has vowed to veto the measure as too costly.  While proponents of the combined bill stand a good chance of being able to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override a presidential veto, some on Capitol Hill said such an outcome wasn\\'t assured. The House approved the highway spending provisions last Wednesday by an overwhelming 407-17 vote. But the speed-limit change squeaked through that chamber 217-206.  Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) had said Thursday that he planned to try to get the Senate to adopt a cheaper highway bill that might be acceptable to the president and avert a veto. But Sen. Dole announced Friday that he decided against offering the amendment. Instead, he said he would propose a less-expensive highway bill -- probably the four-year, $65 billion one the Senate approved earlier this year -- after Mr. Reagan\\'s expected veto of the more costly measure.  President Reagan suggested Friday that he would accept the earlier Senate version. \"I am in full support of reasonable funding levels for these programs similar to the legislation passed by the Senate,\" he said in a statement put out by the White House. \"But I am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is in the bill as it emerged from the conference committee.\"  The president objected mainly to the inclusion, at the House\\'s insistence, of extra funds for more than 150 special highway projects. He also opposed funding levels for mass transit. The bill authorizes about $18 billion for mass transit and $70 billion for highway programs.  Mr. Reagan supports granting states the authority to raise the speed limit, but he won\\'t be able to sign that portion of the bill separately from the spending provisions. The 55 mph national speed limit was set in 1974 in response to an energy crisis, but supporters say that it has saved thousands of lives since then. Critics say it is widely ignored and difficult to enforce.  Backers of the overall highway bill warned that if President Reagan\\'s expected veto isn\\'t overridden, Congress might be unable to act on new highway legislation for several more months. That could jeopardize the summer construction season and tens of thousands of jobs.  The highway program expired Sept. 30. Congress deadlocked last October over reauthorization legislation. State officials and highway groups say several states already are running low on highway cash, and are pressing hard for new legislation. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0072': 'To Be Paid Interest in the Form of Notes --- By Peter Truell and Lee Berton Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) </IN> The Philippines\\' major creditor banks have accepted a proposal under which they may choose to receive some interest payments in the form of notes, sources close to the country\\'s debt talks said.  Their acceptance establishes an important precedent for future settlements with other debtor countries. It also raises the accounting question of how banks will value such notes.  Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin and his country\\'s main creditor banks still are working to reach agreement on other issues in rescheduling more than $13 billion of debt, including $10.3 billion of medium-term and long-term debt owed to foreign banks and $3 billion of trade financing. Talks on those issues will resume later this week.  The note proposal, which has drawn approving comments from U.S. Treasury officials, gives creditor banks the option to take payments covering the interest-rate margin on Philippine debt in so-called Philippine Investment Notes. These notes, denominated in U.S. dollars and not paying interest, could be exchanged for local currency for investment in the Philippines\\' debt-for-equity swap program. Banks will be offered a slightly higher interest-rate margin if they accept the notes than if they take a cash payment.  The Philippines has proposed that the interest-rate margin for cash payments be 5/8 percentage point over the banks\\' cost of funds, while the notes would have a face value equal to a one-point margin over the cost of funds. But the margins have yet to be resolved.  Other debtor countries, eager to encourage debt-for-equity swaps and to limit cash payments on their debt in foreign currencies, probably will want to take advantage of an option such as the Philippines\\' note proposal.  Meanwhile, because accounting principles haven\\'t been established yet for the notes, banks that choose to take the notes likely will be on their own in either accepting them at par value or discounting them because they\\'re only exchangeable into Philippine pesos, a restricted foreign currency.  Major U.S. accounting firms are split on how to value the notes. At the conservative end is Price Waterhouse, which audits major U.S. banks and would have them sharply discount the notes. The more liberal view, opposing such a discount, is taken by the accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co., which is a consultant to investment bankers advising the Philippines.  A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said: \"We hope the Philippine debt talks move toward a smooth conclusion.\" But he declined to comment on the issue of the notes.  The Philippines and its bankers still have to resolve the question of interest-rate margins, and also have to agree who will monitor the Philippine economy once the country\\'s present International Monetary Fund program expires in the middle of next year.  Talks on these issues were adjourned over the weekend to allow some bankers to attend the Inter-American Development Bank\\'s annual meeting in Miami. The talks will resume later this week, with the more-optimistic negotiators expecting an agreement before the weekend. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0071': 'In Inquiry Dents Beer Firm\\'s Image --- By Robert L. Rose and Robert Johnson Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) </IN> FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) The abrupt departure of three Anheuser-Busch Cos. executives amid allegations of improper payments has dented one of the nation\\'s most carefully constructed corporate images.  Since the Budweiser Clydesdales first paraded to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Anheuser-Busch has cast itself as a bastion of all-American wholesomeness. Under August Busch III, the straight-laced chairman, president and great-grandson of the founder, the St. Louis-based company has crusaded against drunken driving and drug abuse, sponsored sports events and, as always, displayed the huge horses at parades and county fairs.  \"It\\'s a straight-arrow company culture,\" says a former Anheuser-Busch executive. \"August Busch III doesn\\'t accept gifts from suppliers, and employees know that.\"  Thus the recent allegations of improper dealings with a now-defunct advertising and promotional agency, Hanley Worldwide Inc., stunned employees of the tightknit brewing industry leader, and its competitors as well.  Joseph E. Martino, vice president, sales, of the company\\'s beer unit; John C. Lodge, manager of national sales promotion events, and Michael A. Orloff, vice president of the beer unit\\'s wholesale operations division, abruptly departed Anheuser-Busch two weeks ago, during an internal investigation by the company.  Anheuser-Busch won\\'t comment on its investigation, except to say that it focuses on \"allegations of improper conduct by certain employees and suppliers.\" At least some of the allegations came in disputed statements made more than a year ago in a bankruptcy court proceeding.  Nevertheless, the probe most likely will spawn new ethics rules at the big brewer, and a tightening of controls on promotional spending. And Anheuser-Busch\\'s embarrassment could prompt other brewers to review practices in the high-rolling beer-promotion field, where spending will top $400 million this year.  Few employees better personified Anheuser-Busch\\'s clean-cut image than the three departed executives. Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff, both graduates of the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Wharton School, joined the company in 1979 as brand managers and soon hit the fast track.  After a stint as executive assistant to Dennis P. Long, the beer unit president and the No. 2 executive in the parent company, the 34-year-old Mr. Martino was seen by insiders as Mr. Long\\'s heir apparent. Still single, with a girlfriend in St. Louis, he recently bought a large, Tudor-style home in a quiet St. Louis neighborhood of big lawns and long driveways.  Mr. Lodge, meanwhile, was sculpting a high profile for Anheuser-Busch in the fast-paced beer-promotion arena, where the company is the biggest spender by far. As manager of national sales promotions events, he was breaking new ground for the company by working through black promoters and minority-owned promotional agencies. He also was guiding Anheuser-Busch deeper into splashy concert promotions, such as last year\\'s Superfest tour, featuring the Temptations and other black and Hispanic groups.  \"He\\'s as clean-cut as you can get . . . real dynamic in preppie blazers and red ties,\" says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter. Adds a former Anheuser-Busch executive: \"All three of these guys are right out of pages of a study of yuppies.\"  But the company inquiry, which began a few months ago, changed everything. The impetus apparently was a few minutes of murky testimony in the three-year liquidation case of Hanley Worldwide under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The case continues in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in St. Louis.  As long as a year ago, Hanley\\'s bankruptcy trustee charged in a lawsuit filed in the court that St. Louis-based Hanley paid a car dealer $13,500 toward the 1982 purchase of a Porsche for Mr. Lodge. The trustee contended in a subsequent court filing that the payment was made partly to induce Mr. Lodge to funnel business to Hanley. Mr. Lodge\\'s attorney says that if the agency paid for part of the cost of the car, his client wasn\\'t aware of it.  The allegations against the other two executives are far more serious, and still more murky. A review of the official tape recording of the bankruptcy court proceeding shows that in February 1986, a former Hanley executive reluctantly repeated what he called \"hearsay\" about Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff. The statements were made under oath in answer to questions from lawyers involved in the case.  The former executive, William E. Bartlett, said he was told that \"fictitious invoices\" for $250,000 were sent to Anheuser-Busch, and that the money was split between Hanley\\'s owner, an associate of Hanley\\'s owner and Mr. Martino. Under further questioning, he also told of \"hearsay\" that Mr. Orloff had received $25,000.  The former executive said the source of the information about both Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff was Hanley\\'s owner, Marvin Cotlar. But Mr. Cotlar\\'s attorney, Milton P. Goldfarb, said Friday his client had made no such statements. And Gerald A. Rimmel, the bankruptcy trustee, has said he found no evidence that Hanley made payments to either executive.  Thomas M. Walsh, an attorney for both Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff, declined to comment.  Whatever the case, the three executives left within two days of one another.  While one or more of the executives may be cleared, the investigation\\'s ripple effects are likely to linger in the brewing industry. Anheuser-Busch isn\\'t the first big brewer to hit ethical shoals in beer promotion: Last November, Miller Brewing Co., the No. 2 brewer, won a $1.9 million settlement from a now-defunct New York promotions agency.  Miller, a Milwaukee-based unit of Philip Morris Inc., charged in a lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee that the agency had used money that was supposed to be paid to sponsor auto races and other events to buy racehorses and furnish lavish residences. \"We were getting bills for things we thought the promotions agency had already paid,\" says Alan Easton, Miller\\'s vice president of corporate affairs.  The stakes in beer promotion and advertising are rising so fast that some executives say effective controls are difficult. Anheuser-Busch\\'s ad and promotional spending per six-pack has doubled since 1980, according to Beer Marketer\\'s Insights, a West Nyack, N.Y.-based newsletter. The company spent roughly $207 million on promotions in 1985, according to Advertising Age.  And the big Midwestern brewers that dominate the industry often know little about the glitzy, fast-paced world of promotion. \"The promotions business is one that needs to be watched carefully,\" says Miller\\'s Mr. Easton. \"Our business is beer; we don\\'t know much about things like racing and concerts.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0070': 'TV: Big Bad Businessmen --- By Martha Bayles</HL> Readers of this newspaper will remember a flurry of articles a few years ago about the negative images of businessmen on TV. Some were excerpted from a 1981 Media Institute study that compiled statistical evidence that TV dramas and comedies portrayed businessmen as \"crooks, con men and clowns.\" Others came from Ben Stein\\'s 1979 book, \"The View From Sunset Boulevard,\" and argued that the ubiquitous corporate villain was one of several systematic distortions found in the medium.  Has there been any improvement since then? Not according to a new film called \"Hollywood\\'s Favorite Heavy\" (airing Wednesday, 9-10 p.m. EST, on most PBS stations). Echoing these criticisms, narrator Eli Wallach explains: \"The businessmen you see portrayed on TV seem to make an awful lot of money, without ever having to work hard or produce useful products. To succeed, all they seem to do is lie, steal, cheat, blackmail, even murder.\"  In addition to echoing past criticism, the film reenacts some of it. For example, Mr. Stein\\'s book describes his unsuccessful efforts to pitch the idea of a TV series with a businessman hero. The film opens with a staged conversation between Mr. Stein and Al Burton, an executive producer at Universal Studios, in which Mr. Stein halfheartedly pitches a show about \"a guy who is a venture capitalist, and the adventure each episode is starting some little company.\" Mr. Burton passes, saying that the whole thing makes him \"yawn emotionally.\" Then Mr. Stein pounces, with his familiar accusation: \"Do you think the problem is a businessman being the hero?\"  The scene would be more persuasive if Mr. Stein didn\\'t also seem to be yawning emotionally at his eight-year-old idea. At any rate, his eight-year-old criticism still applies to plenty of contemporary TV shows -- especially crime dramas, for the simple reason that they require a constant supply of bad guys. In interviews with prominent TV writers, producers and network executives, we learn two reasons why the businessman continues to be television\\'s villain of choice.  First, by default. A writer for \"The A-Team\" claims that mobsters cannot be the heavies any more, because the networks don\\'t want to be accused of stereotyping Italian Americans. \"You can\\'t say \\'Mafia,\\'\" he adds. Other interviewees, such as a creator of \"Miami Vice,\" imply that any trace of ethnicity is a no-no: \"The easiest mark is to put some white-bread character in a three-piece suit who is a white-collar criminal.\"  Second, most viewers are considered too stupid to relate to less-obvious bad guys. As a writer for \"The Fall Guy\" puts it, most writers and producers \"assume that their audiences are \\'lumpen proletariat\\' that are drooling and eating frozen dinners, not even heating them because they can\\'t master the microwave. Yeah, they\\'re just sucking them until they get warm!\" These audiences \"are going to understand if you say business is bad . . . everyone\\'s going to say \\'Yeah, right!\\'\"  Even if this description fit the average TV viewer, it would still beg the question: Why are businessmen seen as such obvious stock villains? One explanation might be that TV people themselves dislike business. In his book, Mr. Stein suggests a bias on the part of Hollywood\\'s \"creative community\" against the pin-striped, ratings-obsessed \"suits\" from the networks. He also hints that differences in culture, values and background might incline the crowd on Sunset Boulevard to take a dim view of America\\'s corporate elite.  Unfortunately, these interesting speculations don\\'t make it into the film. Instead, we are treated to the spectacle of Mr. Stein browbeating the interviewees about \"ideological preferences.\" And the film starts to feel outdated when Mr. Wallach explains: \"In the late \\'60s and early \\'70s, the mood of the country changed. The Vietnam War, environmental crises and Watergate shook the nation\\'s faith in its institutions. And TV reflected this new anti-establishment perspective.\"  Right on target, for 1979 or 1981. But this is 1987, and TV has a new type of corporate villain: the lovable/hateable member of the family, such as J.R. on \"Dallas\" or Alexis on \"Dynasty.\" \"Hollywood\\'s Favorite Heavy\" acknowledges the existence of these new villains, and admits that they contrast strikingly with the usual crime-drama villain, who brandishes a weapon or dumps toxic chemicals just long enough to get caught by the hero. But it fails to do them justice.  In reply to the argument that popular culture has always used tycoons as heavies, the film points to melodramatic movies of the \\'40s and \\'50s, in which the wicked businessman was usually thwarted by a virtuous businessman. It adds that these movies accepted the basic legitimacy of the business system. Yet it draws no parallel between these older films and a show like \"Dallas\" -- which is nothing if not a melodrama, opposing the greedy, unscrupulous schemes of J.R. to the honorable practices of Bobby; and expressing reverence toward the generation of Jock Ewing for having built a fortune out of mother wit, sweat and Texas dirt.  Since their inception in the early \\'80s, the prime-time soaps have dabbled in total corruption -- Bobby, Blake, Chase and Karen have each acted reprehensibly at times. But soon enough, they have repented and gone back to their upright ways. The producers know perfectly well that without these noble characters, their whole formula would collapse. Without these pillars of goodness, all those satiny billows of evil would have no support.  \"Hollywood\\'s Favorite Heavy\" ends with a couple of sequences in which ordinary viewers talk about the prime-time soaps: a group of women in a beauty parlor, and a class of high school students under interrogation by Herb London, a dean at New York University. The women demonstrate a keen grasp of how the soaps exaggerate wickedness for melodramatic, and sometimes comic, effect. The high school students, on the other hand, express admiration for the amoral behavior of J.R. and his ilk, and declare that if they were in business, they would probably act the same way.  The film makers, Michael Pack and Dan Polin, told me that they consider this high school sequence to be the most interesting and revealing in the film. Norman Lear is shown gasping with horror at it, and Messrs. Wallach and Stein base their final statements on it. Unfortunately, no former teacher like me can give any credence to a discussion in which an adult works so heavily at getting pliable young people to tell him exactly what he wants to hear. The film would have done far better to pick up on the nuanced, amused remarks of the beauty-parlor women -- who, after all, could be the high schoolers\\' mothers. But then it would have had to offer its own statement about why TV has returned to the business melodrama, and that would have been a lot harder than simply repeating old criticisms. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0069': 'Soviet Changes: Revolution or Reform? --- By Henry S. Rowen</HL> Striking events are happening in Moscow. Plays, films, literary works whose appearance would have been impossible a few years ago are now on the scene. Andrei Sakharov returns from Gorky; many other dissidents are released from the Gulag; Mikhail Gorbachev speaks of having competition in elections to party positions; and family businesses are made legal.  How fundamental are the changes these events portend? In \"The Waking Giant: Gorbachev\\'s Russia\" (Pantheon, 298 pages, $17.95), Martin Walker, the Manchester Guardian\\'s Moscow correspondent since 1984, says that the situation is \"revolutionary.\" More importantly, Mr. Gorbachev describes it that way as well. As Mr. Walker puts it, the situation is driven by the emergence of a new class, well-educated, relatively prosperous, influential, frustrated by the inefficiencies and dreariness of Soviet life and keenly aware of Soviet backwardness. This class wants to see the system reformed.  \"Reform\" is not \"revolution.\" Mr. Walker\\'s informed and sympathetic descriptions of the struggle to gain more freedom for the arts, of the emergence of a feminist movement (in a country where women have a truly hard lot), of recent economic experiments, suggest that the modification of the existing system, not its transformation, is the aim of most of those pushing for change; and there are many in the Politburo, Central Committee and Communist Party who resist even this.  Mr. Gorbachev may indeed want some big changes; at least he says some bold things. He sometimes asserts that there is a need for flexible prices linked to demand as well as cost; that farmers should be able to market their produce; and that wages should be linked to personal -- and organizational -- performance. But, as Mr. Walker observes, the system has little room for maneuver. The party and bureaucracy resist, needed price increases could result in riots, and Mr. Gorbachev might go, as did Nikita Khrushchev, in a \"Putsch.\"  The economic system and its performance are of central importance, and Mr. Walker\\'s treatment of them is inadequate. Soviet real national income did not grow at anything like the 62% rate during the 1970s that Mr. Walker claims; the improvements in the Brezhnev years were mostly over by the mid-1970s. Contrary to Mr. Walker\\'s assertion, an arms race in space will definitely not boost the Soviet economy. Mr. Gorbachev is clearer on this when he complains to Ronald Reagan that the American Strategic Defense Initiative is designed to drive the Soviet Union into bankruptcy.  The basic cause of Soviet economic malaise is the command structure of the economy, but the Soviets are also hurt, much more than Mr. Walker acknowledges, by the enormous share of resources taken by the military and related activities throughout the Soviet empire. As Mr. Gorbachev tries to hold down military spending and shift resources into investment, Mr. Walker sees, plausibly, that the surface navy and the Soviet forces along the Chinese border will likely be most affected.  If Mr. Walker deserves good grades for his reportage of Kremlin personalities and the cultural scene, and (at best) an incomplete on economic matters, he flunks on geopolitics. Here his stance is nominally neutral, but it is operationally favorable to the Soviets (or rather to his notion of what Mr. Gorbachev stands for). His arguments are depressingly familiar: The invasion of Afghanistan is just one of those things that empires do; the \"For every Afghanistan there is a Vietnam\" syndrome. The old Soviet fear of being surrounded by enemies compels the country to break out and dominate its neighbors. Moreover, the West\\'s support for corrupt and brutal regimes in the Third World is the real reason for Soviet expansion there.  Of course we need to try to understand the Soviet Union better, but to those on the receiving end of Soviet bullets and bombs, whether directly or indirectly delivered (no hint at Soviet support of terrorists pops up in Mr. Walker\\'s book), it is present Soviet behavior that matters most, not the terrible past that has warped its collective psyche.  Mr. Walker suggests that the West has an interest in maintaining the \"physical and territorial integrity of the Soviet state\" and that the failure of Mr. Gorbachev\\'s program might produce a collapse with consequent chaos -- a united Germany, a European crisis and, perhaps, general war.  So let us help Mr. Gorbachev, he urges. We have been hearing this line from West Germany\\'s foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and we will hear more of it from others in coming months. The problem with this line is that the Soviet system is all too stable; that is, too resistant to change. Help from the West simply makes it easier for its rulers to maintain their inefficient system.  --- Mr. Rowen is professor of public management at the Graduate School of Business and senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

       " 'WSJ870323-0068': 'Raised Issue of Whose Board to Serve --- By Francine Schwadel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> Claudine B. Malone faced an unusual dilemma when she learned in mid-February that Dart Group Corp. was considering a bid for Supermarkets General Corp.  For eight years, the 50-year-old teacher and management consultant from McLean, Va., had served as an outside director on the boards of both companies. And she realized the potential for a conflict of interest. \"It was clear that I had to resign from one or more boards,\" she says.  So, after discussing her options with a lawyer, Ms. Malone resigned Feb. 28 from the board of Dart Group and its affiliate, Trak Auto Corp., choosing to remain on the board of the company that became Dart\\'s target. She is now \"a full participant in our deliberations,\" according to a Supermarkets General spokesman. The Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer is mulling a $1.62 billion unsolicited takeover proposal that Dart made March 6, as well as alternatives that include seeking another suitor.  Few directors are ever thrust into Ms. Malone\\'s position, but her decision strikes some experts as odd. \"I would have gotten off both boards,\" says John M. Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors. \"She has a lot of information in her head about the acquiring company and there may be information there that may be useful to Supermarkets General in their defense. I think she\\'s walking a very thin line.\"  Adds Barbara Hackman Franklin, a corporate director who heads the government and business program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia: \"It sounds like an awkward situation at best.\"  Ms. Malone, who is black and serves on the boards of several other big companies, defends her decision. \"It didn\\'t seem to me that what\\'s in my head about the Hafts (the father and son who head the discount retailer) and Dart was that germane to this transaction,\" she says. \"My conversations with the Supermarkets General people did not lead me to think I should resign from Supermarkets General\\'s board as well.\"  Moreover, Robert Haft, the 34-year-old president of Landover, Md.-based Dart and a former student of Ms. Malone\\'s, doesn\\'t consider her a traitor. Instead, he seems to think of her as a potentially sympathetic ear on the Supermarkets General board.  He says Ms. Malone maintains \"a complete wall\" between her various board activities and provided no help on Dart\\'s bid. But he adds that she \"understands our business operations and our abilities\" and \"our resolve to acquire a third retailing business.\" Dart currently operates two discount retailing operations, Crown Books Corp. and the Trak Auto chain of automotive supplies stores.  Officials of Supermarkets General, which has indicated a strong desire to remain independent, say they never questioned her loyalty. \"She resigned from the Dart board and she therefore has no conflict of interest,\" says the spokesman.  Ms. Malone, who teaches part-time at the University of Virginia\\'s business school, won\\'t say why Dart\\'s was the seat she gave up. She says only that the choice was difficult: \"I had longstanding, good relationships with both groups, which I valued personally and professionally.\"  Not everyone would say that about the Hafts. They have a reputation for putting companies into play and selling back stakes in their targets for a premium, a practice known as \"greenmail.\" Last year, when Mr. Haft and his father, Herbert, made a bid for Safeway Stores Inc., the nation\\'s largest supermarket chain, they were quickly rebuffed. Safeway went private, and the Hafts made a profit of about $140 million on their stake. Some analysts have speculated that Dart might be more interested in putting Supermarkets General into play than in buying it. Currently Dart owns less than a 5% stake.  Ms. Malone\\'s Dart and Supermarkets General ties go back to the 1970s, when she taught at Harvard Business School. The elder Mr. Haft, Dart chairman, attended one of her seminars, as did Leonard Lieberman, chairman and chief executive officer of Supermarkets General. Robert Haft took her course while studying for his MBA.  When Dart was looking for an outside director in 1979, the younger Mr. Haft recommended his former professor. Their relationship remained warm -- Robert Haft, at Ms. Malone\\'s invitation, spoke to one of her classes last fall -- though they haven\\'t spoken since she left Dart\\'s board.  The daughter of dress shop owners in Washington, Ms. Malone has been involved in retailing most of her life. Her first job was wrapping Christmas gifts for Raleigh Stores, a closely held chain of clothing stores in the Washington area. Later, she returned to the company as controller.  A certified public accountant and a Harvard-educated MBA, Ms. Malone serves mostly on the audit and finance committees of the boards she has joined. Last year she served on nine boards, including Limited Inc., Campbell Soup Co., Scott Paper Co. and Houghton Mifflin Co.  According to 1986 proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. Malone received more than $93,000 in annual retainers for serving on the boards, plus additional fees of as much as $1,000 each time she attended a meeting. Supermarkets General paid her $13,000, plus $750 per board or committee meeting. As an outside director and member of Dart\\'s audit committee, she earned $12,000. Trak Auto paid her a $10,000 fee.  Ms. Malone says she didn\\'t set out to become a professional director. But she started joining boards at a time when many companies were trying to add women and minorities. \"Over time,\" she says, \"various relationships led to board opportunities.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0067': 'Tax Law Tough On Bad Debts Within Family --- By Sanford L. Jacobs Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> June M. Rodgers, who made a small fortune from fast-food franchises, loaned her new husband, Allen C. Smith, more than $125,000 for his business. He had led her to believe it was worth more than $1 million. She learned the truth some six months later when the vending-machine company stopped operating and put itself into bankruptcy.  She got a divorce -- and nothing from the bankruptcy settlement. So she took a bad-debt deduction on her tax return. But that wasn\\'t the end of her problem: The deduction was challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, on the claim that Ms. Rodgers had actually made a gift to Mr. Smith. Ms. Rodgers took the matter to Tax Court, where she eventually won.  Others claiming such deductions don\\'t always succeed. The IRS frequently challenges people who write off loans to friends, relatives or their own businesses. \"I found it to be one of the major audit triggers on personal tax returns,\" says Bernie D. Goldstein, senior managing partner of Goldstein &amp; Schmerling, a Nashville, Tenn., accounting firm.  If the IRS challenges the deduction, then the taxpayer must prove that a bona fide debt existed, that it became uncollectible and that the write-off was taken in the year that the debt became worthless.  Being soft-hearted can turn a bona fide debt into a nondeductible gift. Deciding against suing a relative, even though he may be able to pay off the debt, means becoming unentitled to a bad-debt deduction, says Alfred B. Greenberg, a partner in Phillips Gold &amp; Co., a New York accounting firm. \"What you have really done is made a gift,\" he says.  To take the deduction, \"you need to be able to show that you made an honest effort to collect the debt,\" says Nancy Anderson, a senior tax-research and training specialist at H &amp; R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. A letter from a lawyer saying that collection efforts would be fruitless, because the debtor is insolvent, usually is proof of a debt\\'s worthlessness.  So is the debtor\\'s filing a bankruptcy petition unless collateral is involved. Then a lender may have to await the outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding to establish that nothing can be recovered on the debt. If a partial recovery is made, the uncollectible amount normally is deductible.  The IRS requires taxpayers who take a bad-debt deduction to attach a statement to their returns listing the amount of debt, when it became due, the names of the debtors and whether they are relatives, plus what efforts were made to collect the money, and when and why the debt became worthless. IRS Publication 548, available free from the IRS, explains the government\\'s position on bad-debt write-offs.  A frequent error that taxpayers make is taking a business bad-debt deduction for a non-business debt. An owner who lends money to his firm\\'s customers to retain their business usually is considered to have business debt, because there was a business motive for the loans.  But an owner who lends money to his own business is generally deemed to make a non-business loan. The IRS sees such loans as protection for the owner\\'s investment, not as part of the business itself -- since he isn\\'t in the loan business.  It is an important distinction. A business bad debt is fully deductible in the year it becomes worthless. But a non-business bad debt is treated as a short-term capital loss, only $3,000 of which can be deducted each year. The excess is carried forward and $3,000 is deductible each year until the amount is exhausted.  A taxpayer who has to make good as the guarantor of someone else\\'s debt isn\\'t necessarily entitled to a bad-debt deduction. If the guarantee was done as a favor for family or friends, the IRS considers it a non-deductible gift. But an owner who makes good on loans he guaranteed for his business normally would be entitled to a non-business bad-debt deduction.  Mr. Goldstein contends that the co-signer of a note can take a non-business bad-debt deduction if he makes good on a note in order to maintain his own credit standing. \"The IRS might argue that you didn\\'t have to pay off the note,\" he says. \"But I would argue that your name is on that note and you couldn\\'t afford to have your reputation impugned at the bank.\"  Attaching to the tax return a letter from the bank demanding payment should help to sustain the deduction, he says.

       " 'WSJ870323-0066': 'AIRLINES (AIR) </IN> Texas Air Corp., moving to consolidate its diverse family of airlines, is facing resistance from employees on a growing number of issues, ranging from wages and work conditions to seniority.  The biggest trouble spot now is Eastern Airlines, where union and management have continued a war of nerves that began when the company last January requested pay cuts averaging 29%. Eastern executives recently met with representatives of the pilots and machinists unions and agreed to continue discussing labor-cost issues without reopening existing contracts.  But no concessions have been volunteered by the unions, which are taking new offensive measures.  Eastern pilots said they plan to put up picket lines in certain cities April 2. The pilots aim to protest not only Eastern\\'s call for wage cuts, but also newly imposed sick-leave rules, which the pilots maintain are in violation of the contract, and Texas Air\\'s transfer of certain Eastern assets, including planes and routes, to Texas Air\\'s nonunion Continental Airlines unit.  The Eastern pilots have also proposed broadening the jurisdiction of their labor contract to pilots at all Texas Air units. Through its Continental Airlines unit, Texas Air also owns People Express, Frontier Airline and New York Air. Eastern executives haven\\'t responded to the proposal, and won\\'t comment on any meetings with union representatives except to confirm that they have occurred.  Eastern\\'s pilots are also holding informal organizing meetings with Continental\\'s nonunion pilots throughout the U.S. But getting Continental\\'s pilots to join a union won\\'t be easy; many of them crossed picket lines during an acrimonious strike at Continental in 1983. \"We know it\\'s going to be tough,\" concedes Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern\\'s pilots union, who is heading the effort to enlist Continental pilots in the union.  Eastern pilot union officials claim their efforts received a major boost last week, when Texas Air announced a possible new seniority plan for pilots. Under the plan, Continental captains would be senior to pilots who were captains at People Express, and all other Continental pilots would be senior to all other pilots who worked for People. This means that Continental pilots will have first crack at better routes and aircraft and access to more favorable layover points and trip lengths. Thus, Eastern union officials view the former People Express pilots as most receptive to efforts to organize the entire force of Continental pilots.  Texas Air\\'s seniority plan will occur only if the corporate structure of People Express is merged with Texas Air, as the operations of People Express already have been. A Continental spokesman said People Express pilots are treated somewhat less favorably only because their prospects for advancement were grim before the troubled company was acquired by Texas Air. Still, a group of pilots already filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court over the proposed seniority plan.  Meanwhile, other Eastern unions are no closer to resolving labor-contract issues raised by Eastern management. Charles Bryan, the president of Eastern\\'s union representing machinists and baggage handlers, termed a recent meeting with management \"an exercise in futility.\" Mr. Bryan said he was particularly angry that the day after the meeting, Eastern announced it was terminating 98 mechanics\\' jobs. The timing of the layoffs, Mr. Bryan asserted, made it appear as if the job slashing had the union\\'s tacit approval. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0065': 'A Tamer Triple Witching Hour Takes Stocks, Futures Prices to Record Highs --- By Beatrice E. Garcia Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFT) </IN> The once-quarterly stock, futures and options trading frenzy that is triple witching hour came again on Friday, bringing stock and futures price records instead of a curse.  Perhaps tempered by experimental regulatory guidelines, it was a bit tamer than its predecessor last Dec. 19. And it left relieved investors daring to hope that Wall Street may finally have learned to cope with the massive program trading activity associated with the simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.  Or was it luck? Indications are that a number of big institutional investors moved to \"unwind\" their combined stock and futures positions well before Friday. Perhaps as a result, New York Stock Exchange volume during the final minute fell far short of predictions.  Following an unnerving swoon shortly after 3:30 p.m. EST, stock prices did run up sharply as final-minute volume totaled 55 million shares -- not much more than half of the final-minute volume Dec. 19. After the close, both Wall Street traders and federal regulators pronounced themselves pleased with how the trading was handled.  \"Certainly, the level of volatility was low and things seemed to be handled smoothly,\" said Richard Ketchum, head of the market regulation for the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"We still have to do an analysis of the microdynamics of the close -- who did what to whom and why,\" said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, but \"I wouldn\\'t call (the experimental regulation) a failure.\"  Peter Borish, vice president of Tudor Investment Corp., said that expirations are \"good because they scare people. You can\\'t have a bull market without people being afraid\" that stocks are poised to drop sharply in price. He predicted that the stock market rally will accelerate \"faster than anybody thinks. The Dow will be at 2550 in the next three weeks\" before an 8% to 10% correction. Then the rally will continue, he said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 2300 for the first time, gaining 33.95 points -- a dozen during the final minute -- to finish at a record 2333.52. In Chicago, the June contract on the Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index soared to a record high of 299.80, up 3.80 for the day.  \"This was the first expiration I\\'ve seen where (investors) weren\\'t sitting on their hands or acting in some unusual way because it was an expiration day,\" said Joseph Schmuckler, a vice president in the financial futures department at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. \"The market is maturing and it was business as usual,\" he added.  But, while it might not mean major new regulation, business as usual will mean continued government scrutiny of program trading activity. Today the commission\\'s Division of Market Regulation is scheduled to release a 43-page study of the hectic trading that drove down the Dow Jones Industrial Average a total of 120 points last Sept. 11 and 12.  That big sell-off wasn\\'t triggered by stock-index futures trading strategies, the study found, but rather by investors\\' perceptions that economic conditions had worsened. However, it adds that \"index-related futures trading was instrumental in the rapid transmission\" of investors\\' bearishness to stock prices \"and may have condensed the time period in which the decline occurred.\"  The study, completed with the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff, concludes that the September plunge alone doesn\\'t suggest any major regulatory or structural changes are needed. But it warns that \"dramatic growth\" in institutional use of index products \"requires continued careful analysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market as well as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in the index products and their component stocks.\"  Big Board member firms\\' apparently strict compliance with experimental SEC and Big Board trading regulations may have helped damp volatility in Friday\\'s session, market professionals said. Under the guidelines, all the firms were to disclose a half-hour before the close all the orders in 50 blue-chip stocks, including all of the Dow Jones 30 industrials, that they planned to fill on the closing bell. (It is the crush of these \"market-on-close\" orders, executed precisely as the futures and options expire, that produces the triple witching hour trading mayhem.)  At the December expiration, not all the market-on-close orders were reported by the 3:30 p.m. deadline. The imbalances in the orders that were entered by them showed there were many more sales than purchases planned for the closing bell. But in the final minute, one firm, reportedly Salomon Brothers Inc., entered an estimated $1 billion to $1.5 billion of buy orders. While the big order forced prices to spurt higher at the bell, it also frightened and angered other market participants that day.  As it turned out Friday, the imbalances in market-on-close orders disseminated on the Big Board transactions tape were heavily on the buy side, precisely the outcome at the close. But it was a tortuous road to the bell.  Friday morning \"every major house was said to have buy orders\" for execution on the close. That was pretty common knowledge before the market opened,\" said Michael Bernstein, a partner with Miller, Tabak, Hirsch &amp; Co., a New York securities firm.  Stock prices started to rise as trading got under way Friday. Airline, drug, oil, technology, and some brokerage firm stocks took off. Trading was active throughout much of the morning but settled down a bit around midday and through much of the afternoon until the final hour.  In the final hour, the anxiously anticipated late buy orders began to flow. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. reported shortly after 3 p.m. that it had blue-chip stock buy orders totaling $1.1 billion.  The noise level in the trading room of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in downtown Manhattan jumped several notches at 3:30 p.m., when traders read and shouted out the already-calculated order imbalances streaming by on the Big Board transactions tape on the firm\\'s intercom system. \"100,000 shares of General Motors to buy,\" shouted one; \"276,000 shares of Du Pont to buy. 200,000 shares of Chevron to buy,\" bellowed another.  Then, second thoughts. \"It\\'s not going to be up that much. I\\'m seeing a lot of brokers with sell orders,\" Dan Marciano, who heads the trading desk at Prudential-Bache, broadcasted to the firm\\'s traders at 3:45 p.m.  \"The whole market had been rallying in anticipation of big buy programs at the close,\" explained Courtney Smith, head of futures trading and research at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York. But once they studied the order imbalances running on the Big Board tape \"people knew that wasn\\'t the case . . . and that led to a sell-off.\"  Indeed, brokers already had found sellers to satisfy many of the buyers as the imbalances were reported. There weren\\'t as many buyers as many professionals had expected, either, and in the first 20 minutes of the final half-hour, the industrial average sank nearly 10 points.  Three minutes before the closing bell, the \"tick\" indicator, which measures the net difference between the total number of stocks trading higher in price from their prior trade and the total of those trading lower than their prior sale, showed a minus 479 issues. But stock prices then seemed to literally turn on a dime and by the time the consolidated tape stopped running some 25 minutes later, the indicator read plus 820.  When the digital clock that hangs above Prudential-Bache\\'s trading desk showed 4 p.m., one trader blew a party horn. Thomas Ponticelli shouted: \"Look at that block tape\" as blocks of more than 10,000 shares of Coca-Cola, International Business Machines, Philip Morris, Ford, Digital Equipment, and many others whizzed by at twice the usual speed.  Most of the fun in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\\'s S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures pit had occurred a bit earlier in the session. When the expiring March contract briefly touched the 300 mark for the first time, traders cheered and tossed cards into the air. \"It\\'s a real high,\" said one. \"It\\'s like you\\'re king of the hill.\"  Most of the other closely watched market barometers also moved to new highs along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday. The S&amp;P-500 stock index finished up 4.09 at 298.17 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.09 to 169.37.  Technology stocks scored big gains. IBM rose 1 5/8 to 148 5/8; NCR added 3 1/4 to 67 3/4; Unisys moved up 1 5/8 to 107 1/2; and Hewlett-Packard advanced 1 to 61 1/4.  Texas Instruments rose 3 1/4 to 175 1/2. Goldman Sachs recommended the stock Friday, but other Wall Street analysts were recommending semiconductor issues to their clients in the past week. Also, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry urged 10 Japanese semiconductor companies not to sell computer chips overseas at unfairly low prices.  American Express fell 1 1/2 to 77 1/4 on more than 2.1 million shares. The financial services concern said it received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents pertaining to transactions in securities of its Fireman\\'s Fund unit and American Express. The subpoenas related to transactions with Jefferies &amp; Co., whose chairman resigned Thursday and plans to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating securities laws. Jefferies moved up 1 3/4 to 12 3/4 and other brokerage stocks also gained.  Amax fell 7/8 to 18 1/8. The company filed an offering of 15.7 million shares.  Computer Sciences jumped 4 3/8 to 58 3/4. The concern said it will negotiate a contract with NASA that the company estimates is valued at $1 billion if NASA exercises all of its options.  Pan Am was unchanged at 4 3/8 in active trading. The financially strapped airline reported a fourth-quarter loss of $197.5 million after charges. The stock\\'s price has been sliding since early January when it traded around 6.  LTV Corp. rose 1/4 to 3 on heavy volume.

       " 'WSJ870323-0064': 'Carrier Trying to Sell Stake, Sources Say --- By Linda Williams Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AIRLINES (AIR) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> For months Air Atlanta Inc. has been flying practically on empty. The next few days may determine whether the small, closely held airline has finally run out of fuel.  It is negotiating to sell as much as a 25% stake to KLM Royal Dutch Air Lines for $10 million, according to sources close to the company. But it may be grounded by a cash shortage before Thursday, when KLM is expected to decide whether to acquire the stake.  The airline stayed afloat last week by selling its slot at Washington National Airport to Pan American World Airways for $2 million. The transaction produced $500,000 in cash, enabling the company to pay enough past-due rent and landing fees to avoid default at Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield International Airport, its hub.  Now executives of the three-year-old carrier are scrambling to obtain a bridge loan that may be needed to tide it over until Thursday. They met last week with representatives of its current investors in an apparently unsuccessful effort to get them to provide additional capital. Air Atlanta\\'s biggest investors include Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and CSX Corp.  Air Atlanta officials said the company may be able to get through the week with cash on hand. Officials declined to comment on the KLM negotiations.  The proposed transaction with KLM would include an agreement to feed Air Atlanta passengers to KLM international flights. Air Atlanta currently has such an agreement with Pan American, flying that carrier\\'s international passengers to and from New York\\'s Kennedy International Airport.  Daniel H. Kolber, Air Atlanta executive vice president, said the company has discussed such agreements with a number of carriers.  But sources said there may be a major regulatory stumbling block to any pact with KLM. They said the U.S. Department of Transportation hasn\\'t been allowing the so-called \"code-sharing\" between international and domestic carriers that KLM may require under the proposed Air Atlanta-KLM arrangement. Code-sharing between airlines involves passengers being booked on connecting flights as though they were being served by one carrier.  Michael R. Hollis, Air Atlanta chairman, is said to be lobbying with the federal agency for a rule change.  The company has attracted attention since its first flight in 1984 because Mr. Hollis, a 33-year-old black entrepreneur, entered a highly visible business without government help.  Air Atlanta has billed itself as an airline created to serve business, attempting to carve a niche with travelers who want such frills as roomier seats, better meals and a gate-side lounge with free drinks, telephones and newspapers.  Considered the best-financed black-led venture ever, Air Atlanta nevertheless was undercapitalized for the current deregulated, competitive airline environment. Unable to produce a profit, the company has had to appeal repeatedly for bailouts from investors. The company currently has about $50 million of debt outstanding, but it is mostly zero coupon convertible notes which don\\'t require interest payments, according to sources. The company\\'s most pressing problem is about $2 million owed to vendors, including the Atlanta airport.  Current investors are balking at providing additional funds in part because they\\'re uncomfortable with the inability of Mr. Hollis to keep a president and chief operating officer at the company, according to a former executive with one of the initial investors. Last month, Harry A. Kimbriel, 59-year-old former American Airlines executive, resigned as president, citing philosophical differences with Mr. Hollis, an attorney without previous airline experience. Investors had insisted that someone be hired to oversee day-to-day operations at the airline.  Mr. Kimbriel has since agreed to continue working at the airline as a consultant.  Despite the airline\\'s problems, company officials say they believe Air Atlanta will get the capital needed to put it on its feet. \"We have a good product,\" Mr. Kolber said. The airline\\'s load factor, or percentage of seats filled, has steadily improved to 53%, he said, despite little advertising and negative publicity.  Air Atlanta has argued that the company can be profitable with 12 to 15 planes; it currently has seven, which are leased. One reason the company is negotiating with potential investors is to provide money to lease additional aircraft. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0063': 'Currency Loss, VW Chief Says --- By Victoria Pope Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen AG, defended the West German auto maker\\'s integrity in the face of a multimillion-dollar foreign-exchange scandal, which occurred despite what he said were strict internal guidelines.  Prosecutors are investigating the alleged fraud, which was uncovered after foreign-currency contracts -- used to protect the company from currency shifts -- came due at the end of 1986. VW has said that the manipulation of its contracts will cost it as much as $259 million. The disclosures have led to the resignation of VW\\'s chief financial officer and the removal of its foreign-exchange manager.  (Despite the foreign-exchange loss, the company\\'s stock price has stabilized after an initial decline.}  Defending VW, Mr. Hahn said that, when he rejoined the company in 1982, \"I asked our internal auditors to draw up a certain set of rules -- of stop-loss orders, of no open overnight positions -- in order to avoid all types of speculation.\" In a stop-loss order, a business gives a bank an order to sell a currency when it reaches a certain level. And if a company has an open overnight position, it is exposed to potential foreign-exchange losses, because commitments to buy a currency aren\\'t balanced by commitments to sell the currency. \"I like to sail, so I\\'m sensitive to winds,\" said the 60-year-old Mr. Hahn. \"We realize we are not necessarily out of the storm, but we realize also that this is not the end of Volkswagen.\"  Mr. Hahn said that the sheer volume of transactions at VW would make it hard to catch irregularities, and that auditors worked for weeks without discovering the forgeries. \"What looks to the public like we were acting late was actually a situation in which we thought we were acting fast,\" the executive said. \"It took us some time to become suspicious.\"  But he expressed optimism that the investigation would produce results. \"The authorities should have access to types of information that cannot be destroyed,\" he said. Data banks at VW were said to have been erased, making the probe more difficult. \"This money has never been carried out of the company in cash, but it must have been transformed at one point into cash,\" he said. \"So from Frankfurt there is possibly a line of bank accounts that will shed more light on this.\"  At VW, which as of today will have made 50 million cars, Mr. Hahn said he is presiding over a successful company whose credibility in the marketplace will be bolstered by its 1986 results. The figures, which are to be released in April, will show \"a good base and good performance\" despite an earnings slowdown, he said.  Volkswagen\\'s pressing projects include setting up a dealer infrastructure for selling models made by the recently acquired Spanish car maker Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo, or SEAT; boosting output at its Brazil operations in the face of mounting economic difficulties in that country; and restoring the image of its upscale Audi in the U.S. following recalls of its 5000 series because of acceleration problems.  Mr. Hahn was optimistic about SEAT, which Volkswagen acquired from the Spanish government in 1986. \"The figures {for 1986} will not be as nice as we would like them, but they will be a dramatic improvement\" over 1985, he said. He predicted that the break-even level will be reached in 1987\\'s second half. Most important, Mr. Hahn said, is securing a much-wanted niche in the lower end of the European market through SEAT.  He said he is concerned about VW\\'s Brazilian business. Despite a traditional position of strength, that operation is in \"very difficult waters\" because of Brazil\\'s monetary and fiscal squeeze, he said.  To combat the effects of a weakened dollar, Mr. Hahn said Volkswagen is shifting export volume to Brazil in the manufacturing sector and using Mexico as a supply base for European manufacturing. The company also is streamlining its U.S. operations through the closure of its Charleston, S.C., plant and the transfer of its U.S.-based sheet-metal operation to Mexico. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0062': 'Using Rote and Math, Wells Fargo Succeeds As a Money Manager --- Now the No. 1 Stock Investor, It Relies on Index Funds; Fears of More Volatility --- Does the Leash Tug The Dog? --- By George Anders Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> On a recent morning, Thomas O\\'Brien bought $25 million of stock-index futures, 225,000 shares of Reebok International Ltd. -- and a bran muffin. Choosing the muffin was the hard part.  Practically everything else in Mr. O\\'Brien\\'s job as chief equity trader at Wells Fargo Investment Advisors is part of a carefully guided process. A computer printout tells him what stocks to buy. A daily scratch sheet tells him when to buy and sell stock-index futures. \"This is great,\" says Mr. O\\'Brien, as he finishes up the futures purchase. \"You can be in and out of the market in five seconds.\"  In money management these days, much of the guesswork, and the glamour, are fading. Now, formulas and percentages, rather than clever hunches about investments, are what count. Largely behind the change are two innovations: stock-index futures markets, which enable traders to buy and sell a contract based on the general level of stock prices, and desk-top computers, which let money managers quickly size up the market according to mathematical models.  At the forefront of this trend toward sophisticated investing is Wells Fargo Investment Advisors.  WFIA\\'s assets have leaped fivefold since 1984. Now managing more than $60 billion for clients, mainly big pension funds, the firm has become the biggest single investor in the stock market. It also is the largest stockholder in dozens of major companies; it owns, for example, more than 10 million shares of International Business Machines Corp., equal to 1.7% of the giant computer company.  The success of this Wells Fargo &amp; Co. investment unit is deceptively simple. WFIA seldom tries to choose between good and bad stocks; instead, it merely matches market benchmarks such as the Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index. \"They just buy a large cross section of stocks for you -- and hold it,\" explains Edward Safran, assistant treasurer of Polaroid Corp. and a major WFIA client.  Yet index funds such as WFIA\\'s have out-performed 60% to 70% of conventional stock managers in recent years. \"Too many active managers pick the wrong stocks or incur high trading costs,\" says Alan Emkin, a pension consultant at Wilshire Associates. \"Index funds just keep tracking the market, and that\\'s very appealing to clients.\"  A bull market such as the current one, of course, favors index funds because they are always fully invested. In contrast, conventional managers usually hold some cash reserves, which have hurt their performance recently. But reserves \"could be a help if the market turns down,\" Mr. Emkin says. \"You can\\'t get out of a falling market if you\\'re in an index fund.\"  At WFIA, there aren\\'t any analysts trying to predict earnings, evaluate new products or forecast the economy. The firm\\'s biggest section is its accounting department, which tracks portfolios, dividends and who owes what to whom. Stock selection is so automatic that WFIA\\'s chief investment officer, 33-year-old Patricia Dunn, keeps a wind-up white robot near her desk. It is an impish present from a colleague, and on its chest is a label saying: \"Investment Manager, Index Variety.\"  Robot investing irks some observers. \"My biggest shareholders don\\'t know who I am, let alone care whether we build a new mill in Alabama,\" complains Andrew Sigler, the chief executive officer of Champion International Corp. \"We\\'re just a computerized stock symbol to them.\" Other critics fret that WFIA\\'s huge use of futures-trading strategies could someday jolt the stock market.  But big clients rush to WFIA\\'s defense. \"They\\'re one of the best in the business,\" says Thomas E. Flanigan, the chief investment officer of the California State Teachers Retirement System. Mr. Flanigan oversees a $20 billion pension plan, which has moved more than $6 billion into the stock market the past few years. \"Indexing is the only approach that lets you move that much money that fast, without hurting yourself,\" he says.  In fact, the value of stock-index funds nationwide has tripled since 1984 to $150 billion, according to consultants. That makes index funds equal to 15% of institutional equity holdings, or about 7% of the entire stock market.  More generally, highly mathematical techniques are becoming crucial to big money managers such as Bankers Trust Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Once in place, their computerized models can pick stocks for years, affected only indirectly by human judgment. Investing is changing from an art to \"a technology-driven, low-cost business,\" says John Casey, a pension consultant.  At WFIA, running the formula last Jan. 30 meant buying more than 200,000 shares of Reebok -- quickly. That\\'s because WFIA likes to own all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index, in amounts scaled to their market weight. Those holdings range from more than $1.4 billion of IBM to just $673,000 of Allis-Chalmers Corp.  But Reebok was added to the S&amp;P index only in early January, and WFIA\\'s main index fund needed to buy about $15 million of stock in the shoe company as fast as it could without driving up the price. Big brokers were glad to help. Mr. O\\'Brien snapped up 100,000 shares in one lot, 125,000 in another. By 10 a.m., he was done.  For all that buying, no one at WFIA really cares how Reebok does. \"There aren\\'t that many mispriced securities anymore,\" Fred Grauer, WFIA\\'s president, says. Each year, random luck brings Wells its share of winners -- and losers. In fact, Mr. Grauer argues that it is better to buy the whole stock market in a way that minimizes commissions and trading costs than to spend a lot of time and money in an often-futile search for \"cheap stocks.\"  Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 index rose a bit more than 18%, with dividends reinvested, WFIA\\'s big index funds were right in line-up 18.49%. \"We can track the index to within 0.01 percentage point,\" Ms. Dunn boasts.  Index funds are just part of WFIA\\'s business, though, and its professionals would rather talk about new products. These include international index funds, a fund that uses computer models to pick promising areas of the stock market, and \"stock-index arbitrage.\"  This kind of arbitrage involves shuffling millions of dollars between stocks and futures, depending on which investment is cheaper at the moment. Last year, WFIA\\'s stock-index arbitrage earned more than $20 million for clients.  Each morning, futures specialists give Mr. O\\'Brien, the trader, a scratch sheet with target prices for when to buy or sell futures. In late January, for example, he was ready to sell S&amp;P futures any time they rose more than 1.10 points above the underlying stock index. If futures fell more than 0.20 point below the stocks, he would buy futures and sell stocks instead. His typical trade involved $30 million.  \"We did eight of these one day,\" Mr. O\\'Brien says. Traders joke that S&amp;P arbitrage is such a sure moneymaker that only nuclear war could disrupt it. In fact, Mr. O\\'Brien\\'s biggest concern the morning of Jan. 30 was that too many other institutions wanted to make the same trades. By the time he was ready to buy futures, three other buyers had jumped ahead of him in brokers\\' queues.  Traditional money managers shudder at this form of trading. \"This is turning the New York Stock Exchange into a commodities crapshoot,\" complains Charles Allmon, the publisher of the Growth Stock Outlook newsletter. \"It\\'s adding volatility and instability to the market.\"  But S&amp;P arbitrage \"simply provides liquidity,\" insists Jeremy Evnine, a WFIA futures specialist. When other traders push futures prices out of line, WFIA steps in to restore the balance, he says. \"To blame us for moving the market is like blaming a leash for tugging a dog. You have to look for the hand at the other end.\"  WFIA is even more active in another computer-driven investment strategy: portfolio insurance. This technique involves owning stocks while hedging the risk of a market drop with stock-index futures. The hedge is adjusted to increase protection in falling markets, while letting investors participate in a bull market.  WFIA invests now $9 billion this way, all from Nancy Feldkircher\\'s terminal. The 26-year-old assistant vice president says: \"I try to think of all that money as just commas and zeros. Otherwise, I get nervous.\"  But Ms. Feldkircher doesn\\'t really make the decisions; she just carries them out. Computer software licensed from Leland O\\'Brien Rubinstein Associates Inc., of Los Angeles, decides when to buy and sell. Ms. Feldkircher\\'s biggest modification was to put an old Mercedes instrument gauge above her terminal. \"It makes it look more high-tech,\" she jokes.  Portfolio-insurance clients seem pleased with WFIA\\'s results so far. \"It\\'s being played just the way I would have expected,\" says Timothy R. Barron, a Virginia investment official.  Nonetheless, some critics worry that portfolio insurance, with its mechanical buying and selling of futures, could someday accelerate a plunge in stock prices. When portfolio insurers rush to sell stock-index futures, their huge sales can depress futures prices relative to stocks. At that point, arbitragers, trying to profit from discrepancies between the two markets, begin buying futures while selling the underlying stocks. These \"sell programs,\" often involving hundreds of different issues, can push stock prices even lower and set off a vicious circle.  The real test will come in a falling market, of course, and lately the market has been strong. However, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 86.61 points last Sept. 11, some arbitragers said they increased their selling that afternoon to get in ahead of portfolio insurers; they expected the insurers to need to sell more futures soon to implement their hedges.  Aware that such tactics could aggravate market plunges, WFIA is trying to use \"a little bit of judgment on portfolio-insurance trading,\" says Rolf Theisen, another WFIA futures specialist. Stock options and cash markets are being used as well as futures, he explains, and traders have discretion to execute an order gradually if futures seem badly mispriced relative to stocks. \"It isn\\'t an emergency situation where people have to trade at all costs,\" he says.  WFIA\\'s current market clout would have seemed unthinkable in the 1960s, when the notion of index funds arose. At that time, finance professors at the University of Chicago argued that individual stock prices moved so randomly that it made more sense to hold a diverse basket of stocks than to try to pick winners. In 1971, pension managers at Samsonite Corp. became convinced enough to ask Wells to set up the first working index fund.  Growth in such investing was slow in the 1970s. But it has taken off in the past few years, as studies going back as much as two decades began showing a clear performance edge for index funds. Previously stubborn pension managers decided that they might as well settle for indexing.  In a critical move in 1983, Wells Fargo hired Mr. Grauer away from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to run its investment unit. He replaced William Fouse, a pioneer in indexing, who left Wells to set up his own indexing firm for Mellon Bank Corp. At that point, says Mr. Casey, the consultant, \"The top management at Wells Fargo finally realized what a good business they had in indexing. That\\'s when they really decided to let it grow.\"  For all its huge portfolios, WFIA itself is surprisingly puny. It employs just 110 people, ensconced on one floor of a San Francisco office tower. Its index-fund management fees are minuscule, ranging as low as 0.05% of assets annually; thus, WFIA\\'s $60 billion of assets probably provides only $30 million to $50 million a year in fee revenue. Its pretax profits are believed to be less than half that and thus well under 5% of Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\\'s overall net income. (Officials won\\'t discuss WFIA\\'s revenue or earnings.)  Still, new money keeps pouring in. In January, for example, WFIA added 15 more clients with $2.6 billion in assets.  \"People keep asking us how big we can get, as if there were some upper limit,\" says Jeff Skelton, WFIA\\'s director of business development. \"They don\\'t realize that size is the friend of the indexer.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0061': '--- Limited Supply of AZT, Access to Treatment Pose Problems in U.S. --- By Marilyn Chase Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Now that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first prescription drug for AIDS, concern is mounting over just how many patients can afford the treatment, and who will pay for it.  The federal agency gave clearance Friday to Burroughs-Wellcome Co., the U.S. unit of London-based Wellcome PLC, to market azidothymidine, or AZT, in the U.S. The drug is for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and its related pneumonia, as well as for severe AIDS-related complex, known as ARC. More than 32,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and 10 times that number are believed to suffer from ARC, a set of symptoms similar to AIDS. The company estimates 15,000 patients in each category will qualify for the drug, which will be marketed under the name Retrovir.  Developed with an urgency that matched the swift and fatal course of the epidemic, AZT prolonged survival for patients in a six-month controlled trial last year. Its major side effects include severe anemia and bone marrow suppression, necessitating blood transfusions or a halt in treatment for one-third to one-half of the AIDS patients on the drug.  Still, \"AZT is a first step that shows how rapidly progress can be made when the government and private sector work together,\" says Samuel Broder of the National Cancer Institute, who administered the first test dose to AIDS patient Joseph Rafuse just 20 months ago. This makes AZT the fastest drug development story since anti-malarial agents were sped to GIs in World War II, he says.  The drug\\'s price -- $8,300 a year wholesale and $10,000 retail -- indicates a hefty $250 million in annual revenue for the company, based on treatment of 30,000 patients. Michael Sorell, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., says he expects the drug will be \"a big profit maker for Wellcome,\" and the market reacted favorably. In London trading Friday, Wellcome shares closed at the equivalent of $7.97, up 62 cents. But the price and revenue figures alarm physicians and consumer advocates around the country.  \"It\\'s expensive. For patients, it\\'s a potential hardship,\" says Lawrence Kaplan, medical director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. Unanswered questions about insurance and Medicaid coverage further cloud the picture, because \"many patients aren\\'t working, and survive on government subsidy,\" explains a spokeswoman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.  \"Only the privileged and rich will be able to handle the cost,\" adds Lionel Resnick, of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami. \"It doesn\\'t take much to realize that we have a very big problem.\"  \"I think the extraordinarily high price of the drug needs to be justified by the company in very clear terms, because it will clearly limit access to patients who could benefit,\" says Jerome Groopman of New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.  But David Barry, vice president for research at Burroughs-Wellcome, says: \"I think it\\'s a fair price. It\\'s a price we had to charge to stay in business.\" The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has committed a total of $80 million in research and development of the drug, including about $10 million in free drug given to nearly 5,000 patients who participated in the clinical trial.  He reiterates that AZT is expensive to make, requiring seven months of work to produce six chemical reactions that result in the drug. The material, thymidine, was once obtained from herring sperm but is now purchased in synthesized form from New York-based Pfizer Corp.  Dr. Barry also argues that because AZT prolongs life and reduces episodes of infection, AIDS patients will require less hospitalization and will be able to return to work. Thus, Burroughs-Wellcome officials figure a potential 25% reduction in the cost of care for patients on AZT, he says.  \"I have no compunction about charging this price,\" Dr. Barry says. \"No one flinches at hundreds of dollars a day in hospital costs, but everyone expects a drug that prevents hospitalization to be much less.\"  But AZT\\'s price places it clearly beyond the reach of the many patients who are indigent or uninsured. About 40% of AIDS patients are on Medicaid or will be, according to the federal Health Care Financing Administration. But not all states pay for prescription drugs under Medicaid; it is their option to offer the benefit. Two states, Alaska and Wyoming, offer no coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid, and Florida, which has the fourth-highest incidence of AIDS, limits prescription drug benefits to $22 a month, according to a staffer of a congressional health committee.  \"It makes for a very ugly situation,\" says Dr. Resnick in Miami. \"I\\'m very frustrated. The government has to take a lead role. We have a lot of poor patients, and I would like to see them on the drug.\"  Moreover, ARC patients have a tougher time qualifying than those with a formal AIDS diagnosis. In California, for example, patients with an AIDS diagnosis receive Medicaid. But San Francisco General\\'s Dr. Kaplan worries: \"It\\'s more difficult for patients with ARC. Some aren\\'t eligible for MediCal (California\\'s Medicaid) at this stage.\" He adds that \"the issue of whether third-party payers or MediCal will be covering (treatment) remains to be resolved. We expect that they will.\"  One physician, who asked not to be named, warns: \"Either it\\'ll be on the taxpayer\\'s back, or patients will be robbing pharmacies . . . . These are desperate, dying patients.\" Some physicians fear illegal trade in the drug will arise.  But federal health officials are anxiously studying the drug\\'s impact on federal health programs. William L. Roper, the financing agency\\'s administrator, estimates Medicaid may spend $50 million on AZT in 1987, and $150 million in 1988.  Burroughs-Wellcome executives recently faced questions on Capitol Hill that ranged from sharp to hostile, when the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment held hearings on the cost of AZT. Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked: \"How did you arrive at a price of $10,000? Why didn\\'t you set it at $100,000?\" T.E. Haigler Jr., Burroughs-Wellcome president, testified that the company\\'s involvement in AZT research \"involved a significant amount of risk.\" He added, \"Because the full usefulness of AZT and the efficacy and speed of introduction of competitive products are unknown, our financial returns are uncertain.\"  Indeed, some physicians and patient advocates hope competition will come soon to force a moderation of AZT\\'s steep price. Other drugs currently are being tested, including interferon, ribavirin, AL-721, isoprinosine, Imreg-1 and GM-CSF.  Some think competition may come from Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., recently designated the government\\'s licensee for the development, testing and possible marketing of DDC, or dideoxycytidine. Hoffmann is the U.S. unit of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., Switzerland. The drug is a sister drug of AZT that scientists at the National Institutes of Health have found more potent in the test tube at lower doses, thus prompting hopes that the drug might work with fewer side effects. But only a handful of patients have received DDC, and despite a preliminary observation that it raised the count of their T-cells -- immune system cells normally ravaged by the virus -- clinical efficacy remains to be proven in larger trials.  The National Cancer Institute also is working on a third related compound, dideoxyadenosine, but hasn\\'t named a commercial licensee. \"In the foreseeable future, it\\'s likely we\\'ll have a number of possible strategies for the treatment of AIDS,\" says NCI\\'s Dr. Broder. \"So at some point, competition may be a real factor in reducing overall costs of anti-viral therapy.\"  But for now, AZT\\'s availability is going to be the chief concern for many patients. Burroughs-Wellcome\\'s Dr. Barry says the company has only enough to provide for 15,000 initially, but expects to supply doses for 30,000 by year\\'s end.  Further, distribution will be tightly allocated under a company program that requires doctors to obtain a form from Burroughs-Wellcome -- by calling 1-800-843-9388 -- and fill out a description of an eligible patient\\'s symptoms. The company then will assign a confidential patient number, and allocate a month\\'s dose to the patient\\'s local pharmacy.  Dr. Groopman in Boston says he is skeptical that pharmaceutical representatives can effectively control retail distribution. Dr. Barry counters that the program \"is actually very streamlined and straightforward.\" But he acknowledges, \"There\\'s always the possibility of fraud.\"  AZT -- by now a textbook case on the serendipity and complexity of drug development -- was created in 1964 by Jerome Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as a possible chemotherapy drug. But it didn\\'t work and was shelved for a decade until acquired by Burroughs-Wellcome as a possible anti-microbial agent. When NCI began mass-screening drugs against the AIDS virus in the test tube, Burroughs-Wellcome became one of about 50 companies and private labs to send in candidate products. A sample of AZT was sent to NCI under the code name \"compound S,\" and in February 1985, scientists identified it as a potent virus killer in the test tube.  Even before the controversy over AZT\\'s cost, its development and testing as an AIDS drug was marked by urgency, intermittent raw-materials shortages and bitter public debate over the second phase of the clinical trial, in which some patients were merely given a sugar-pill placebo. Patient advocates decried the practice, while researchers maintained it was necessary to establish objective proof of the drug\\'s effectiveness.  By midsummer 1986, word leaked that patients on AZT were enjoying longer survival than patients in the control group. An independent monitoring board in September publicly confirmed the striking six-month results: Only one of 145 patients receiving the drug had died, while 19 of 137 patients receiving the placebo had died. The research group then decided to end the controlled experiment, and provided the drug to the placebo group. Since then, 10 other patients in the original AZT group and 16 in the placebo group have died.  The side effects, however, require that doctors \"treat this drug with respect,\" Dr. Broder cautions. Despite the brevity of the clinical trial and concern about side effects, an advisory panel to the FDA met last January and, spurred by the rapid and fatal course of the AIDS epidemic, voted 10-1 to recommend AZT receive full agency approval. Since then, both Britain and France have granted market clearance to the drug.  Notwithstanding its approval, AZT must now submit to continuing tests in groups not covered by the FDA approval: children under 12 with AIDS; patients with Kaposi\\'s Sarcoma, which is an AIDS-linked malignancy; those with AIDS-related neurological disease, and carriers of the virus who show no symptoms. Also planned are studies of its effects in combination with other drugs such as the herpes drug acyclovir, or the immune-system booster interferon. Finally, Burroughs-Wellcome says it plans to fund a clinical trial in Africa, which is where AIDS is believed to have originated. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0060': 'West Virginia Senators Hold Divergent Views Of U.S. Trade Problem --- Byrd Backs Government Role While Rockefeller Wants Firms to Compete Better --- Helping Steel, Hurting Coal --- By Monica Langley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> If West Virginians want to hear two different views of how the nation got into its trade mess and how to get out of it, they need only listen to their two Democratic U.S. senators.  \"It isn\\'t the fault of the Koreans if our kids watch \\'Miami Vice\\' instead of studying math,\" Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV tells a Chamber of Commerce audience in this small Ohio River community. \"We\\'re part of our own problem. American industry can\\'t just keep running to government for relief.\"  But over in nearby Morgantown, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd puts the blame -- as well as the responsibility for protecting basic domestic industries -- squarely on the government. \"By the failure of our government to come to grips with the trade issue, we\\'ve lost thousands of jobs,\" he declares.  These differences underscore the complexity of the trade issue, which has recently emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the major themes of politics in the 1980s and possibly a principal issue in the 1988 elections.  As Congress considers the elements of a major trade package, it must grapple with the same question facing West Virginians as they listen to their two senators: whether to seek quotas, tariffs and other forms of import limits or to adopt a more limited approach that primarily seeks to increase U.S. competitiveness and exports.  Majority Leader Byrd takes a hard-line view, calling for quick action by Congress to protect import-battered industries like steel, textiles and shoes. Mr. Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who speaks Japanese and is an avid internationalist, calls on American business to \"be smarter.\"  Volker Jung, the president of Siemens Public Switching Systems Inc., a unit of Siemens AG, recently met with each lawmaker on trade issues. Sen. Rockefeller, he recalls, immediately began asking detailed questions about the differences between the U.S. and West German educational systems; Sen. Byrd focused on the loss of American jobs and \"wanted to know what are Siemens\\'s goals in the U.S.\"  Adds Gary White, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association: \"Rockefeller tells us to make sacrifices to make our coal exports more competitive. . . . Byrd says he wants to protect basic industries and see that they keep their fair share of the domestic market.\"  The trade issue is crucial to West Virginians -- but it cuts in several directions. The state\\'s major industry, mining, has been severely depressed for years; in steel, petrochemicals and glass, job losses to foreign competition have been high. But surprisingly, some 20% of what West Virginia produces is sold abroad -- far more than the 12% or so in the nation as a whole.  Both of West Virginia\\'s senators are integrally involved in the congressional debate on trade. As the majority leader explains it, Sen. Rockefeller, who was just appointed to the Finance Committee, \"is in a good position from inside to help mold the legislation. I\\'m the catalyst to put it all together.\" Moreover, both agree that trade legislation is necessary, and they articulate the same general goals for their state; for example, both believe that the biggest hope for the state\\'s future lies in high technology. \"We probably do bring somewhat different perspectives to the trade issue, but our goal is the same -- to make this country more competitive and to strengthen the economy of West Virginia,\" Sen. Byrd says.  When talk turns specific, the dissimilarities in their backgrounds, viewpoints and solutions begin to emerge. \"We\\'ve had different experiences,\" says Sen. Rockefeller. \"The different experiences mean we talk about trade in a different way.\"  Mr. Byrd, 69 years old, is a product of rural West Virginia. Raised by relatives after his mother died, he worked for 12 years to save enough money to go to college. His position as leader of the Senate\\'s Democrats has made him a national figure, but he still identifies with the state\\'s rural, largely unsophisticated populace. In depressed West Virginia, a job is a precious commodity, and the notion that trade is depriving people of jobs powerfully shapes Mr. Byrd\\'s attitudes.  On a midweek visit to the state, the majority leader stops for coffee in Flatwoods, a town of 400 people along Interstate 79, smack in the middle of the state. The owner of the local truck stop tells Mr. Byrd about a nearby mill that has lost its market for barrel staves and blames the loss on unfair trading practices by foreign countries. In response, the senator talks about the need for tough trade legislation to \"make the country competitive again.\"  The next day, Mr. Byrd is the host at a well-attended conference promoting the development of a \"Software Valley\" in the state to be modeled after California\\'s Silicon Valley. The majority leader is trying to persuade computer giants to set up shop in the state or contribute technology to help basic industries in West Virginia modernize and become more competitive.  By the end of the daylong event, the senator has obtained commitments from several companies to help in the project. Bell Atlantic Corp. decides to locate its new software-development center in West Virginia, and International Business Machines Corp. agrees to lend an executive to run the project.  Sen. Byrd\\'s push for a Software Valley is consistent with his tendency to worry first about how domestic companies are surviving and then look for solutions from the U.S. government and the business community. Sen. Rockefeller, on the other hand, promptly starts out looking to other countries\\' practices and industries for models of what to do to improve the trade picture here.  A scion of one of the wealthiest families in the country, the 49-year-old Mr. Rockefeller has traveled the world extensively and lived for three years in Japan. He first moved to West Virginia as an anti-poverty worker, then decided to stay and start a political career, eventually serving two terms as governor.  Not surprisingly, Sen. Rockefeller has often looked to Japan for solutions to West Virginia\\'s economic problems. He was instrumental in bringing Japan\\'s sixth-largest steelmaker, Nisshin Steel Co., to the state; Nisshin is just breaking ground on a $65 million plant, a joint venture with the beleaguered Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. that will bring at least 100 jobs. At a lunch kicking off the joint venture, the senator gives a Japanese official a U.S. flag that once flew over the Capitol. To cheers, he has the Japanese executive hold up the flag with him.  \"Most of us have an upbeat feeling about\" the joint venture, says Elaine McAlpine, the craft director of the Brooke County Senior Citizen Center, who has a colorful, oversized Japanese calendar tacked up behind her desk. \"It\\'s a chance to get some improvement here.\"  Even some workers who believe that they have been harmed by foreign companies look to the companies for help. Robert McMakin, a coal worker who was laid off in 1983, brings his resume to Sen. Rockefeller at a town meeting in the Fairmont public library, hoping to learn of potential jobs. \"I\\'m willing to work for a foreign company,\" says the father of two. \"I have a feeling the foreign companies put me out of work, and if they come into this country and pay Americans a fair wage so we can feed our families, I\\'m for it.\"  Other voters reflect the divisions between their two senators. At another town meeting at the library in McMechen, south of Wheeling, an overflow audience of steelworkers, retirees and others crowds among the bookshelves to voice its fears. Sentiment is strong for some form of protection against imports. \"When you say we\\'re in a world market, it\\'s an unfair market that is putting our people out of work,\" James Bosworth tells the senator. \"Maybe we should build a wall around ourselves.\" A woman in the audience calls out: \"Let\\'s have a Boston tea party and throw all the Japanese products in the ocean!\"  But other voters think the issue is more complex. \"If you become too protectionist, you cut your nose off to spite your face,\" says Charles Beall, the secretary-treasurer of a Wellsburg lumber company. \"It could help steel, but it would hurt coal because they have to sell out of the country.\"  The only thing all voters seem to agree on is that something must be done. Wherever either senator goes in the state, he is besieged about the issue. \"I\\'ve heard at least five times about rumors of layoffs,\" Sen. Rockefeller says. \"So even if they have a job, they aren\\'t secure.\"  Sen.

Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> A U.S. court extended an order freezing the assets of an Israeli financier and a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executive charged with a $4 million insider-trading scheme. But the SEC said the financier, David Sofer, has indicated he will fight the SEC over control of his overseas assets.  The SEC also disclosed in a memorandum filed at a court hearing Friday that its charges against Mr. Sofer and Nahum Vaskevitch, the former Merrill official, were filed March 11 in an \"emergency\" atmosphere because the SEC believed that Mr. Sofer was trying to move some of his allegedly illicit profits out of the U.S. to Switzerland.  The statement that Mr. Sofer may fight the SEC overseas, also made at the hearing, marked the first indication of any response in the case from Mr. Sofer or Mr. Vaskevitch, Merrill Lynch\\'s former head of mergers in London. Both have been unreachable for comment and their lawyers have declined to discuss the case.  The SEC alleged that Mr. Sofer and Mr. Vaskevitch reaped more than $4 million from insider trading over the past three years, based on tips from Mr. Vaskevitch about deals involving Merrill Lynch clients.  The SEC memorandum alleged that Mr. Sofer unsuccessfully tried to transfer to Switzerland about $500,000 from a brokerage account in which he allegedly made insider trades. Earlier this year, Mr. Sofer transferred about $1.9 million from the brokerage account to a Swiss Bank, the SEC charged.  Thomas C. Newkirk, an SEC lawyer, said Mr. Sofer\\'s lawyer in New York has indicated that Mr. Sofer plans to fight for control of his assets overseas, where the U.S. court\\'s freeze order might not be enforceable. Mr. Sofer hasn\\'t decided whether to contest the U.S. court over his U.S. assets, Mr. Newkirk said. The SEC has declined to disclose the amount of Mr. Sofer\\'s and Mr. Vaskevitch\\'s assets.  Mr. Sofer\\'s lawyer, Stanley Arkin, declined to comment.  The SEC is seeking penalties in the insider trading case of as much as three times the alleged illicit profit, or a maximum penalty of more than $12 million. If the defendants\\' assets in the U.S. are not sufficient, the stage could be set for a fight to seize assets in foreign countries such as Switzerland.  Friday\\'s 10-day extension of the asset freeze was made by Judge Robert W. Sweet. Judge Sweet said the extension would give him time to review the SEC\\'s request for a longer-term preliminary injunction against Mr. Vaskevitch and Mr. Sofer. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0058': 'And Dims U.S. Hopes on Trade Deficit --- By Thomas F. O\\'Boyle Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> A year ago, economists were predicting a West German boom that would propel West Europe to its best economic performance since the 1970s. It never materialized and today, Europe\\'s economic engine is running out of steam.  No one is forecasting a recession in Germany. But it is likely that its economy won\\'t expand this year at even the modest 2% rate forecast only a few months ago -- and that it will actually decline in the current quarter.  The slowdown is casting a shadow over the globe. Germany accounts for one-fourth of the output of the 12-nation European Community, so its weakness is sapping the continent of economic vitality.  Despite strength in Britain and Italy, Common Market growth is expected to sag to 2% this year from the 3.5% annual rate in 1986\\'s second half. The sluggishness is depriving the U.S. of the surge in European imports it needs to narrow its trade deficit, and is dimming hopes for an easing of the world debt crisis.  The Reagan administration is still urging Bonn to revive its economy. It argues that because Germany has the smallest budget deficits, the lowest inflation and the largest economy in Europe, it is in the best position to stimulate growth.  The Germans have agreed to add about $3 billion to an existing $5 billion tax-cut package, which takes effect next January. But so far they haven\\'t shown any inclination to take the stronger action demanded by Washington and some European trading partners.  Yet evidence is mounting that Europe\\'s economic motor has fallen out of the car. The Bundesbank recently reported, for example, that domestic manufacturing orders fell an unusually sharp 4% in January from the previous month.  \"The latest signs are quite disturbing,\" says Klaus Friedrich, an economist specializing in German affairs at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. He adds that the \"weakness is from a base that was already meager.\"  Economist J. Paul Horne of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in Paris, finds the evidence equally troubling. \"The West German economy is very vulnerable,\" he says. If the Germans \"let things go as they are, then a further weakening of the dollar could move them dangerously toward zero growth.\"  Instead of \"dithering,\" Mr. Horne adds, \"the German government would be well advised to step on the gas a little bit.\"  Germany\\'s inflation-adjusted growth of 2.4% last year was its worst showing since the economy climbed out of recession in 1983. Experts project a slack 1%-to-2% gain for all of 1987 -- and a contraction of as much as 1% in the first quarter.  Initially, they had figured that domestic demand, benefiting from lower oil prices, would fill the economic void left by diminishing exports. That happened, to some extent. But what the economists didn\\'t foresee was the precipitous decline in the dollar and the dramatic impact that would have on the German economy. Because Germany depends on exports for one-third of its economy, the impact of a slowdown in trade is profound. Export volume grew less than 1% last year, compared with a 6% increase in 1985.  As exports shrivel, German businesses are becoming pessimistic and cautious, lowering production and inventories.  German business is also scaling back investment, which until recently had reached record levels. Capital spending by German firms this year is expected to run only slightly ahead of 1986 levels, after gains of 9% in 1985 and 5% last year. \"German exporters have stopped buying capital goods,\" says the Fed\\'s Mr. Friedrich.  Some big companies anticipate outright declines. Siemens AG, the electronics giant that makes half of its $25 billion annual sales outside Germany, says it intends to cut capital outlays about 3% this year. The decision follows three years in which annual spending more than tripled to $3.4 billion.  \"Things are slowing down,\" says one Siemens official. \"The business climate just isn\\'t as favorable as it was.\"  His sentiment is widespread. Last month IFO, the Munich-based economic research institute, recorded its steepest decline in German business confidence in more than three years.  Germany\\'s manufacturing sector also faces possible labor unrest. Bargaining with IG Metall, the powerful union that represents more than three million workers in the automobile and metal-working industries, is expected to be contentious as negotiators work to reach a new contract in the next few months. The union\\'s walkout in 1984 crippled the West German economy.  But the biggest potential shock could come from further weakness in the dollar. The U.S. currency has firmed since the meeting of finance ministers in Paris last month and is trading in a narrow range of about 1.85 marks. The threat of central bank intervention could prevent sharp deviation from that level.  If the dollar doesn\\'t remain stable -- if it weakens to 1.75 marks or even lower -- trade would contract even further and a recession might then become imminent, economists fear.  The strong mark, meanwhile, is a double-edged detriment to the German economy: Not only does it make German exports more expensive, it also forces some businesses to expand activities outside Germany, where costs are lower.  Ford of Europe Inc., for instance, is building new engines at its plant in Britain rather than sticking with plans to make them at a factory in Germany. The 26% appreciation of the mark against the British pound in the past two years means that British production offers a $50, or 10%, cost advantage on each engine.  \"Britain is definitely more competitive,\" says William Hayden, Ford\\'s vice president of manufacturing, who expects the current relationship between the pound and the mark to hold for a few years.

The bureau said the number of housing units in the country will reach 100 million by the end of March. John Keane, the bureau\\'s director, called that \"a record of historical significance.\" But in a separate report, the bureau noted that housing costs have risen faster in the 1980s, contributing to a drop in the rate of home ownership over the past six years.  The bureau said the consumer price index rose 17% during 1980-1983, while monthly housing costs rose 26% for homeowners with mortgages and 27% for homeowners without mortgages. Renters fared even worse: The cost of rent and utilities rose 31% in the early 1980s. During 1980-1983, the median value of owner-occupied housing units increased 16% and the sales price of new homes increased 17%.  The decline in the home-ownership rate during the 1980s has been the first drop since the Census Bureau began tracking such figures in 1940. From the 1980 peak of 65.8%, the percentage of units owned or partially owned by at least one occupant fell to a low of 63.5% in the last quarter of 1985. In the last quarter of 1986 the homeownership rate was 63.9%, but census officials said the increase may not be statistically significant.  Arthur F. Young, director of the bureau\\'s housing division, said the home-ownership rate increased just 2.5 percentage points during the 20 years between the 1960 and 1980 censuses. \"What has happened in the last six years since 1980 has been a faster falloff than the increase in the previous 20 years,\" he said.  Mr. Young pointed to the 1981-82 recession and high interest rates, as well as increased home prices, as reasons for the decline in home ownership.  \"There is a lot of housing out there,\" Mr. Young said. \"The real problem is whether the price fits the market.\"  The bureau said the South has led the nation in housing starts since the agency began tracking such information. Housing units tracked by the survey include apartments, mobile homes, and vacation homes, as well as single-family homes. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0053': 'Spinning Off New Editions of Good Book --- By Dale D. Buss Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PUBLISHING (PUB) MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) </IN> For a moment, the TV commercial could pass for a Miller Lite advertisement. Bubba Smith sits under a tree, reading. Dick Butkus approaches, toting a football.  But this time the burly former football players aren\\'t pushing beer; they\\'re selling Bibles. And soon a curious Mr. Butkus snatches one, called \"The Book,\" from Mr. Smith and begins poring through it.  Celebrity testimonials, long a staple in selling more secular products, are just part of a recent move by Bible publishers to use modern marketing techniques. Like merchandisers of soap, cereal and automobiles, Bible companies are concocting slick packaging, going after demographic niches and spinning off new products.  \"They\\'re now using the Harvard Business School approach to marketing, sometimes in very sophisticated ways,\" says John Dessauer, the director of a center for book-industry research at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. \"There\\'s a big change in philosophy.\" And it is producing major changes in the $200-million-a-year retail market for Bibles.  As a nearly 2,000-year-old product -- and a book that tells a well-known story -- the Bible presents an unusual marketing challenge. For centuries, the approach focused on fresh translations -- more than 100 in English alone since about 1900 -- along with, of course, the Bible\\'s continuing appeal to the faithful. Even in the modern era, publishers primarily tapped more-or-less captive markets, with half their sales made to churches and other quantity buyers. But publishers were relatively passive toward individual consumers.  With a rise in visibility of born-again Christianity, total Bible sales grew 10% or more annually from the late 1970s through 1983; annual sales included an estimated 15 million commercial copies by 1984. The conservative-Christianity movement also helped bring a new breed of marketer to religious publishing.  Bruce Ryskamp, the president of the Bible group of Zondervan Corp., a Grand Rapids, Mich., publisher, for example, had been a marketing executive for a Yellow Pages publisher. He says he decided in 1983 to work for Zondervan because \"I really think God was speaking to me.\"  \"Things have changed,\" says Robert Schwalb, vice president of Bible marketing for Thomas Nelson Publishers Inc. of Nashville, Tenn. \"For a long time the church had branded certain professions \\'anti-God,\\' and advertising probably ranked right up there with pornography.\" Now, even such established publishers as Nelson are taking a new approach.  One of the leaders of the marketing vanguard has been Marion G. \"Pat\" Robertson\\'s Christian Broadcasting Network Inc., based in Virginia Beach, Va. In 1984 CBN teamed up with Tyndale House Publishers of Wheaton, Ill., to make a radical change in Bible marketing. \"We looked at it as a consumer product,\" says David Clark, the marketing vice president of CBN. \"What would it take to get people to pick this up?\"  To find out, the partners conducted consumer focus groups and surveyed mall shoppers -- and the results led to a repackaging of Tyndale\\'s mainstay edition. They first picked an intriguingly vague title: \"The Book.\" They made it a paperback and picked a bold cover, after testing six. At $9.95, the price was held below what what they considered the psychologically crucial $10 barrier.  They distributed \"The Book\" through unconventional outlets -- including K marts, hardware stores and groceries -- using catchy displays. They lined up a New York advertising agency, prime television time and celebrity endorsements. The result: More than two million copies have been sold to date, and Tyndale\\'s share of retail Bible sales now is estimated at 12.5%, up from 11% in 1983.  Now that sales of \"The Book\" are cooling off, Tyndale is trying to sustain its success with spinoffs. They include a \"one-year edition\" organized into daily chunks of reading; a children\\'s version that has sold more than 650,000 copies; a religious board game along the lines of Trivial Pursuit, and \"The Book\" on cassette tapes. And last fall, Tyndale introduced \"The Story: From Adam to Armageddon,\" a chronological version.  While perhaps less ambitiously evangelical than CBN\\'s project, Zondervan\\'s efforts are elaborate. By the early 1980s, the company\\'s readable yet literal-minded New International Version was enjoying ecumenical appeal. But it took a niche-marketing approach, led by Mr. Ryskamp, to make sales boom.  Mr. Ryskamp has introduced more than two dozen different splinter editions, helping raise Zondervan\\'s Bible sales to more than $21 million last year, from $11.6 million in 1982. The NIV\\'s share of retail Bible sales has risen to some 30% -- for the first time eclipsing, on a current basis, the venerable King James Version, a public-domain translation put out by several concerns.  Zondervan has targeted, among other segments, the Missouri Synod of Lutherans, with an edition featuring doctrinal notes; scholars, with five study editions; and schoolchildren, with an edition bound ruggedly like a textbook and printed in sans-serif type.  Now Mr. Ryskamp is pondering a large-print edition, in five volumes for easy handling; the book might carry added advice about death, illness, inheritance and other topics of interest to the elderly. Other possibilities: a Spanish-and-English edition aimed at Hispanic immigrants, and one for blacks, perhaps with \"black-English\" references.  Faced with the innovative competition and an overall flat market since 1984, Nelson, the biggest U.S. religious publisher, lost market share and now is trying to recover ground. Its \"Precious Moments Bible,\" illustrated with a popular line of cherubic children\\'s characters, has sold more than a million copies in about a year.  Still, not all marketing strategies deliver. A spokesman for Reader\\'s Digest Association Inc. says the Pleasantville, N.Y., publisher is \"generally pleased\" with sales of more than 500,000 copies of its condensed edition, introduced in 1982. But others maintain that the book hasn\\'t materialized as the significant competitor it was expected to be.  And in their rush to create new versions, the publishers still arouse controversy. Some have gotten themselves into a theological thicket over the Apocrypha, for example, a group of books in the Roman Catholic Bible that Protestants don\\'t recognize. Zondervan, from a fundamentalist Protestant heritage, is hesitant about an NIV translation of the Apocrypha. But Nelson is pursuing the Catholic market with editions that include it -- prompting criticism from some members of the larger Protestant market.  More troubling to publishers -- many of whom have evangelical as well as commercial motives -- are indications of a different problem: Despite the sales efforts, the number of regular Bible readers may be slipping. A Gallup survey this year found that only 11% of the respondents had said they read the Bible daily, compared with 15% in a 1982 survey. Says Mr. Ryskamp: \"All we can do is get the Bible to them. After that, it\\'s in God\\'s hands.\" ',\n",

McIvor, an Exxon senior vice president, said that the world is consuming about twice as much petroleum as is being found and that almost all the world\\'s excess oil-producing capacity, estimated at 20%, lies in the Middle East. \"Unless huge new discoveries are made -- an unlikely event in my view -- we\\'re going to become increasingly dependent on the large remaining reserves of a few Middle East countries,\" he said.  Mr. McIvor\\'s comments were the first definitive declaration that the world\\'s largest oil company expects a significant recovery in oil prices. Responsible for Exxon\\'s world-wide exploration and development activities, Mr. McIvor was to deliver the speech in Queensland, Australia, Monday morning (yesterday at 7:30 p.m. EST) but was unable to because of schedule changes. His comments were delivered instead by Stuart R. McGill, chairman of Esso Australia Ltd., an unit of New York-based Exxon.  As previously reported, Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon\\'s chairman, and Lee R. Raymond, president, said that Exxon\\'s internal planning is based on the price of oil staying relatively flat -- in real terms -- for a few years and then rising faster than the rate of inflation. Though Mr. McIvor wasn\\'t specific on the timing, he did stress in his speech that \"it seems inevitable that the price of oil must rise significantly again before too long.\"  Mr. McIvor noted that the world has been using oil at rates of 20 billion to 25 billion barrels a year since 1970, while discoveries have been accumulating at only 10 billion to 15 billion barrels a year. \"This means that, to a significant degree, we\\'re using up the inventory found prior to 1970 at an increasing rate,\" he said.  Although 30,000 oil fields have been discovered in the world to date, Mr. McIvor said, 35% of all the oil ever found is in just 37 fields, and all but 11 of these \"super giants\" are in the Middle East. Moreover, he said, only five super-giant fields have been found in the past 20 years, and only two of these -- Prudhoe Bay in the U.S. and Cantarell in Mexico -- are outside the Middle East. \"As supply and demand come closer together, as they must do at some point, the world\\'s spare capacity is going to be in a very few countries,\" he said.  Mr. McIvor stressed that he isn\\'t dismissing continued oil exploration as fruitless. He cited \"definite potential\" for economic exploration and development of oil outside the Middle East. \"Valuable discoveries continue to be made each year in scores of countries around the world,\" he said. Nonetheless, he said, \"most major consuming countries, including those with substantial production of their own, will ultimately come to depend heavily on Middle East oil.\"  Exxon is more sanguine on the outlook for world-wide natural gas supplies. Natural gas \"will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the world\\'s energy supply,\" Mr. McIvor said. And as oil prices rise, he added, nonconventional sources such as shale oil and the conversion of natural gas and coal to synthetic oil will become important. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0049': '--- Egyptian President Promises Fair Vote, But Opposition Still Grumbles --- By Gerald F. Seib Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> A journalist recently asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak how he would like to be known among his people. He replied that, above all, he wanted to be known as \"a head of state who truly believes in democracy.\"  The burly, plain-spoken Mr. Mubarak often waxes eloquent about his desire to give Egypt true democracy. Now, 1987 is shaping up as the year when he has to back up his words with action. Mr. Mubarak already has liberalized Egypt\\'s election laws, scheduled elections for the national legislature and begun laying the groundwork for his own reelection to a second six-year term as president. All this maneuvering, political observers agree, is designed to win an undisputed electoral mandate that will allow him to rule decisively in the tough economic times that lie ahead for Egypt.  But in a country with a history of sham elections, vote rigging and near-dictatorial rule by the president, many are skeptical that Mr. Mubarak will give Egyptians a truly free voice. Opposition politicians already are grumbling about the new election law, which sets rules for the April 6 national-legislative elections. They assert that the law, while fairer than the one it replaced, still is written to ensure that Mr. Mubarak\\'s ruling National Democratic Party remains in control of the legislature, known as the People\\'s Assembly.  Despite Mr. Mubarak\\'s moves to open up Egypt\\'s political system, he and his ruling National Democratic Party still hold nearly all the power. The president, a former air force general with strong ties to the military, makes foreign policy decisions with little interference. The 458-seat People\\'s Assembly does debate and pass laws affecting domestic policy. But it is tame by Western standards and clearly run by the ruling party, which holds 389 of the seats.  There are four small opposition parties, ranging from the conservative Wafd to the leftist Progressive Unionist Grouping. They are noisy but have little clout, and only three of them are represented in the assembly. Still, serious political campaigning is under way by the ruling party as well as the opposition. Hundreds of handpainted campaign banners flutter in the Cairo breeze, candidates barnstorm the countryside and Islamic groups hold street rallies for their candidates.  The election is important mostly because the new assembly will nominate a single candidate for president when Mr. Mubarak\\'s term expires in October. The nominee then will have to be approved in a national referendum.  The assembly almost certainly will nominate Mr. Mubarak if he wants to run again. While the president\\'s supporters once thought he mightn\\'t accept another term, they now say the flurry of political activity proves he wants to be reelected.  Mr. Mubarak seems deeply concerned that his reelection appear fair and legitimate. He apparently is bargaining that the public will consider the new People\\'s Assembly to have been fairly elected, so a cloud of illegitimacy won\\'t hang over his head when the assembly nominates him for reelection.  \"He is keen to be nominated by a constitutional body,\" explains Mohammed Sid-Ahmed, a writer and prominent figure in the leftist Progressive Unionist Grouping party. \"The coming period is a very critical economic period. He wants the central authority to be solid.\"  Mr. Mubarak, who took office when Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981, maintains that the development of democracy will keep Egypt stable at a time when low oil prices, fewer jobs for Egyptians in the Persian Gulf and galloping population growth are unsettling the economic climate. He also believes that the development of democracy in Egypt, the most populous Arab nation and a traditional leader in the region, will affect the entire Middle East.  Mr. Mubarak already has allowed opposition political parties to operate freely and to publish newspapers that often are harshly critical of the government. He also allowed relatively free campaigning for the previous People\\'s Assembly election in 1984 -- though charges of vote-rigging arose after the ruling party won 73% of the seats.  Opposition politicians have sought in Egyptian courts to have the law under which the People\\'s Assembly was elected in 1984 declared unconstitutional. They say that because the law required all candidates to belong to political parties, independents were effectively banned. Instead of fighting back in the courts, Mr. Mubarak issued a decree Feb. 4 dissolving the existing People\\'s Assembly and scheduling elections under a new law allowing independent candidates.  But opposition parties still aren\\'t happy because, while independent candidates are free to run, the new law still says that parties must win at least 8% of the national vote to get any seats in the legislature.  This threshold makes it difficult for the country\\'s small opposition parties to win any seats at all. Only the conservative Wafd opposition party won more than the required 8% in the 1984 election, and it took 59 seats. Two other opposition parties are represented in the People\\'s Assembly, but only because President Mubarak, in a goodwill gesture, appointed five of their members. He also appointed five other legislators from minority groups, increasing total membership in the assembly to 458.  Opposition politicians also are clamoring for direct presidential elections, rather than a referendum that simply approves a candidate chosen by the legislature.  Above all, opposition politicians simply doubt that the bureauracy will allow a fair vote even if President Mubarak says he wants one. They say government functionaries in towns and villages consider it their duty to protect the president and his officials, so they pressure citizens to vote for the ruling party. And opposition leaders charge that the Interior Ministry, which oversees elections, regularly inflates the vote for the ruling party.  There isn\\'t much chance Mr. Mubarak can really lose from his election gambit. His party so dominates the scene that it surely will attract far more support than any other, regardless of how fair the vote counting is. But Mr. Mubarak\\'s rhetoric about democracy will lose credibility if the vote appears unfair.  Despite their grumbling and the long odds, opposition politicians are remaining in the campaign. Some even are trying to improve their chances by combining forces. The small Labor and Liberal parties have allied with the Moslem Brotherhood, an Islamic political organization that is legally barred from forming a party of its own.  Formation of this alliance has meant that the demands of Islamic fundamentalists, particularly their insistence that Egypt adopt a strict Islamic legal code, have become part of the campaign. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0048': 'Guggenheim Plan Is Wrong for Wright --- By Manuela Hoelterhoff</HL> If the Guggenheim Museum tinkered with art the way it does with Frank Lloyd Wright\\'s building, nobody would give it any. Wright\\'s dynamic 1959 masterwork, his only building in New York, is arguably the most interesting sculpture the museum has. Already, in 1968, the museum attached to its northern side an ugly, lozenge-decorated annex. Only a few years later, museum officials inserted a bookstore and restaurant into the ground floor of the smaller rotunda. Filling in this open area under the spiral drastically reduced the museum\\'s swirl and swagger.  It\\'s not an architectural record inspiring any confidence, but now the museum, still under the same director, Thomas Messer, is proposing another, much-larger addition to Wright\\'s building. Having withdrawn an earlier design, the museum has a revised plan by the same architecture firm, Gwathmey Siegel, speeding through city channels. Not an inch of it suggests any new recognition on the museum\\'s part of the uniqueness of a building to which it now hopes to affix a mediocre and unnecessary addition by maneuvering its way around zoning regulations.  This all-consuming effort to alleviate a self-inflicted space crunch (why did the museum accept thousands of art works it knew could never be exhibited?) began last year with the museum\\'s first proposal for a 162-foot-high, cantilevered and tiled box over the smaller rotunda. Many meetings, press conferences and hearings later, the museum thought better of it. \"We came to feel we would be well-advised not to press our suit too far,\" said Mr. Messer explaining this decision as he simultaneously introduced the new design earlier this January.  Was that ever a sound feeling -- and a clever move. No seismograph was necessary to sense that the Board of Standards and Appeals -- whose approval the museum needs for its zoning variances -- thought the first proposal as preposterous as the presentation. Are you saying Wright\\'s building is \"functionally obsolete\" and no longer suited \"for the full and expanded mission of the Guggenheim?\" asked the caustic head of the BSA, Sylvia Deutsch. She had just endured the museum director\\'s anguished litany of what a big bother Wright\\'s building was to operate. And she had witnessed an endless parade of backslapping, artspeak-spouting museumniks, who all proved as embarrassing for the museum\\'s cause as the proposed addition\\'s startling resemblance to a flush toilet.  A fit of creativity has now replaced this curiosity with an outsized filing cabinet. Meant for insertion behind the museum, this 133-foot-high limestone-clad structure uses the foundations of the annex that will be torn down. It\\'s an improvement over the first proposal, all right, but that\\'s not saying very much at all. This addition isn\\'t really architecture; it\\'s strategy. While seeming humble, and cutting a few feet here and a few inches there, the museum is still doing exactly what it shouldn\\'t and needn\\'t be doing: planning to mess with a 20th-century monument.  Currently, there\\'s still some air around Wright\\'s museum. Nothing interferes with the big rotunda\\'s dimensional presence. Putting a slab partly behind it not only dwarfs the entire museum, it anchors the rotunda and eliminates the upward sweep and flow of the arc.  The addition doesn\\'t, of course, need to be this high. The slab\\'s top is filled with offices, which the museum refuses to relocate up the block where real estate has been readily available. Neither has it seriously explored going underground for space. At a recent hearing, architect Charles Gwathmey made excavating two floors sound as difficult as drilling a hole to China. His view contrasts with that of excavation specialist Mel Febesh. \"We do this kind of work every day. Safely,\" says Mr. Febesh, president of Urban Substructures Inc., which was hired by Guggenheim Neighbors, a group opposing the slab. In terms of space and cost, an underground vault compares favorably with above-ground construction.  So this obsession with wing-building only makes any sense if one realizes that it is an essential element in landing 10 canvases by impressionist and modern masters belonging to Mrs. Justin Thannhauser, whose late husband is already memorialized in the museum\\'s permanent collection. Museum officials won\\'t disclose details of the proposed bequest, but you can bet that the new addition will be emblazoned with the Thannhauser name, in another example of the death-defying egotism that already haunts so many museums.  Perhaps more information will be divulged when the museum pleads its bogus case in front of the BSA next month. Its chances are better than before, with the museum\\'s tactic of proposing something so horrible and then kindly substituting something less offensive, reducing a few critics to slobbering gratitude. Ms. Deutsch, whose acute questions at last year\\'s hearings sent the museum into appalled huddles, has moved to the City Planning Commission. The feisty opposition group is deeply in debt and has been hard put to combat the museum\\'s flashy P.R. outfit, its expensive lawyers and puissant board. But its battle is worth supporting. New York has only one Guggenheim. Let\\'s keep it the way Wright built it. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0047': 'Shrinking Wage Gap Helping U.S. Firms --- By Kenneth H. Bacon</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Since 1982, foreign manufacturers have enjoyed considerably lower labor costs than U.S. companies. But the gap between U.S. and foreign pay is disappearing quickly, a clear sign that the falling dollar is improving the ability of American manufacturers to compete in world markets.  From 1982 to 1985, for example, the hourly compensation, when converted to dollars, of Japanese production workers was 50% of U.S. compensation costs. This gave Japanese manufacturers a huge cost advantage over U.S. companies. But by the end of January, Japanese compensation costs had risen to 79% of the U.S. level, according to estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Largely because of the falling dollar, West German labor costs rose to 120% of those for U.S. production workers from 75% in 1985. Total compensation costs -- wages plus benefits -- for workers in Sweden and several other European countries also top U.S. levels.  \"That\\'s a good sign that the U.S. is regaining its ability to compete,\" says C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.  The U.S. must increase its exports, both to fuel domestic economic growth and to reduce the trade deficit -- nearly $170 billion last year -- which has helped make the U.S. a debtor nation and strained the world economy. \"Virtually all of the trade improvement must come in the manufactured sector, since agriculture faces a persistent world glut and the services account -- which includes the growing burden of interest payments on the foreign debt -- will be worsening,\" Mr. Bergsten says.  With the falling dollar, U.S. manufacturers are in a pretty good position to compete on world markets. Manufacturing productivity has risen smartly. \"Since the business cycle peak in the third quarter of 1981, output per hour in manufacturing has grown at an average annual rate of 3.8%,\" according to the 1987 report of the Council of Economic Advisers. This is \"46% faster than the postwar average of 2.6% per year and more than twice the annual average rate of 1.5% recorded between 1973 and 1981.\"  The combination of rising productivity and low wage increases has held in unit labor costs for manufacturers to an average annual rise of 0.7% since 1981, about one-fifth of the postwar average of 3.4%.  In fact, unit labor costs have risen less in the U.S. than in other industrial countries. U.S. costs rose 11.2% between 1980 and 1985, compared with a rise of 16.3% in 11 industrial nations -- Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  \"In the absence of other developments, the relatively better U.S. performance . . . would have improved U.S. international cost competitiveness,\" the CEA notes. But the U.S. advantage was completely overwhelmed by the rapid rise of the dollar. When measured on a dollar basis, foreign unit labor costs actually fell 19.7% between 1980 and 1985. However, that gap has been shrinking rapidly with the dollar\\'s fall.  A look at Japan shows why. According to the BLS, total hourly compensation for production workers rose to 1,599 yen in 1986, up only 3.8% from 1,539 yen in 1985. But when the yen wages are converted to dollars to show the impact of exchange rates, compensation rose 47% to the equivalent of $9.50 in 1986 from $6.45 in 1985. This is how a Japanese exporter earning revenues in dollars might look at his labor costs.  To compensate for the rising yen, Japanese manufacturers are doing exactly what U.S. factories did to cut costs when the dollar was high -- laying off workers, building plants abroad and purchasing more goods from countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, where wages still are low.  Although the dollar began to fall two years ago, U.S. trade performance is just beginning to turn around. In the final quarter of 1986, net real exports -- the difference between exports and imports adjusted for inflation -- improved by 15.3%, a significant gain after six years of deterioration.  Rising import prices are crimping demand for foreign goods and \"there are encouraging signs from manufacturers that orders from Europe and Japan are picking up,\" says Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. The aircraft, computer, electrical machinery, paper, lumber and chemical industries are \"experiencing noticeable upswings in foreign demand,\" Wharton says.  The dollar\\'s recent fall should further increase exports, which must expand dramatically to cure America\\'s trade problem. \"The U.S., as a debtor country, will have to stop spending more than it produces,\" Mr. Bergsten says. \"America for many years to come will be producing goods and services for consumption in the rest of the world, in a reversal of the buying-on-credit binge of the past half decade.\" The closing wage gap is crucial to that transition.  ---  Hourly Compensation For Production Workers (As a percentage of U.S. costs) Jan. 31 1985    1986     1985 West Germany    75      103     120 Japan           50       73      79 South Korea     11       12      12 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0045': \"Against Japanese Microchip Companies --- By Art Pine Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) COMPUTERS (EDP) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> The Reagan administration is likely to decide this week to impose sanctions on Japanese microchip-makers for violating last summer's semiconductor trade accord.  At a meeting Friday, a subcabinet task force reviewed new Commerce Department data and concluded that Japanese manufacturers are continuing to dump their products in third-country markets despite a provision in the July 31 agreement that prohibits such practices. The group renewed a recommendation made in late February that the U.S. take punitive action. Dumping is selling in foreign markets at prices below the cost of production or fair market value at home.  The issue next goes to the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council, which has scheduled a meeting for mid-week. Although that panel could postpone any judgments in the case, U.S. officials say it's almost certain to recommend sanctions.  Late Friday, officers of several U.S. semiconductor makers met with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and a group of senators and congressmen to renew their plea for sanctions.  The panel also is slated to consider whether to retaliate against the Japanese government for refusing to buy U.S.-made supercomputers. Although American manufacturers clearly hold the lead in these highly sophisticated products, Tokyo has rejected U.S. pleas that it force its ministries and agencies to relax their ban on importing these devices. The issue has become an emotional one here in the U.S. American manufacturers already sell supercomputers to non-government buyers in Japan.  U.S. trade strategists still haven't decided precisely how to retaliate on the semiconductor issue. They say the most likely option would be for the U.S. to impose punitive tariffs on Japanese products -- such as laser-printers -- that use semiconductors. They would do that, rather than trying to limit imports of microchips themselves, to avoid hurting U.S. corporations that use imported microchips in the products they make.  Even if the Economic Policy Council agrees to retaliate against the Japanese, the sanctions probably wouldn't take effect until mid-April. Current practices require U.S. officials to draw up a list of potential targets and allow affected parties here to comment on their likely impact. Washington followed similar procedures earlier this year in imposing tariffs on European wine and cheese imports in retaliation for new Common Market tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. The two sides later worked out a settlement, and the retaliatory tariffs were withdrawn.  The council action this week won't deal with charges by U.S. chipmakers that Japan hasn't lived up to promises in the semiconductor accord that it allow U.S. manufacturers to gain a larger share of the microchip market in Japan.  The subcabinet-level meeting Friday came as the Japanese government, in an 11th-hour effort to ward off U.S. retaliation, told heads of 10 large Japanese semiconductor makers to increase their purchases of foreign-made microchips and to stop dumping in foreign markets. The plea came from Hajime Tamura, the country's trade minister.  U.S. officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Tamura's action would have any effect on the Economic Policy Council's decision this week. The U.S. warned Japan in November that U.S. manufacturers were unhappy with the way the pact was being enforced. Tokyo has announced several moves to crack down on violations, but so far none has succeeded.  Separately, the two countries announced that Japan has agreed to open its markets to U.S. exports of processed pollack and herring. Import quotas have barred such sales in the past.  Specifically, Japan will broaden its quota system and issue enough import licenses to accommodate all U.S. exports of these products. U.S. officials estimate that the move will result in $85 million in additional U.S. sales this year, and that such sales eventually could grow to $300 million annually.  The U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord, negotiated at the request of some U.S. microchip makers, provided for Japanese producers to stop dumping both here and in third-country markets. It also called on Japan to allow U.S. producers a larger share of Japan's own market. However, because the dumping involves actions by private concerns rather than by the Japanese government, it has proved difficult to enforce. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0044': 'But Side Effects Pose a Challenge --- By Marilyn Chase Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN> Treatment for the ailing heart may soon get better, but scientists say it won\\'t get simpler.  Tissue plasminogen activator, Genentech Inc.\\'s promising clot-dissolving drug, may win Food and Drug Administration approval in a few months as a treatment for heart attack -- an event that befalls 1.5 million Americans a year and kills 550,000 of them. Twice as effective as conventional clot dissolvers, with less internal bleeding and bruising, TPA is expected to become biotechnology\\'s first billion-dollar product by the early 1990s. Researchers now speak of expanding its use to a panoply of cardiovascular diseases.  But what the public may not realize in the early excitement over TPA is that high dosages of the drug still pose a risk of internal bleeding, and that not all heart-attack patients are appropriate candidates for it. Further, despite TPA\\'s apparent superiority over conventional therapy in prolonging life, statistical proof remains elusive.  Although these complications have been discussed in medical circles, popular news articles about TPA -- and even Genentech itself -- appear to have underplayed side effects. The company\\'s annual report, for example, has a dramatic photo of a patient receiving intravenous TPA en route to a hospital. However, Genentech\\'s top management now disavows any early hope of widespread paramedic application.  One result of minimizing problems with the drug may be disappointment for people who had hoped to see it used widely and freely. Another may be that patients who shouldn\\'t take TPA will press their doctors to prescribe it.  \"The use of this drug isn\\'t idiot-proof,\" Eugene Braunwald of the Harvard Medical School told scientists and doctors at a recent Harvard-Genentech seminar on TPA in New Orleans. TPA \"is going to be an enormous challenge to the medical profession,\" he added. Scientists agreed that expert medical care and control must guide TPA\\'s administration.  TPA dazzled the medical world in 1985, when the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute reported the drug had opened clogged arteries in 66% of test patients -- twice as many as the the previously most potent clot-dissolving agent, streptokinase, made by the U.S. unit of Hoechst AG of West Germany and by Kabivitrum AB of Sweden. By now, TPA has been given to about 4,000 patients world-wide, and its clot-dissolving record tops 80%.  But balancing bleeding and clotting is complex. Researchers recently disclosed that more than 1% of patients in a later phase of the institute\\'s study suffered bleeding in the brain while on a high-dose regimen. \"I don\\'t want to suggest that we can use infinitely high-dose TPA, or even a modest dose for an extended period, without the risks of bleeding,\" said Burton Sobel of Washington University, St. Louis.  Nor is TPA the solution for all heart-attack patients. It works better in a first heart attack than in later ones, says Eugene Passamani, a clinical researcher at the heart institute. And it should be used soon after an attack, but researchers at New Orleans differed on whether the cutoff should be at four hours, six hours or later. Some researchers say TPA\\'s use should be restricted to patients with \"anterior myocardial infarct,\" a serious heart attack damaging the heart\\'s forewall. Finally, bleeding risks grow in patients over 70.  Because heavy demand is expected for the drug, some analysts distinguish between how many people should get TPA and how many people will get it. Robert Kupor, an analyst at Cable Howse &amp; Ragen of Seattle, contends that 250,000 to 300,000 should get the drug. \"But,\" he says, \"probably (500,000) patients actually will get it due to pressure on doctors in marginal cases.\" On that basis, he projects probable U.S. sales totaling $700 million to $750 million in 1990, with royalties from foreign licenses boosting final TPA revenue to $850 million. Genentech calculates the \"eligible population\" at about 750,000 a year.  But early indiscriminate demand for TPA may be tempered as patients encounter bleeding, says M. Kathleen Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman &amp; Stephens in San Francisco. Doctors are bracing for lawsuits. If malpractice experience with streptokinase is a guide, doctors will be sued for giving the drug -- if a patient bleeds -- or for withholding it.  How well TPA will improve the survival rate of heart-attack patients isn\\'t clear. Genentech scientists infer that, because streptokinase clearly saved lives in European studies and because TPA dissolves clots better than streptokinase, TPA will improve survival significantly. But current statistics are equivocal. Dr. Passamani of the heart institute says it would take many more thousands of test patients to prove TPA\\'s superiority.  Meanwhile, other researchers are testing TPA in other cardiovascular diseases. These include: unstable angina, the chest pain that may precede heart attack; pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the lung; and peripheral arterial occlusion, blockage often due to a leg clot.  Chest pain, sometimes from clot buildup in the heart, affects millions of Americans, some of whom later suffer heart attacks. Herman K. \"Chip\" Gold, a researcher at Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital, studied about two dozen angina patients, giving half TPA and half a placebo. Pain persisted in six of 11 placebo patients but in only one of 12 TPA patients. Eleven of the TPA patients bled, only three of them seriously.  Dr. Gold, who also serves as a consultant for Genentech, asserts that further angina studies may lead to a role for TPA in preventing heart attack.  Pulmonary embolism can lead to heart dysfunction, hypertension and death. But Samuel Z. Goldhaber of Harvard and Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital in Boston reported that TPA dissolved lung clots in 44 of 47 patients he tested, most without major complications. However, he noted that two of them bled seriously enough to require surgery.  Peripheral artery blockage responded well to TPA in early tests, according to Robert Graor of the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Graor told the New Orleans group that clots dissolved in 61 of 65 such patients, although 76% of them also required later surgery or angioplasty. He believes TPA is safer than streptokinase.  Despite Genentech\\'s long head start in developing and marketing TPA, it has aggressive competition from the team of Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and Wellcome PLC of London, which goes to court in June to try to block Genentech\\'s UK patent on TPA. Other contenders include the Swiss-American Biogen Inc., Integrated Genetics Inc., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Chiron Corp.  Just as penicillin ushered in a new age of antibiotics, some analysts say TPA may eventually head a group of new clot-dissolving substances.  Beecham Laboratories, a unit of Beecham Group of London, is developing a form of streptokinase called \"APSAC.\" An agent called \"SCUPA\" or pro-urokinase, is under development by Grunenthal G.m.b.H. of Germany and Collaborative Research Inc., working with Sandoz Inc., a subsidiary of the Swiss Sandoz Ltd. Victor Gurewich, of St. Elizabeth\\'s Hospital in Boston, told the New Orleans group that heart-attack victims may one day take a sort of synergistic cocktail -- a shot of TPA, with a SCUPA chaser.

But who will win Goldcrest?  Goldcrest, a production company formed 10 years ago by Pearson PLC, has produced both remarkable hits and spectacular flops. Pearson has seen enough of both. \"We now feel the film industry isn\\'t for us,\" says Alan Whitaker, a director of Pearson, the diversified British conglomerate that, among other things, publishes Penguin books and the Financial Times.  Pearson, which owns 41% of Goldcrest, and three institutional investors holding another 18% have agreed to sell most of Goldcrest to Earle I. Mack, a New York real estate developer who has invested in movies. But a flurry of interest from British companies dangling the prospect of higher offers than Mr. Mack\\'s is complicating the effort to win approval of other shareholders.  To the surprise of its board, Goldcrest \"is like the girl at the dance who once the first guy asks her suddenly becomes very attractive,\" says Jake Eberts, who started the company for Pearson, left in 1983 and returned to rescue it in 1985. \"We\\'re being approached all the time by people throwing money at us and offering salvation and hope.\"  Despite two hugely expensive box-office disasters in recent years -- \"Revolution\" and \"Absolute Beginners\" -- Goldcrest is attracting interest because of its reputation and library of past hits like \"Gandhi\" and \"Chariots of Fire.\" After the equivalent of about $48.2 million of write-offs in the past two years, the company has refocused on its original goal of making quality movies with British talent. This year, \"The Mission\" and \"A Room with a View\" together received 15 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director nominations for each film.  Goldcrest\\'s board has promised to make its \"best efforts\" to conclude the deal with Mr. Mack, who has offered to buy 85% of Goldcrest for about $9.1 million. But the agreement must be approved by holders of 75% of the company at a meeting yet to be scheduled, and that seems far from assured.  A bid already has been made by Masterman Productions, an expansion-minded production company owned by Brent Walker Group PLC, a leisure company known for operating dog tracks, and Ensign Trust PLC, an institutional investor. Masterman claims control of 13% of Goldcrest and is \"reasonably convinced\" that holders of another 13% would like Goldcrest to consider other bids, says Philip Axford, a corporate-finance partner at James Capel &amp; Co., Masterman\\'s financial adviser. Masterman wants to buy Goldcrest and inject new working capital in a transaction it values at about $18.3 million.  Also interested is Hemdale Holdings Ltd., a British-owned production company that finances mostly U.S. movies, including \"Platoon\" -- the surprise hit that also is up for the Best Picture Oscar. Pearson\\'s Mr. Whitaker says two of Britain\\'s largest entertainment companies also have expressed interest: Granada Group PLC, which operates one of the major regional broadcasting franchises, and Virgin Group PLC, a record and music-publishing company that co-financed \"Absolute Beginners\" with Goldcrest.  Mr. Eberts, a Canadian citizen and former Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment banker, first approached Pearson in 1974 about backing a film of \"Watership Down,\" a novel published by Pearson\\'s Penguin unit. Goldcrest was officially formed three years later and reached its zenith with the Oscar-winning \"Chariots of Fire\" in 1982 and \"Gandhi\" in 1983. In 1984, the last year for which Goldcrest disclosed results, net income was about $2.5 million on sales of around $22.5 million. The U.S., Mr. Eberts notes, represents 75% of the market for Goldcrest\\'s movies.  Goldcrest decided to become a force in TV programs and even satellites. It raised more money from British institutions and took out its first major bank loans. In a seeming rush to spend it all, it budgeted approximately $70.6 million for \"Absolute Beginners,\" \"Revolution\" and \"The Mission.\" The films ran far over budget and behind schedule. \"The Mission,\" the last of the three to be released, is likely to lose money even if it wins Oscars.

       " 'WSJ870323-0041': 'Without Collateral Takes Ingenuity --- But John Grambling Knows How to Appeal to Bankers And How to Fake Assets --- By Ed Cony Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> A couple of years back, two businessmen on the make tried to steal $36.5 million from four banks and a savings and loan association. And without pointing a gun at anybody, they actually made off with $13.5 million. Their .370 batting average wasn\\'t bad, but they got caught.  The story of John A. Grambling Jr. and Robert H. Libman, one of the most bizarre in recent banking history, came to light in 1985 and 1986, as the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office in New York was investigating and prosecuting the partners.  Court records and interviews with investigators and bank officials show that the tale begins at the end of 1984, when Messrs. Grambling and Libman heard that Husky Oil Ltd. wanted to sell its U.S. refineries and gas stations for tax reasons. Their acquisitive instincts aroused, the two men set out to buy what Husky was selling.  Never mind that they were broke and that Husky\\'s asking price approached $100 million.  Messrs. Grambling and Libman weren\\'t well known in the business world, either, though Mr. Grambling\\'s father had once been the president of the Texas Bar Association and the family is prominent in El Paso.  The partners\\' scheme involved hitting up Bank of Montreal for $75 million. With their loan application, they submitted a detailed balance sheet for Mr. Libman, who is 57 years old, showing his net worth to be $23 million. His listed assets ranged from $17.5 million in marketable securities to two Jaguar XJ6s valued at $68,000.  The bank refused them the $75 million but did agree to lend Mr. Grambling $7.5 million in interim financing after he offered as collateral 375,000 shares of Dr Pepper stock with a market price of $8,252,992. The shares were to be delivered to the bank.  The closing of Mr. Grambling\\'s loan took place Dec. 28, 1984, in New York, where Mr. Grambling\\'s former employer, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., was supposedly holding his Dr Pepper shares for him. Mr. Grambling, who is 36 years old, had been an associate investment banker at Lazard.  The document assigning the stock to Bank of Montreal bore the signatures of Peter Corcoran, a longtime Lazard partner, and Robert Wilkis, a Lazard vice president.  At the end of the loan closing, when everything seemed to be in order, a call was placed to Ivor Hopkyns, the Bank of Montreal official handling the loan in Canada. And before he would release the $7.5 million to Mr. Grambling, Mr. Hopkyns wanted to chat with Mr. Corcoran. Mr. Grambling said that he would have to get Mr. Corcoran\\'s phone number in Florida, where the Lazard official was on vacation. That done, Messrs. Hopkyns and Corcoran spoke briefly, and Mr. Grambling got his $7.5 million.  Bank of Montreal didn\\'t yet have possession of the promised collateral, which under the terms of the transaction didn\\'t have to be delivered to the bank until Jan. 22, 1985, more than three weeks after the bank let the money loose to Mr. Grambling.  On Jan. 15, Ivor Hopkyns phoned Mr. Wilkis at Lazard to ask after the Dr Pepper stock. And Mr. Wilkis seemed to be irritated by the call. He said that this was the first he had heard about any such deal.  To the consternation of Mr. Hopkyns, the conversation went something like this (according to both men involved):  Mr. Hopkyns: But you signed the loan agreement.  Mr. Wilkis: I didn\\'t sign any agreement.  Mr. Hopkyns: But I\\'ve got the document right in front of me, signed Robert W. Wilkis.  Mr. Wilkis: You\\'ve got a problem. My middle initial is M, not W.  Mr. Hopkyns, alarmed, then phoned Mr. Corcoran at Lazard and got another shock. When he heard the voice, he realized at once that the Mr. Corcoran he was talking to sounded not at all like the Mr. Corcoran he had phoned in Florida.  The truth was that Mr. Grambling didn\\'t own a single share of Dr Pepper. The documents were forged; so were the signatures of Messrs. Corcoran and Wilkis. The Libman balance sheet was made out of whole cloth. The Peter Corcoran that Ivor Hopkyns had phoned in Florida was, in reality, Robert H. Libman doing an impersonation.  Before the day was out, a worried Mr. Hopkyns phoned Mr. Grambling, who did his best to reassure him. Mr. Grambling told him that there had been an administrative foul-up. His Dr Pepper shares had mistakenly been transferred to Coronado Bank in El Paso.  He promised to straighten things out. And, as a gesture of good faith, he volunteered to send Bank of Montreal an unscheduled payment of $2 million, even though the bank wasn\\'t due to get its $8 million in collateral for another seven days.  However, among the facts Mr. Grambling failed to disclose to Mr. Hopkyns was that, to keep other creditors at bay, he had spent nearly all the $7.5 million he had borrowed less than three weeks earlier. And, of course, he still faced the problem of producing the nonexistent Dr Pepper shares.  The $2 million Mr. Grambling then actually did send to Bank of Montreal compounded his financial problems because it came from the proceeds of a $6 million loan he had just obtained, fraudulently, from Colorado National Bank of Denver.  Initially, Mr. Grambling had asked Colorado National to lend him $100 million. Thomas Foncannon, a Colorado National vice president, said in an affidavit that a loan of $100 million was \"quite a bit larger than the bank was comfortable with.\"  Mr. Grambling promptly lowered his sights. He said he had interim financing requirements in the Husky Oil deal that the bank could help him with. Which is how Colorado National came to lend him the $6 million. He got the loan after giving the bank his personal financial statement, which was even more fanciful than Mr. Libman\\'s. The statement reported total assets of $40 million, net worth of $39 million and annual income of $908,000.  Mr. Foncannon said in his affidavit that his calls to several banks inquiring about Mr. Grambling\\'s reputation had turned up nothing to be concerned about. Indeed, several bankers actually praised Mr. Grambling. For instance, according to Mr. Foncannon, Charles Worth, a vice president of Arizona\\'s Bank of Scottsdale, characterized his banking relationship with Mr. Grambling as \"super.\"  Boy and man, John Grambling was always popular. In high school, he was a member of the speech team. As an undergraduate at Southern Methodist University, he was elected president of his dormitory and an officer of his fraternity. He was bright, too. He earned an M.B.A. degree at the Wharton School of Finance. A schoolmate characterized him as the last person anyone would suspect of fraud.  But, with bankers, he had more than a winning personality going for him. In at least three instances, he had made loan repayments ahead of schedule. He repaid $708,000 to Bank of Scottsdale, $1.8 million to American Bank of Commerce in El Paso and $418,000 to First Financial Bank of El Paso.  These payments depleted the $7.5 million he had borrowed from Bank of Montreal by $2.9 million but made him look like a better risk.  What Messrs. Grambling and Libman were up to here was a Ponzi scheme, which works like this: You fraudulently obtain a loan from Bank A. You go on to Bank B and get another loan, using some of Bank B\\'s proceeds to pay back some of your debt to Bank A. That keeps creditors satisfied temporarily and preserves your credit rating for a foray against Bank C.  Brian Rosner, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan who eventually prosecuted Messrs. Grambling and Libman for bank fraud, says of the Ponzi ploy: \"It\\'s called robbing Peter to pay Paul, and as long as it works -- as long as the money comes in -- no one knows he\\'s being victimized.\" Besides, he says, \"No one is more complacent than a banker who has been repaid.\"  But Bank of Montreal officials -- anything but complacent -- instructed their New York law firm, Shearman &amp; Sterling, to alert the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office to possible crimes within its jurisdiction by Messrs. Grambling and Libman.  This warning came in early February of 1985, and it signaled trouble for the two freebooters, even though they were well on their way to pulling off three more swindles. Their targets and the amounts they sought to borrow (or steal):  First Security Bank of Utah in Salt Lake City -- $8 million. First Interstate Bank of Denver -- $5 million. Security Savings &amp; Loan Association, Jackson, Miss.$10 million.  Again, Mr. Grambling used his well-tested techniques for separating bankers from their money. He doctored loan agreements and other documents. Once more, he wildly misrepresented his net assets. And he got Mr. Libman to do some new impersonations on the telephone.  Mr. Grambling\\'s effort to get millions from First Security Bank came within a whisker of succeeding.  He submitted a financial statement to First Security attesting that he owned 358,600 shares of Southern Union Co. stock, shares that had a market value of nearly $10 million. And he offered the stock, which, as usual, he didn\\'t truly own, as collateral.  To further deceive First Security, he set up a conference call between the bank\\'s loan committee and Mr. Libman posing as Blair Mullin, an actual official of Bank of Montreal. As additional collateral, the loan committee accepted the fake Mr. Mullin\\'s assurances that the Utah bank would have recourse to funds from a loan Mr. Grambling was negotiating with Bank of Montreal. So assured, the First Security committee agreed to lend him the money.  But at the 11th hour, First Security got lucky. Scott Clark, a lawyer representing the Utah bank, phoned a man who supposedly was Ronald Keenan, the president of Coronado Bank in El Paso, where Mr. Grambling did some of his banking business. Mr. Keenan was portrayed for this occasion by an unidentified impostor (not by Mr. Libman this time).  Mr. Clark, who was looking for an agent to hold the 358,600 Southern Union shares and to arrange for their delivery to Salt Lake City, asked who currently had custody of the stock.  \"Mr. Keenan\" replied that the local Merrill Lynch office had the certificates. Mr. Clark agreed quickly on Merrill Lynch as the agent because it had an office in the bank\\'s Salt Lake City building, which would facilitate delivery of the stock. That news jolted the ersatz Mr. Keenan, who knew the Southern Union stock was a figment.  He said that he had better confirm that Merrill Lynch did actually hold the certificates. He hung up and called back shortly to say he had been mistaken. The shares were in the hands of E.F. Hutton\\'s El Paso office, Mr. Keenan said. That, too, was just fine with Mr. Clark, because Hutton also had an office in the building. At that point, Mr. Keenan said he would again have to check on exactly where the shares reposed.  He made another call and came back on the line with the news that the stock was at Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner, a Texas brokerage firm with no offices whatever in Utah.  His suspicions aroused, Mr. Clark demanded to have the original Southern Union stock certificates sent directly to him. When Mr. Grambling couldn\\'t deliver nonexistent shares, First Security slipped the swindlers\\' noose.  A few weeks later, Jim Conover, a First Security official, was reminded of how close the bank had come to losing $8 million. He remarked: \"It\\'s like Vietnam, when you heard the bullets whistling by your head.\"  Mr. Grambling went back to the well again in trying to take First Interstate Bank for $5 million. His collateral consisted of phony Southern Union stock, falsely valued at more than $5 million. And when it came to staging his $10 million raid on Security Savings &amp; Loan, Mr. Grambling offered $12 million in bogus certificates of deposit.  \"That representation was false. The certificates did not exist. Mr. Grambling\\'s Xeroxes of the certificates and other documentary proof of their existence were forgeries,\" said Mr. Rosner, the Manhattan assistant district attorney in a sworn statement.  The string ran out on Mr. Grambling and Mr. Libman in the spring of 1985, after Mr. Rosner presented evidence uncovered in the investigation of the two partners. On May 7, 1985, a New York County grand jury indicted Mr. Grambling on 32 counts of bank fraud involving Bank of Montreal, Colorado National Bank, First Security Bank of Utah, First Interstate Bank of Denver and Security Savings &amp; Loan Association of Jackson, Miss. Mr. Libman was indicted on two counts -- a conspiracy charge and a fraud charge. New York County got jurisdiction over the case because forged documents in the Bank of Montreal loan were submitted to the bank in Manhattan at the loan closing.  Initially, Messrs. Grambling and Libman pleaded not guilty. Then, last October, as their trials in a New York state court grew near, they changed their pleas to guilty. Mr. Grambling said in his plea that, at the urging of his family, he is seeing a Yale University psychiatrist once a week.  Mr. Libman drew a six-month term in New York\\'s Rikers Island prison and has served his time -- four months, with time off for good behavior. The short sentence may reflect Mr. Libman\\'s subordinate role, which Mr. Rosner described in a memorandum to the court: \"Although Mr. Grambling was the lead actor, Mr. Libman had more than a walk-on part.\"  Mr. Grambling has yet to be sentenced. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison; fines and restitution could total $40.5 million.  But while free on bail, Mr. Grambling was doing business as usual, which turned out to be expensive for two new bank victims. It also further embroiled him with the law.  Last June, Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Chicago closed a loan of $350,000 with Mr. Grambling, secured again by phony collateral, this time American Brands shares with a supposed market value of more than $600,000. Mr. Grambling made off with $250,000 of the bank\\'s money before Colonial caught on and denied him the remaining $100,000.  Mr. Grambling struck again in the fall, when he took CityTrust of Bridgeport, Conn., for $450,000, a loan secured by more than $7 million in such blue-chip stocks as J.P. Morgan, General Motors, Rockwell International, IBM and Standard Oil, all bogus. There, he himself posed as one Robert E. Smith Jr., a fictitious agent for an Arizona businessman.  None of the money Messrs. Grambling and Libman obtained fraudulently from the banks and savings institutions has ever been recovered, though much of the money borrowed from one lender was later repaid to another. Bank of Montreal, for example was repaid $2 million but, in the end, got stuck for $5.5 million. Colorado National Bank hasn\\'t been repaid any of the $6 million it lent.  In December, Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Hartford pondered whether to lend $450,000 to the same Robert E. Smith Jr. but turned him -- that is, Mr. Grambling -- down.  Undaunted, Mr. Grambling approached Great American First Savings Bank of San Diego. Again he misrepresented himself as the owner of IBM shares, which he offered as collateral for a $350,000 loan.  This time the gambit was disastrous for him. On Jan. 5, Mr. Rosner received an internal memo from Colonial Bank, which had been defrauded by Mr. Grambling more than six months earlier. (He has yet to be charged in the Colonial Bank case.) The memo, dated Dec. 31, 1986, said Mr. Grambling had called Colonial that day to say he was at Great American First in San Diego. He was there, he announced, borrowing $350,000, and he would be wiring Colonial Bank the $250,000 he owed. The Colonial memo ended: \"He continues to amaze.\"  Mr. Rosner promptly phoned the San Diego bank to warn of a fraud in progress. Four days later, Mr. Grambling entered Great American First, expecting to get his $350,000. Instead, he was arrested by an FBI agent impersonating a loan officer.  Unable to make bail of $2 million, Mr. Grambling was jailed in San Diego, where he pleaded guilty to federal bank-fraud charges involving the Great American First loan, and he is to be sentenced today on federal charges by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Then he will be flown to New York for sentencing by the state on April 1.  Banks that Messrs. Grambling and Libman defrauded or tried to defraud offer various explanations (or none at all) for how such swindles can happen. Mr. Clark, the attorney for First Security Bank of Utah, which narrowly escaped the scam, lays blame on competition and on trust. \"Banks are highly competitive in trying to place good loans,\" he says. In Mr. Grambling\\'s case, he came to the bank in the company of an executive of the Husky Oil refinery in Salt Lake City that Mr. Grambling had hoped to buy. That association with respectability and Mr. Grambling\\'s \"very nice social graces\" gave him credibility with First Security. \"There\\'s an enormous amount of money banks have and want to lend out,\" Mr. Clark says. \"In New York, they want to lend it to Brazil. In smaller cities, they like to lend it to the local refinery.\"  A banker who did fall for the scheme and who consented to an interview on the condition that his name wouldn\\'t be published, says he has two ideas about avoiding future rip-offs: \"We should tighten up our internal guidelines, and we should be sure we know our borrowers.\" He says that in many years as a banker he has grown accustomed to \"dealing with honest people 99% of the time.\" The banking system, he says, \"is built on trust.\" And a person intent on bank fraud \"is going to get it done.\" As for Mr. Grambling: \"He should be compelled to wear a bell around his neck.\"  James Bussitil, a lawyer for Bank of Montreal, said in an interview that \"the modern banking system is susceptible to fraud because banking basically operates on the basis of trust. We made all the standard checks, and nothing turned up on Grambling.\"  Peter A. Manson, a senior vice president of Bank of Montreal, praised \"the diligence of our account managers\" in bringing to light Mr. Grambling\\'s fraud. He said the incident \"has again reminded this bank, and we expect other banks . . . of the need to know your customer.\"  At the end of his spree, Mr. Grambling was hoist with his own petard. The Great American First \"loan officer\" who nabbed him turned out to be an FBI agent. Thus, the teacher was taught a lesson he had been busy teaching bankers: Beware of impostors. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0040': 'Lewis Is Linked To Jefferies Case --- Sources Say Broker Urged Manipulation of Stock In Fireman\\'s Fund Corp. --- By James B. Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> Salim B. \"Sandy\" Lewis, a well-known arbitrager and former special adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, allegedly asked Boyd L. Jefferies to manipulate the stock of Fireman\\'s Fund Corp. last year, according to people familiar with the government\\'s criminal and civil cases against Mr. Jefferies.  The government announced last week that Mr. Jefferies, who resigned Thursday as chairman of the Los Angeles-based Jefferies Group Inc. securities firm, agreed to plead guilty to two felonies, one of which was related to an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of Fireman\\'s Fund shares just prior to a secondary stock offering by American Express Co. last May 9. The government said Mr. Jefferies is cooperating with the investigation.  In settling related charges, the SEC alleged Mr. Jefferies, acting pursuant to an agreement with an individual who wasn\\'t identified, bought huge blocks of Fireman\\'s Fund at or near the close of trading the day before the offering, thereby boosting the price on the day of the offering.  Mr. Lewis is the individual referred to by the government, the people familiar with the cases said. His name, as well of that of his firm, S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., appeared on subpoenas related to the transaction issued by the government on Friday. Mr. Lewis couldn\\'t be reached for comment.  Subpoenas were received by American Express, Fireman\\'s Fund\\'s controlling shareholder and former parent; Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., co-manager for the secondary offering and a unit of American Express; and Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment banking firm that was the other co-manager, the companies acknowledged.  Also named in subpoenas were Randall D. Smith &amp; Co., a small securities firm, and Randall D. Smith, the firm\\'s founder.  The government is seeking to determine whether anyone at American Express, Shearson Lehman or Salomon Brothers asked Mr. Lewis to set up the arrangement with Mr. Jefferies, according to the people familiar with the investigation. They said the government is also probing the rise in the price of Fireman\\'s Fund shares that occurred several days earlier in the week before the public offering.  Neither Messrs. Lewis and Smith nor anyone at any of the firms receiving subpoenas has been charged with any wrongdoing. The government said that both SEC and criminal investigations of the matter are continuing. Mr. Smith, who is a former partner of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., didn\\'t return phone calls. Mr. Jefferies\\' lawyer, Peter H. Morrison, declined to comment and said Mr. Jefferies wasn\\'t available.  The probe of the $332 million Fireman\\'s Fund offering marks a dramatic widening of the government\\'s probe of wrongdoing on Wall Street. Not only does the offering under scrutiny involve some of the financial community\\'s most prestigious corporations, but it is the first indication that the scandal has spread from takeovers to the more staid world of corporate finance, traditionally the heart of investment banking.  Mr. Lewis, who is 48 years old, has long had close ties to American Express\\'s chairman, James D. Robinson III. American Express helped launch Mr. Lewis\\'s arbitrage firm in 1977 with a $3 million investment, and Mr. Lewis helped arrange American Express\\'s acquisition of Investors Diversified Services Inc. in 1983 and of Shearson in 1981. S.B Lewis &amp; Co. earned a $3.5 million fee from the Shearson acquisition, and American Express remains a major investor in Mr. Lewis\\'s firm. Mr. Lewis has often acted as an informal adviser to Mr. Robinson on matters of corporate strategy.  Mr. Robinson declined to comment on his relationship with Mr. Lewis, but he has told colleagues that he never discussed anything that could be characterized as market manipulation with Mr. Lewis and knew nothing about the alleged manipulation of Fireman\\'s Fund shares.  According to the people familiar with the government\\'s investigation, Mr. Lewis asked Mr. Jefferies to boost the price of Fireman\\'s Fund shares May 8, the day before the scheduled public offering. Fireman\\'s Fund shares, after rising sharply several days earlier, had begun falling as the offering approached. Mr. Lewis agreed to reimburse Mr. Jefferies for any losses incurred on the transactions, the people said.  At or near the close of trading that day, Mr. Jefferies purchased four large blocks of stock, pushing the price of Fireman\\'s shares to $38, at least an eighth of a point higher than the price otherwise would have been, the government said. Mr. Jefferies subsequently sold his holdings at a loss.  As agreed, Mr. Jefferies sent S.B. Lewis &amp; Co. an invoice for about $185,000 for \"investment banking services,\" the people said. But Mr. Lewis then asked that another invoice for about $150,000 be sent to Smith &amp; Co., which is active in the junk bond market. Smith &amp; Co. subsequently paid the sum to Jefferies &amp; Co., which recorded the payment on its books as \"other income.\"  People familiar with the Fireman\\'s Fund offering said Mr. Lewis had no formal role in the offering and would have had no direct incentive to engage in market manipulation or to risk his own capital by reimbursing Jefferies &amp; Co. American Express would have been the most obvious beneficiary of the alleged scheme, since the offering was priced at the close of the market May 8, the day before the public offering. The offering was underwritten on a firm commitment basis, meaning that after the price was fixed, the underwriters bore the risk of any subsequent drop in the stock\\'s price.  Mr. Robinson said, \"We know of absolutely no wrongdoing by anybody at American Express,\" including Shearson Lehman. He said that two law firms hired by the company, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, worked over the weekend and interviewed everybody involved in the underwriting. Mr. Robinson, a personal friend of Mr. Lewis for many years, added, \"I would be shocked if Sandy did anything illegal.\"  A Salomon Brothers spokesman said the firm would comply with the subpoena it received and cooperate fully with the SEC. He added that the firm knew nothing about a government investigation of the offering before last week\\'s announcements.  Within certain limits, it is permissible for underwriters to stabilize the price of a security in a public offering for a relatively brief period after the offering is made. However, for anyone to manipulate the price of a security before the offering is made would be illegal.  Mr. Lewis has been a highly successful but maverick player on Wall Street. His father was Salim Lewis, a legendary Wall Street tycoon who ran Bear Stearns until his death in 1978. Sandy Lewis, known equally for his intellectual brilliance, his excitability and volubility and his lack of tact, was hired and fired by several prominent firms before launching his own successful operation. During 1977, he became a special adviser to SEC Chairman Harold Williams. Investors in his firm have included both Mr. Williams and another former SEC chairman, Roderick Hills, and his wife Carla Hills, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  People on Wall Street expressed unusual shock at the news that Mr. Lewis had been implicated by Mr. Jefferies. Over the years, Mr. Lewis has called for strict compliance with the securities laws and for adherence to the highest ethical standards. Mr. Lewis once worked briefly for confessed insider trader Ivan F. Boesky, and ever since, has urged reporters and SEC officials to investigate Mr. Boesky\\'s activities. It was Mr. Boesky who implicated Mr. Jefferies, who in turn has led investigators to Mr. Lewis. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0038': 'STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN> A group of limited partners sued Ivan F. Boesky and related companies, alleging that the arbitrager misled them in the organization of his $1 billion investment partnership in 1986.  And the lawsuit names a major law firm, for the first time, as a defendant in the volume of litigation growing out of the Wall Street insider-trading scandal. The suit seeks damages from New York attorney Stephen Fraidin, as well as his law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, alleging he and the firm suggested that some of the Boesky partners invest in the venture, called Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co. L.P. It alleges the partnership documents prepared by Fried Frank, a firm that regularly represented Mr. Boesky, were misleading.  The suit also names the New York-based financial services concern of Seligmann Harris &amp; Co., which it says helped secure investors in the venture, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, investment banker for the Boesky partnership.  Two other defendants are two men who have pleaded guilty in the insider-trading scandal, Dennis Levine and Martin A. Siegel. The former investment bankers have said they provided inside information on pending mergers and acquisitions to Mr. Boesky, who has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his insider trading.  Filed Friday in federal court in Manhattan, the lawsuit alleges that the plaintiffs were misled because the documents failed to disclose, among other things, the criminal violations to which Mr. Boesky later agreed to plead guilty.  The suit also says the prospectus failed to disclose certain financial interests of Drexel in the partnership, and declared that Mr. Boesky and his family failed, as promised, to invest at least $20 million in the partnership. The suit also alleges the defendants should have registered the partnership offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  At Fried Frank, a major New York law firm that rarely finds itself on either end of a lawsuit, co-chairman Leon Silverman said, \"the inclusion of our law firm and one of our partners in the lawsuit is irresponsible.  \"The suit lacks any merit whatever,\" added Mr. Silverman, speaking for the firm and for Mr. Fraidin. \"Indeed, it is revealing that plaintiffs\\' counsel refused the opportunity we offered them to examine the facts before filing their lawsuit. We leave it to others to discern the true motivations for including us in this lawsuit, but we intend to defend this litigation and we will win.\"  A Drexel Burnham spokesman said: \"Neither Drexel Burnham nor any of its employees participated in any way in the placement of the Boesky limited partnership interests. So far as we\\'re concerned, the suit is a frivolous attempt to involve Drexel and is totally without merit.\"  Attorneys for Mr. Boesky declined to comment. The lawsuit also seeks restitution or award of unspecified damages from the partnership, Mr. Boesky and related companies.  Under a partial dissolution of Mr. Boesky\\'s main arbitrage fund approved by the SEC last week, limited partners stand to recoup about $278 million of their original $338 million investment. Debenture holders who provided an additional $660 million to Mr. Boesky\\'s approximately $1 billion fund already have been repaid. In effect, the lawsuit is seeking to recover the rest of the limited partners\\' original investment in the partnership, which has been spent in fees and lost through trading activities. It isn\\'t clear what other funds the Boesky companies would have available to repay the claims.  The lawsuit is filed on behalf of more than 40 plaintiffs, both individuals and companies that had invested with Mr. Boesky, including Lewis Lehrman, who recently was named senior adviser of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.\\'s asset management unit; and Martin Peretz, editor in chief and chairman of New Republic magazine; a number of institutional investors; and several insurance companies, including Home Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Newark, Del.-based Home Group Inc.; and Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., a unit of Lincoln National Corp., Fort Wayne, Ind.; and several British investors.  One institutional plaintiff claimed in the suit that its officials asked Mr. Boesky directly whether his claims of \"superior information and knowledge\" were based on \"inside\" information. \"Boesky stated unequivocally that he did not use \\'inside information\\' and that, if he had used \\'inside\\' information, he would be in jail,\" the petition declared.  Home Insurance Co. alleged that it originally declined to invest in the partnership because it didn\\'t know Mr. Boesky, but that in June 1986, Mr. Fraidin suggested to Home that \"the opportunity to invest with Boesky was a good deal that should not be passed up,\" and he \"vouched for Boesky\\'s skill and integrity.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0037': 'This Year is Ahead of Company\\'s Plan --- By Janet Guyon Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN> James E. Olson, chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., told analysts here that the company\\'s cash flow for the first two months of 1987 was above budget and that he is \"very pleased\" with cost-cutting efforts by line managers.  Mr. Olson wouldn\\'t comment on whether the company\\'s profit for the first two months was ahead of budget. Since becoming chairman last September, Mr. Olson has made improving profit at the giant telecommunications concern a top priority; he said he wants the company\\'s return-on-equity to reach at least 20%, nearly double what it was in 1985.  Last year, AT&amp;T took a $3.2 billion write-off to account for job cuts, facility consolidations and inventory write-downs, resulting in 1986 earnings of only $139 million, or five cents a share, on revenue of $34.1 billion. Because of such write-offs, AT&amp;T\\'s return on equity was only 0.3%.  The job cuts and other moves will save AT&amp;T $1 billion this year and $1.4 billion next year, Mr. Olson said, but the New York-based company has warned analysts that those savings won\\'t necessarily translate into earnings increases.  Mr. Olson also said he \"couldn\\'t believe it\\'s going to take\" as long as two years for the Federal Communications Commission to remove its cap on profit from AT&amp;T\\'s long-distance business.  That cap, which allows the company to earn 12.2% on its more than $9 billion of interstate long-distance equipment, is one factor depressing AT&amp;T\\'s earnings. Competitors have recently supported the company\\'s efforts to get regulation removed. \"Frankly, it will be better for everyone, including our competitors,\" if AT&amp;T is de-regulated, Mr. Olson said.  The executive also said the company\\'s \"data networking\" strategy doesn\\'t necessarily encompass a specific set of products and services, but is rather an approach to selling products and services to customers.  For example, he said, AT&amp;T is developing a world-wide computer and phone network for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. that can identify when and where phone lines are down. Similarly, AT&amp;T is testing with American Express Co. a credit card collection system that automatically dials customers, shows that the call has been answered, then transfers the call with a screen of account information to an agent.  Mr. Olson also said that Vittorio Cassoni, the AT&amp;T senior vice president in charge of computer and local area network products that are part of this data networking concept, plans to make his division, Data Systems, profitable within the next two years. \"I think that\\'s a very good target,\" Mr. Olson said, adding the profitability from the data networking strategy \"is in our five-year business plan.\"  Mr. Olson also acknowledged that to execute the company\\'s data networking ideas, \"we do need to spend more time and money training our sales force\" on how to analyze customer\\'s data processing needs. \"We haven\\'t been as good as we could have\" in training salespeople on data processing products, he said. Analysts have citied the lack of a well-trained computer sales force as one reason for AT&amp;T\\'s troubles in that business. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0036': 'Sharp Cutback In Financing --- Some Banks Could Remove Up to $3 Billion in Credit After March 31 Due Date --- By Peter Truell and Roger Cohen Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Brazil\\'s short-term financing from foreign banks could soon be cut by as much as $3 billion, according to bankers in the U.S. and Brazil.  Such a cut could severely damage Brazil\\'s trade-related businesses and make a solution to the country\\'s debt crisis much more difficult to achieve.  Brazil\\'s central bank governor, Francisco Gros, met yesterday in Miami with his country\\'s main creditor banks to try to resolve looming problems with money-market deposits and trade financing, but there was no indication of any concrete progress. About $10 billion of trade credits and $5 billion of money-market deposits fall due March 31.  Brazil froze these credits late in February, shortly after suspending interest payments on $67 billion of its longer-term debt to foreign banks. The country wants to ensure that lenders won\\'t withdraw these short-term credits, which are essential to the smooth running of its foreign trade.  But before yesterday\\'s meeting, bankers in the U.S. and Brazil predicted that some of the short-term financing will be withdrawn. Sergio de Freitas, vice president for international affairs at Brazil\\'s Banco Itau, said he expected a cut of \"at most 10%\" in the $15 billion of credits. Some U.S. bankers and economists, and many other Brazilian bankers, believe the cutback could reach 20%, or $3 billion.  Following yesterday\\'s meeting, Mr. Gros said: \"We made some comments on the current Brazilian situation and what\\'s been happening in Brazil with economic policy.\" Asked how Brazil\\'s major bankers had reacted to his presentation, Mr. Gros said: \"Their reaction was one of disappointment, which is quite understandable. No one is particularly happy about the situation.\"  He said that he and the banks had agreed to work on a telex message over the next couple of days that will be sent to all of Brazil\\'s foreign creditor banks, explaining the current situation and the need for their continued support. The telex will detail what Mr. Gros termed recent measures taken to stabilize the Brazilian economy.  But a banker who attended the meeting with Mr. Gros said that \"he didn\\'t really have much new to say. There\\'s nothing he can say.\" The banker was skeptical about the economic progress promised by Mr. Gros.  Mr. Gros said that further meetings aren\\'t scheduled with the creditor banks during his current visit to Miami, but that he will be available to talk to the bankers until he leaves the city tomorrow evening.  Brazil also asked its creditor banks for a three-month postponement of the $9.6 billion payment of debt principal due April 16, Mr. Gros said. This payment already was postponed once, from late 1986. But the immediate concern is the short-term credits.  Prior to their meeting with Mr. Gros, officials of the country\\'s major creditor banks said they were particularly concerned about foreign banks that have only lent money-market deposits to Brazil. These lenders don\\'t have \"much of a stake in the country,\" said a senior U.S. banker, and therefore might quickly bring legal action if Brazil tried to prevent them from withdrawing their money. Any such legal actions could quickly snowball, further complicating efforts to resolve the country\\'s debt crisis.  Yesterday was the first time Mr. Gros met with the full committee of the country\\'s major creditor banks since Brazil suspended interest payments on its $67 billion of medium-term and long-term debt to foreign banks on Feb. 20. He was somewhat conciliatory yesterday, stressing Brazil\\'s willingness to start paying interest again, provided there can be \"an arrangement that would allow Brazil to grow while servicing its debt.\"  But he also criticized U.S. banks for not reserving adequately against their loans to Brazil and other Latin American countries. And he said a reappraisal of the whole debt issue is needed.  In this tense climate, major banks say they aren\\'t ready to make up for any withdrawal of short-term credits and deposits by other banks. Brazilian and multinational companies therefore are bracing for added difficulties with their import and export businesses, which already have been hampered by the moratorium on debt payments.  Import financing has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and maturities have been severely shortened, according to executives. Such financing is important because many of Brazil\\'s exports rely on imported materials. Most analysts believe smaller Brazilian companies, whose banking relationships are weaker, will have particular financing difficulties.  Mr. de Freitas of Banco Itau said that although he expected a drop in short-term credits and deposits, \"March 31 is not a date when everything will change. The critical point is to know when Brazil will produce an economic policy to generate foreign exchange to pay its interest. Until then, it\\'s going to be a war of attrition, a number of small events over a long period.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870323-0034': 'To Alter Agency\\'s Enforcement Stance --- By Bruce Ingersoll Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> President Reagan\\'s nomination of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad to become ambassador to the Netherlands isn\\'t likely to lead to a letup in enforcement or reversal of any deregulatory initiatives.  No matter who succeeds Mr. Shad, the agency won\\'t go through a turbulent transition, administration and securities industry officials said. \"You still have four commissioners who participated in the policy making under John Shad,\" said former Commissioner A.A. Sommer Jr., a Washington securities lawyer. \"They\\'re a pretty strong-headed bunch.\"  Over the weekend, several new names emerged as possible contenders to succeed Mr. Shad, as the White House expedited its search for candidates of sufficient stature to take over the agency amid Wall Street\\'s widening insider-trading scandal and the torrid debate over curbing corporate takeovers.  The list includes John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange; John Whitehead, deputy secretary of state and a former investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Co.; and New Jersey Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, the ranking Republican member of the House Commerce Committee\\'s finance panel, according to administration sources.  White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker met Friday with Robert Tuttle, the personnel director, to discuss several presidential appointments, including the SEC post. \"There is not a narrow list yet,\" a senior White House official said of the SEC job.  Mr. Shad\\'s appointment as ambassador to the Netherlands had been rumored for eight months. Others previously mentioned as candidates for the top SEC job -- and said to remain in the running -- are Kevin T. Duffy, a federal judge in Manhattan; Roger Birk, former chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co.; Arthur Leavitt Jr., American Stock Exchange chairman; and two SEC commissioners, Edward Fleischman and Charles Cox.  President Reagan had wanted Mr. Shad to stay on as chairman, according to administration sources. But Mr. Shad, who already has served longer than any of his 21 predecessors, declined, saying he would prefer an ambassadorship or another post.  The timing of Mr. Shad\\'s departure is likely to depend on how rapidly the Senate Banking Committee moves to confirm his successor. \"If they send up the right kind of candidate, with solid credentials and no baggage, I think Congress will act expeditiously,\" one Senate staff member said.  In a statement yesterday, William Proxmire, Senate Banking Committee chairman, spelled out what kind of candidate he has in mind, expressing the hope that the White House will look someplace other than Wall Street for a successor.  \"At this particular time,\" the Wisconsin Democrat said, \"I think we need someone who will be perceived as having absolutely no conflicts of interest in the administration of the SEC, and someone who is very tough on crime.\"  One candidate said to have such credentials is Judge Duffy, who served as the SEC\\'s New York regional administrator from 1969 until 1972.  With Wall Street under a cloud of controversy, few candidates from the securities industry, if any, will be willing to subject themselves to \"microscopic analysis\" at confirmation hearings, an industry source said. Moreover, some candidates may balk at the job because the tenure probably would end in 1988 if a Democrat is elected president.  As a result, the White House may yet turn to Mr. Cox, an economist who is second in SEC seniority, or Mr. Fleischman, a former Wall Street securities lawyer, administration sources said. Such a move would hardly be unprecedented; 12 commissioners have been so elevated in the commission\\'s 53-year history.  The 63-year-old Mr. Shad served beyond the end of his five-year term last June so that he could oversee the blitz against insider trading and shepherd several projects, including the computerization of the SEC\\'s corporate-disclosure filing system.  Mr. Shad, former vice chairman of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., made his early mark as an ardent deregulator. Since 1981, the SEC has streamlined regulations to eliminate duplicative filings of corporate reports and to facilitate the raising of corporate capital. The agency also reached important agreements with Switzerland, Britain, Canada and Japan to cooperate on international cases of securities fraud.  Even some friends have chided Mr. Shad for political ineptitude in his dealings with Congress, however. And many Democrats have faulted the chairman for taking an essentially neutral stance on tender-offer regulation and letting the marketplace -- and the courts -- correct any perceived abuses.  But Mr. Shad\\'s overall performance drew praise. \"On balance, Shad turned out to be a fine chairman,\" said Harvey Pitt, former SEC general counsel.  \"John Shad has been an extraordinarily responsible regulator,\" said Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. \"He knows when to act and when to do nothing.\"  --- Ellen Hume contributed to this article.

       " 'WSJ870323-0033': 'In Attempt to Buy Supermarkets General --- By Francine Schwadel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) Dart Group Corp. stepped up its efforts to acquire Supermarkets General Corp., requesting access to information it said the food retailer is providing to other prospective buyers.  In a letter to Supermarkets General\\'s board on Friday, Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, Dart\\'s chairman and president respectively, asked for a \"selling brochure\" that they said has been distributed to about 20 prospective buyers of the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer.  \"We were denied that information,\" the Hafts said in the letter, \"because we would not sign an agreement prohibiting us from making a bid for Supermarkets General without its approval, as well as otherwise limiting our ability to purchase Supermarkets General\\'s shares.\"  The Hafts\\' refusal to sign the agreement suggests that Landover, Md.-based Dart is contemplating a hostile tender offer if it can\\'t coax Supermarkets General into accepting the $1.62 billion takeover proposal it made two weeks ago. In an interview yesterday, Robert Haft declined to comment on that possibility.  \"We feel that ultimately we\\'ll be the purchaser of the company,\" he said. \"They\\'ve clearly put the company up for sale.\"  As previously reported, Supermarkets General, in an apparent attempt to resist Dart\\'s unsolicited bid of $41.75 a share, has been weighing its options. These include seeking another suitor, taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own. The company has indicated a strong desire to remain independent.  Dart has tried to woo Supermarkets General by saying all terms of its offer are negotiable, including the price.  In addition, the discount retailer said it didn\\'t intend to increase its stake in Supermarkets General as long as negotiations were progressing. Dart currently holds 1.9 million Supermarkets General shares, or less than 5% of the food retailer\\'s common shares outstanding.  Mr. Haft said he and his father wrote to the Supermarkets General board \"in the hope that the board recognizes that we\\'re currently the only bidder and we should be included in any kind of information or access to management.\"  Robert E. Wunderle, vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General, said the company has held \"discussions in good faith\" with the Hafts. He added that the company is \"disappointed that (the Hafts) have chosen to publicize the contents of a letter filled with half truths and distortions.\" He declined to elaborate.  The Hafts\\' letter is \"clearly designed to pressure us into actions that we believe are not in the shareholders\\' best interests,\" Mr. Wunderle said. \"We will not succumb to that pressure, but will continue, as we have previously stated, to explore all possibilities of maximizing shareholder value.\"  Mr. Wunderle added that the company hasn\\'t yet received a report from its investment banker, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., on the Dart proposal and other possibilities.  In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Supermarkets General closed at $42.25, down 12.5 cents, indicating investors hope a higher bid will emerge.  Separately, Supermarkets General and certain executives were sued in state court in Delaware by a shareholder, Stanley D. Bernstein, who contends they illegally tried to thwart takeover offers and entrench themselves. The plaintiff, who claims to represent a class of injured shareholders, is seeking an order requiring Supermarkets General to negotiate \"in good faith with all bidders.\"  In their letter, the Hafts described meetings last week with Supermarkets General\\'s representatives as \"not productive.\" They said the Supermarkets General representatives outlined several proposals for payments to that company\\'s executives as part of a transaction. These included payments of more than $5.7 million to Leonard Lieberman, the company\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, and two other executives as \"an immediate \\'cash out\\' of their severance agreements,\" according to the letter.  Mr. Haft said the implication was that Mr. Lieberman and James Dougherty, the company\\'s executive vice president, plan to leave the company if it is sold.  He suggested that the two executives\\' interests might not reflect shareholders\\' interests. \"Every dollar paid to top management above and beyond their present agreements, is a dollar out of the shareholders\\' pockets,\" he said.  Mr. Haft said the two sides never discussed the price shareholders would receive. \"They wouldn\\'t tell us whether our price was fair or adequate. They did not give us any response to our offer.\" ',\n",

The truck maker said the group agreed not to buy Clark voting stock for 10 years.  Clark last week sued Arthur Goldberg, president of International Controls Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., who led the group, and other group members, charging that they tried to extract \"greenmail\" from Clark. Greenmail occurs when a company buys back an investor\\'s stock at a premium, often under the threat of a takeover.  Mr. Goldberg said yesterday that his group sold its shares Friday at the market price on the New York Stock Exchange, and that he understands the shares were purchased by Clark.  He said his group initially bought the stock as a \"long-term investment,\" but decided to sell after recent management steps, including the adoption of an anti-takeover provision. \"People buy shares to make a profit, and we were concerned they were doing things that would undermine that goal,\" Mr. Goldberg said.  In composite trading on the Big Board, Clark common shares closed at $25, down $1.875.  Earlier this month Clark adopted a \"poison pill\" takeover-defense measure and said it planned to buy back as many as three million of its 18.8 million shares in the open market. Clark said the purchase of the investor group\\'s shares reduces the number it will buy under the buyback plan. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0031': 'Alleged to Be Owned By Thrift Ex-Officer</HL> Maryland officials said they plan to take possession of $2 million in bearer bonds allegedly owned by Jeffrey A. Levitt, former president of Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association, and his family in violation of a settlement agreement reached last month.  The state on Thursday obtained an order from a state circuit court judge here barring the Levitts from transferring the bonds. In addition, the judge ordered the the Levitts to explain no later than next Friday where the bonds are and to turn them over. Mr. Levitt is serving a 30-year sentence for embezzling funds from Old Court, a privately insured thrift which collapsed in 1985.  However, Paul M. Sandler, an attorney representing Mr. Levitt, said: \"My client has assured me that he doesn\\'t have possession, custody or control of the bonds.\" The lawyer said he consented to the state\\'s injunction because \"my client can\\'t transfer what he does not have.\" He added that Mr. Levitt will report to the judge, as ordered.  Under the terms of the February agreement, the Levitts were supposed to have turned over all but $360,000 of their assets. However, a private investigator hired by the state allegedly uncovered that between August 1984 and August 1985, the Levitts received deliveries of about 390 bonds, which weren\\'t accounted for.  Peter Gunst, an attorney representing the state, said stops have been put on the bonds. He added that numerous banks had advised the state that the coupons hadn\\'t been cashed for the last 18 months.  \"This is what led us to believe that this is a secret cash hoard,\" said Mr. Gunst.

Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN> The British pound, leader of the recent rally in high-yielding currencies, is beginning to look too pricey, some foreign-exchange dealers say.  Although sterling isn\\'t headed for a sharp downturn soon, several factors may stymie any significant advances, the dealers maintain.  \"We don\\'t see a lot of upside potential for sterling from here, but we don\\'t think sterling is about to collapse either,\" says Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker.  Supporting that view is the pound\\'s performance in recent days. It reached a high point of $1.6050 in Friday\\'s New York dealings, but couldn\\'t sustain that level. And against the bellwether European currency, the pound hasn\\'t been able to break 3.00 West German marks.  Other traders, though, remain bullish about sterling\\'s near-term outlook. They cite Britain\\'s continued high interest rates, even with the recent declines, its relatively good potential for economic growth and new optimism about the reelection of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\\'s Conservative Party government. Mrs. Thatcher\\'s political future is considered enhanced by the fiscal 1988 budget presented last week by her chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, which included tax cuts and reduced need for government borrowing.  But politics also figure in the less optimistic outlook for sterling. Last week Mr. Lawson said he was \"content\" with the pound\\'s exchange-rate level but reiterated his opposition to a significant strengthening of the currency. A weak currency helps Britain\\'s exporters by making their goods less expensive in world markets. So a threat of possible Bank of England intervention against the pound hangs over the market.  \"Mr. Lawson\\'s statement after the budget made it very clear; he doesn\\'t want to see it much higher than this,\" Mr. Dennis says.  Britain\\'s widely expected entry into the European Monetary System poses a longer-term threat to the pound, traders say. A devaluation of sterling, possibly to 2.80 marks, would precede Britain\\'s admission to the joint float of eight currencies, many traders believe. The Conservative government is believed to favor entry if it survives the next election, which may be called as soon as this summer. Entry and sterling\\'s devaluation are \"a safe bet,\" says Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago.  Still, Britain\\'s political stability, relatively robust economy and, above all, its still-high interest rates will continue to attract investors to the pound, other traders say. Yields on three-month sterling Eurodeposits stood at 9 5/8% Friday, in sharp contrast to 6 3/8% and 3 7/8% for similar dollar and mark deposits, respectively. \"We\\'re still looking for sterling at $1.65,\" says Anthony J. Murphy, a Royal Bank of Canada trader in New York.  But following the pound\\'s appreciation of more than 3.5% against major currencies this month, \"The level right now makes the attraction a lot less,\" Mr. Holzer says. \"It\\'s topping.\"  In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.6042, up from $1.6003 Thursday, but eased to 2.9333 marks, from 2.9338.  In other dealings, the dollar edged lower in sparse trading, slipping to 1.8285 marks, from 1.8333, and to 151.35 Japanese yen, from 151.48.  On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for March delivery rose 30 cents an ounce to $405.60 in moderate trading estimated at 2.2 million ounces.

       " 'WSJ870323-0028': 'Tax on Gasoline as Step to Pare Deficit --- By Monica Langley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) NATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski is leaning toward proposing a boost in the federal gasoline tax, and against a stock-transaction tax, as part of an effort to narrow the federal deficit.  The Illinois Democrat is focusing on the levy in his search for a major revenue raiser to reach a goal set by House Speaker Jim Wright (D., Texas) of finding $18 billion in new revenue. Every one-cent rise in the gasoline tax would raise $900 million to $1 billion a year.  At the same time, Rep. Rostenkowski said he has rejected for now the speaker\\'s proposal to tax stock transactions. In a speech over the weekend, he said there are \"a bunch of questions\" about such a tax, adding that he doesn\\'t expect answers \"by the time the Ways and Means Committee has to act to raise revenues.\"  Rep. Rostenkowski\\'s willingness to make choices about what his tax-writing committee will accept adds to the possibility that the House will enact a tax increase of some kind for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Speaker Wright has said that while he will push to build a consensus among House Democrats to raise taxes about $18 billion a year, he will leave the specifics about how that will be accomplished to Rep. Rostenkowski and the Ways and Means Committee.  The tax boost would be part of a $36 billion deficit-reduction package the House Democratic leadership seeks for the coming fiscal year. An additional $18 billion would come from spending cuts.  President Reagan has vowed to veto any tax increase Congress sends to him. But Rep. Wright said yesterday on CBS\\'s \"Face the Nation\" that the president in fact proposed taxes in his budget, but he labeled them \"user fees.\" Rep. Wright acknowledged that Democrats are sensitive to criticism that they are sure to face if taxes are raised. \"Of course nobody likes to be accused of tax and spend, but it\\'s more honest than borrow and spend,\" Rep. Wright said.  The Ways and Means chairman has zeroed in on the gasoline tax almost by default. He is committed not to change the tax rates passed in last year\\'s sweeping tax bill, despite Rep. Wright\\'s proposal to freeze the top individual tax rate at 38.5% rather than allowing it to fall to 28% next year, as scheduled. And Rep. Rostenkowski won\\'t advocate any increases from Social Security or unemployment taxes.  While the Ways and Means chairman has suggested that revenue could be raised by increasing the excise tax on cigarettes, beer and distilled spirits, a boost in the \"sin taxes\" alone won\\'t raise the amount of revenue the Democratic leaders seek.  Rep. Rostenkowski also is attracted to the idea of raising the gasoline tax because such an action wouldn\\'t be solely a revenue-driven exercise. Raising the gas tax could be justified as a means of strengthening the domestic oil industry and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  But passage of a higher tax on gasoline won\\'t be easy because lawmakers from rural southwestern states are likely to fight such an effort. And last week, the chief Senate tax writer, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D, Texas), said he wasn\\'t ready to endorse a gasolinetax boost.  In rejecting a stock-transfer tax, Rep. Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association in Boca Raton, Fla., on Saturday, \"The fact that many people don\\'t like what\\'s happening in the financial markets doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re going to be hit with a new tax.\"  Rep. Rostenkowski raised several concerns about Rep. Wright\\'s recent proposal to impose a transfer tax of perhaps 0.5% on both buyers and sellers of publicly traded stock. He said that Congress should consider whether such a tax would \"destroy the liquidity of the markets by discouraging transactions where the profit per unit is so small that it would be totally eclipsed by the tax.\"  He added that another concern was whether such a tax \"would weaken our international competitiveness\" since \"financial instruments are an important part of international trade.\" He also voiced worries that markets might move offshore to avoid the tax.  Before a transfer tax can be seriously considered, the Ways and Means chairman said, several issues must be resolved -- including whether people who take losses would be taxed the same as those with gains, what markets would be affected and whether options would be included.  \"Once new ideas like the transaction tax are raised, they often become the focus of discussions that go on for years before any action is taken,\" Rep. Rostenkowski concluded.  Referring to the idea of extending and expanding the tax credit for research and development, Rep. Rostenkowski said, \"The tax writers see no urgency there and are put off by the fact that it would cost billions.\" Some lawmakers have been suggesting extending and enlarging the credit as part of a push to restore U.S. competitiveness.  Despite the search for additional revenue to meet budget-deficit targets, Rep. Rostenkowski said he \"strongly opposes\" a value-added tax.

       " 'WSJ870323-0027': 'Volkswagen Stock Shows Unusual Resilience In Light of Its Currency Exchange Scandal --- By Peter Gumbel</HL> HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN> A currency scandal at Volkswagen has dented the company\\'s standing with many investors. So why has the West German auto maker\\'s stock held up so well after an initial, brief decline?  Europe is abuzz with speculation that a big German bank, probably Deutsche Bank, may be purchasing VW shares to support their price. A VW spokesman says he\\'s heard the talk but has \"no indication that a friendly bank is helping out.\" Deutsche Bank, which has close ties to VW, says it\\'s company policy not to comment on stock market rumors.  The resilience of VW stock strikes some people as unusual in light of all the unanswered questions about the currency affair. Few details have emerged, leaving investors wondering whether there is more bad news to come.  VW stock initially dropped 7% in Frankfurt after the company on March 10 announced that it lost as much as $259 million through falsified foreign exchange contracts. The sum is equal to 80% of VW\\'s net income for 1985, a bumper year. The company said it will make provisions from reserves to cover the loss.  The stock stabilized within 24 hours and since then has climbed about 3% while the German stock market fell almost 5%. \"I\\'m very surprised VW hasn\\'t fallen further,\" says Jens Erhardt, who publishes a German market newsletter. The shares trade only on European exchanges, though orders can be placed through some U.S. brokers.  \"On fundamentals, I think the company is doing okay,\" says Stephen Reitman, an analyst at Phillips &amp; Drew in London, \"but we\\'re telling people to temper any enthusiasm at the moment and wait until things are a bit clearer.\"  The stock does have a few fans. \"It\\'s a clear buy,\" contends Gabriel Marcus, president of the New York securities unit of DG Bank of West Germany. But he warns that VW might face lawsuits in connection with an issue of its stock last fall.  Many German stocks have started to look inexpensive as the Frankfurt market slid in recent weeks, reflecting a retreat by foreign investors worried about the German economy. Even such favorites as Siemens and Daimler-Benz have been pummeled.  German banks and other institutions occasionally support stocks -- particularly new issues that run into difficulty -- without declaring publicly what they are doing. While such undisclosed activity might be illegal in a U.S. market, securities lawyers say, it is legal in Germany.  VW\\'s main bank is Deutsche Bank, whose chairman, F. Wilhelm Christians, has a prominent position on the auto maker\\'s supervisory board. The bank managed an issue of VW stock last September, offering nonvoting shares at about 6% above their current trading level and at the same time issuing a strong buy recommendation.  In November VW denied a newsletter report that it had incurred a massive currency loss. Mr. Erhardt says stockholders won\\'t be thrilled if it emerges that VW or Deutsche Bank could have found out about the currency fraud before the stock issue.  When the Bonn government eventually sells its 16% stake in VW, a move originally planned for this year but delayed by the foreign exchange affair, Deutsche Bank is a leading candidate to manage the transaction. If Deutsche Bank is supporting the VW stock price, \"maybe they\\'re pitching for business\" from the government, suggests one Frankfurt banker.  The currency mess has aggravated stock buyers\\' worries about VW\\'s prospects in export markets. In 11 months, VW shares have been halved to $181 from a high of $375. \"It\\'s going to take them a while to get back their credibility,\" says Rosemary Sagar of Drexel Burnham Lambert.  While VW is holding on to its position as market leader in Europe, largely because of its best-selling Golf model, the mark\\'s recent rise against the dollar and other currencies is cutting deeply into profit margins. VW\\'s Audi subsidiary, in the past the strongest earner in the group, has estimated that its profit for 1986 was halved by the falling dollar and technical troubles with its Audi 5000 model in the U.S. A recent joint venture between VW and Ford Motor in South America hasn\\'t yet had an impact on the German company\\'s troubled Brazilian subsidiary, a big drain on profit in recent years. The unit has said that its net loss tripled last year to $145.5 million. And in Germany, VW\\'s stronghold, the company faces growing Japanese competition in a market that analysts say could shrink slightly this year after its recent strong growth.  Even after the foreign exchange debacle, VW\\'s policy is not to hedge against currency fluctuations. The company claims it doesn\\'t need to cover itself since the fluctuations balance each other out in the medium term. That stance is \"just poor management,\" says Dagmar Bottenbruch, a First Boston analyst in New York.  --- Volkswagen Business: Auto maker Year ended Dec. 31, 1985* Sales: $28.71 billion Net income: $325.9 million Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1986*:  Pre-tax earnings: $289.8 million vs. $422.2 million  Ordinary shares outstanding: 24 million *Translated into dollars at current exchange rates.

       " 'WSJ870323-0026': 'Of America Buyer is Sought --- Federal Regulators Want Firm\\'s Sale, Sources Say; Quick Action is Unlikely --- By Stephen J. Sansweet Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN> Federal regulators have been quietly trying for several months to find a buyer for Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation\\'s largest thrift institution, but the prospects aren\\'t good for a sale any time in the immediate future, thrift industry sources said.  Several industry sources said that Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would like to find a buyer for the American Savings &amp; Loan Association unit of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. before he leaves office at the end of June.  National Thrift News, an industry publication, quoted unidentified sources in Washington as saying that the sale of Financial Corp. was a \"top priority\" for federal regulators. A bank board spokesman declined to comment.  \"Ed would like to resolve the situation one way or another before he leaves office, but I\\'m not sure there\\'s enough time to do that,\" said one top California thrift executive.  The word of Mr. Gray\\'s intentions comes at a time when criticism of Financial Corp. and its chairman, William Popejoy, has been growing in California thrift circles. Mr. Popejoy, who couldn\\'t be reached for immediate comment, was brought into Financial Corp. in August 1984 after regulators forced out then-chairman Charles Knapp during a run on deposits and effectively assumed a supervisory role over the thrift.  After initially cutting the size of Financial Corp., Mr. Popejoy has been pushing its growth again with the permission of federal regulators. American Savings has generally been paying somewhat more for deposits and charging less for mortgages than its major healthy main competitors. It also has kept making more fixed-rate mortgage loans than the industry average, gambling that interest rates won\\'t rise precipitously over the next several years. Mr. Popejoy has insisted that he isn\\'t taking many risks because his loans have been hedged to some degree against possible interest rate increases.  Mr. Gray has said previously that any attempt by regulators to actually take over Financial Corp. three years ago would have led to the bankruptcy of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., which couldn\\'t afford a multi-billion dollar bailout. However, he has been pushing Congress for an infusion of as much as $25 billion of capital into the insurance fund despite industry insistence that a much smaller amount is needed.  \"I think Gray is trying to win over the large thrifts, who oppose his FSLIC recapitalization plan, by implying that he would take a problem Financial Corp. off their hands if he had FSLIC money to aid in a takeover,\" one California thrift executive said.  However, a thrift attorney, who said he has been hearing rumors about a government-aided attempt to have Financial Corp. taken over, estimated that such a move would require a buyer to add about $600 million to Financial Corp.\\'s net worth to get it to meet minimum regulatory requirements. The attorney also said he believed a takeover could eventually cost FSLIC as much as $7 billion. The Home Loan Bank Board has said the fund had reserves of $1.9 billion on Dec. 31, but a preliminary General Accounting Office audit claimed FSLIC ended the year technically bankrupt.  In the past, Mr. Popejoy has said he would welcome discussions about a possible acquisition of Financial Corp. or some sort of outside capital infusion.  In recent weeks, as sniping by other thrift industry executives has increased, Mr. Popejoy has been attempting to explain his rationale for increasing the size of Financial Corp. and his strategy for hedging possible risks. Two weeks ago he sought and received a legal opinion that he could spell out that strategy at a meeting of industry executives without causing antitrust problems, industry sources said.  Mr. Popejoy spoke before some of his top competitors after a meeting of the legislative and regulatory committee of the California League of Savings Institutions. Under the ground rules, those in the audience couldn\\'t ask questions or comment on Mr. Popejoy\\'s talk, and the chairman of at least one major thrift left prior to the speech. ',\n",

The issue is important for Mr. Bush, who as the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination is walking a political tightrope, trying to distance himself from the Iran scandal while remaining a team player with Mr. Reagan.  On a campaign trip to Michigan, Mr. Bush made headlines Feb. 12 when he said he \"expressed certain reservations\" to \"key players\" in the administration as the Iran policy developed. Mr. Reagan appeared to undercut that at his news conference Thursday night. When asked if Mr. Bush had objected to the policy as Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger had, Mr. Reagan said, \"no.\"  Marlin Fitzwater, who was Mr. Bush\\'s press secretary until recently becoming Mr. Reagan\\'s chief spokesman, later asked the president about the apparent discrepancy.

       " 'WSJ870323-0023': 'Business as Usual: Economists Disagree About Current Strength, What\\'s Ahead --- By Tom Herman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN> Economists frequently joke that they can predict anything but the future. Lately, though, they are having just as much trouble with the present.  Although this year\\'s first quarter ends a week from tomorrow, there is widespread disagreement over just how strong or weak it has been. There is even more disagreement over the second-quarter outlook and what the implications are for interest rates, the stock market and the currency markets.  According to the average estimate of a dozen analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, the economy is growing at a moderate 3% annual rate this quarter, after adjusting for inflation, and will expand at a 2.8% pace during the next three months. That would be an improvement from the anemic 1.1% pace in last year\\'s fourth quarter. But much of the current quarter\\'s strength came from inventory rebuilding, the analysts say, and the economy\\'s overall tone remains sluggish at best.  If so, that could disappoint investors who are counting on surging corporate profits to fuel additional gains in the stock market. Despite the stronger overall growth expected in this year\\'s first half, many analysts say consumer spending is likely to be unenergetic.  Moreover, the dollar\\'s drop in the foreign-exchange markets and a surge in oil prices have made many bond market investors more leery of the inflation outlook. Although the dollar has stabilized recently, many money managers remain bearish on the U.S. currency, partly because of skepticism about whether the recent monetary pact between the U.S. and five of its leading trading partners will work for long. Also, most analysts in the Journal\\'s survey predict it will take a long time to make any meaningful progress in whittling the huge U.S. trade deficit.  The Commerce Department\\'s initial estimate of first-quarter growth won\\'t be released until April 23. The department used to release an initial, or \"flash,\" estimate of quarterly growth in the final month of each quarter but abandoned that last year because it believed the figures often were misleading.  One of the few things many analysts agree on is that interpreting economic reports lately has been especially difficult because of the tax law that became effective Jan. 1. But few analysts agree on how much effect the law has had.  Only three months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the economy would be so weak early this year, partly because of the new tax law, that the Federal Reserve System would feel obliged to cut interest rates in an effort to avert a recession. Now, analysts say, the prospect of higher inflation and somewhat stronger economic growth could mean that the Fed\\'s next move will be to tighten credit conditions to remind investors of its determination to keep inflation in check.  Yet individual estimates vary enormously. At one extreme, David Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. insists that a \"boom\" already is under way and that business activity will accelerate during the rest of the year, leading to much higher interest rates. He contends that the economy will accelerate so rapidly that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit conditions by mid-May, and that interest rates will surge about three percentage points by year\\'s end.  But A. Gary Shilling, an economic consultant, argues that the economy hardly is growing at all this quarter. John D. Paulus of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. forecasts even slower growth next quarter, with interest rates dropping a full percentage point during the next three to six months. Mr. Paulus and several other analysts also expect weak growth in many other leading industrial nations, a development they say will increase pressure for lower world-wide borrowing costs.  Confronted by such diverse views and by a morass of contradictory government economic reports, many investment managers say they are waiting to make any major strategy changes until clearer signals of the economy\\'s health emerge. Meanwhile, bond prices have hardly budged in the past few months, reminding traders of the monotonous 1960s and early 1970s.  If there is a majority view right now, it seems to be that the economy and interest rates will be trendless for at least another month or two. \"Rates probably will stay as is, with a greater chance they could move down a little than move up,\" says Robert Chandross, chief economist of Lloyds Bank in New York.  Mr. Chandross and many other analysts weren\\'t too impressed by the recent monetary accord between the U.S., Canada, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France. That was \"one of the great nonmeetings of all time,\" Mr. Chandross says. \"There was nothing earth-shattering in there, no hard, concrete agreements.\"  Inflation appears likely to accelerate this year, according to most analysts in the Journal\\'s survey. According to the average estimate among the dozen economists, prices -- as measured by a gauge based on the gross national product known as the deflator -- rose at a 3.2% annual rate in the first quarter and will increase at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter. In 1986\\'s final quarter, the deflator rose only 0.7%.  Mr. Levine continues to be optimistic about the economic outlook, even though he has been predicting a big boom and higher interest rates for more than a year now. At a recent conference, Mr. Levine acknowledged that his forecast was way off target, quipping that \"it\\'s been a little like leaving the landing lights on for Amelia Earhart.\" Now, though, he says, \"I think the wait finally is over. It\\'s unnerving that nobody else thinks so, but I think the evidence finally is pointing in that direction.\"  --- Friday\\'s Bond Activity Most interest prices wound up little changed once again in light trading volume. The federal funds rate, the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.10%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That compared with Thursday\\'s average of 6.06%.  The rate on the Treasury\\'s latest three-month bills inched higher to 5.51% bid from 5.50% Thursday. The rate on the Treasury\\'s latest six-month bills climbed to 5.55% bid from 5.51%.  In the bond market, the Treasury\\'s 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell slightly to 99 24/ 32 from 99 27/32 Thursday, while the yield edged up to 7.52% from 7.51%.

       " 'WSJ870323-0021': 'New Jefferies Chief Shows Low-Key Style --- By John R. Emshwiller Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Frank E. Baxter comes from a tiny California town that bears his family\\'s name. Now he faces the challenge of running a big-time brokerage firm that carries the name and mark of another man.  Last week, the 50-year-old president of Jefferies Group Inc. was given the post of chief executive officer after the stunning resignation of the firm\\'s founder, chairman and chief executive, Boyd Jefferies. In the latest chapter of the insider-trading scandal, Mr. Jefferies, 56, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating securities laws. No one else in the firm was implicated.  The new chief executive is in some respects a sharp contrast to the charismatic and driven Mr. Jefferies, who, according to one Wall Street source, \"would chase stock trades all night.\"  Mr. Baxter says he doesn\\'t plan to do any trading as chief executive. He says that is partly to ensure that every trader will have one higher official reviewing his or her work -- a check that was missing in the case of Mr. Jefferies.  Plus, he says he doesn\\'t aspire to the same kind of prominence that Mr. Jefferies had in the securities business. \"I am a more collegial person. I need to share authority,\" says Mr. Baxter, a trim six-footer, who joined Jefferies in 1974.  \"I\\'ve never thought of Frank as being an aggressive personality. He is a nice guy, who you enjoy being with,\" says Donald Weedon, chief executive officer of Weedon &amp; Co., a New York brokerage firm.  Mr. Baxter went into the securities business thanks partly to the military. He says that while growing up in northern California he dreamed of becoming a lawyer. \"As a kid, I sat around law offices and read law books,\" he says. (His family moved when he was very young from Baxter, which Mr. Baxter\\'s great grandfather established as a stagecoach stop during the Gold Rush and which apparently hasn\\'t grown much since.)  But as a teenager, he enlisted in the Air Force. \"On guard duty one day, I saw another soldier reading The Wall Street Journal and asked if I could see it,\" recalls Mr. Baxter. It turned out the other young man -- who remains a friend -- was already playing in the stock market and got Mr. Baxter interested. \"He even helped me get a summer job at a brokerage firm,\" Mr. Baxter says.  Mr. Baxter didn\\'t like retail brokerage work. \"I didn\\'t like trying to sell people. There was a little too much promotion involved,\" he says.  After graduating in 1961 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelor\\'s degree in economics, Mr. Baxter soon went to work for a San Francisco brokerage firm that was involved in the \"third market,\" where listed stocks are traded off the exchange, usually in transactions between institutions.  Interest in that market eventually brought him to Jefferies. Mr. Jefferies is viewed as a pioneer in building the third market. Jefferies accounts for about 60% of third-market trading. This market has been growing in recent years thanks partly to the wave of corporate takeovers, where the third market\\'s ability to execute fast, discreet trades of big blocks of stock is particularly useful.  Though Mr. Baxter, like other officials of the firm, lived in the shadow of the founder, he did have successes of his own, observers say. In 1985, he opened an office for Jefferies in London. \"It opened Feb. 10 and by April it was in the black. I thought that was fantastic,\" says Benjamin L. Lubin, a securities consultant and an outside director for Jefferies.  Mr. Baxter also deserves much of the credit for holding down the firm\\'s costs during a period of rapid growth in recent years, says Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. in New York. \"Though Boyd generated a great deal of business, you make your profits by controlling costs,\" says Mr. Long.  Mr. Baxter says he plans to rely heavily on the 445 employees that make up the Jefferies \"team\" -- a concept that seems to pervade the firm. The firm\\'s colors -- maroon and gold -- and its symbol -- a lion -- adorn coffee mugs and the firm\\'s banner, as well as warm-up jackets, which are hung over the backs of many traders\\' chairs.  The firm also has its own song, which begins \"Jefferies Group, the elite team . . . . \" Mr. Baxter says it\\'s sometimes played in the trading room when a particularly good deal is done.  Mr. Baxter says he is banking on team spirit to help keep traders from leaving now that Mr. Jefferies, whom he describes as the firm\\'s \"spiritual leader\" is gone. \"Even if they aren\\'t loyal to me, I think they will be loyal to each other,\" he says.  Morale is high, he said. After Mr. Jefferies made the announcement of his resignation, there was \"stunned silence and some tears.\" But then, Mr. Baxter adds, \"the team just rose to the occasion. I\\'ve never seen morale higher.\"  Nevertheless, he has taken some quick steps to reassure people and assert his new position. He held a meeting in Dallas over the weekend to review what he termed \"my philosophy and our business plan.\" He says he planned to invite 30 employees of the firm, but got such a response that about 70 went, many paying their own airfare.  As president, Mr. Baxter says, he was deeply involved in forming the firm\\'s business strategy, and doesn\\'t see any need to change it. \"Institutional brokerage is going to remain the engine that drives the firm,\" he says.  But the firm will continue diversifying. Recently it has moved into such areas as trading convertible debentures and stocks of foreign companies. It is still looking to open an office in Asia, probably Tokyo, by the end of the year.  Nor does he believe Mr. Jefferies\\'s transgressions will do lasting damage to the firm. \"Both incidents involved trading positions that were all done by Boyd,\" he says. Mr. Jefferies was charged with manipulating the price of a stock and with helping arbitrager Ivan Boesky hide his ownership of certain stocks by having Jefferies temporarily take ownership.  But it may be some time before Jefferies stops hearing the kind of joke one Wall Street wag offered Friday: \"Jefferies\\'s motto is: Why buy a stock when you can rent it.\" ',\n",

Later, when Micron began to run up big losses because of Japanese price competition in semiconductor sales, it became one of U.S. industry\\'s most strident critics of Japanese trade practices.  Now, however, executives at several Japanese chip companies say that Micron has been secretly exploring the possibility of being acquired by a Japanese company. The executives say representatives of Micron, a Boise, Idaho-based chip manufacturer, held talks last year with at least three Japanese companies, Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and Oki Electric Industry Co., on the subject of a possible purchase of Micron by one of the Japanese concerns. These companies declined to comment on the talks.  Joseph Parkinson, Micron\\'s chairman, denied that he had ever spoken to a Japanese company about a possible takeover, and called reports that Micron has sought a Japanese suitor \"utter baloney.\" \"You can check my passport,\" he said, when asked to comment on a report that he flew to Tokyo last summer for talks with a possible acquirer. However, Mr. Parkinson declined to comment on whether overtures may have been made on Micron\\'s behalf by the company\\'s investment bankers.  According to the Japanese industry sources, Micron representatives held talks with Fujitsu, Hitachi and Oki in Tokyo last summer. The discussions were said to have covered a number of issues, including possible technology-licensing agreements and a potential sale of Micron\\'s assets. The executives said Hitachi dismissed Micron\\'s overtures immediately, and Fujitsu likewise didn\\'t pursue Micron overtures.  Oki, meanwhile, the object of Micron\\'s latest anti-Japanese attack just last week, sent a vice president to Boise within the past six months to meet with Micron\\'s president, Juan Benitez. Mr. Parkinson acknowledges that the Oki executive visited Micron, but denies that the subject of a Micron buyout was seriously discussed. \"The subject didn\\'t come up,\" he said.  Micron, started eight years ago with Idaho potato money on a plot of sand and sagebrush in Boise, has blamed most of its losses over the past two years on Japanese dumping -- selling goods below their production cost. The Japanese agreed in a trade accord signed last summer to open their markets and refrain from chip dumping, but Micron and other chip makers accuse the Japanese of violating the accord, and Micron\\'s losses have only widened. In the company\\'s fiscal second quarter, ended March 5, Micron posted a loss of $10.9 million, compared with a $9.8 million loss in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter totaled $20.1 million, up from $9.4 million a year earlier.  Because of Micron\\'s recent overtures, individuals close to Oki say Oki executives were particularly shocked when Micron last week produced an Oki invoice from a recent chip sale in Hong Kong as evidence of its dumping claims. Micron used the occasion to call on the U.S. government to retaliate against Japanese producers \"before it\\'s too late.\" \"The Japanese response to our administration\\'s good-faith efforts to solve this illegal dumping has been noncompliance and a publicity blitz of denials and statements to confuse and weaken our resolve,\" Mr. Parkinson said.  Micron\\'s steady losses have caused some industry analysts to conclude that the company isn\\'t a long-term survivor, although its officials say it will rebound when it starts production of a new one-megabyte memory chip. Its current problems stand in stark contrast to its initial success as a promising high-tech startup.  That success led author George Gilder, in his 1984 book, The Spirit of Enterprise, to rhapsodize that Micron \"shows once again that the crucial capital of industry is not money or machinery, but mind and spirit, and that America -- in these crucial domains of enterprise -- remains No. 1.\"  --- Brenton R.

But most of Tawain\\'s major banks late last week passed up an opportunity to play a major role in the international loan market.  Chase Manhattan Bank failed to syndicate a loan here for Pertamina, Indonesia\\'s state-owned oil company, as six out of at least eight major Taiwan banks rejected the loan. Pertamina is seeking about $470 million to finance the construction of a liquefied-natural-gas plant, and Chase had hoped to raise at least $240 million of that in Taiwan.  \"The idea was too new, and there was too little time for them to digest\" the loan proposal, said William Liley, managing director of Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd.\\'s project-financing division in Hong Kong. Bankers were given only a month to review the loan proposal.  The major stumbling blocks were inexperience and conservatism. Bankers who declined to support the loan said they have little expertise in project financing and much less in assessing energy markets or Indonesia\\'s credit-worthiness. The bankers\\' conservatism, meanwhile, is based partly on the fact that all major Taiwan banks are either owned or controlled by the government.  \"It\\'s difficult for us to try something new, because we\\'re likely to be penalized for losing the public money but unlikely to be rewarded if we make money for the bank,\" said one banker.  Despite their rejection of this loan, the banks remain open to future opportunities. \"Given another deal, another country, we might consider it. . . .

Ecolab\\'s surprise bid came on the heels of Waste Management\\'s sweetened offer on Friday of $35 a share for ChemLawn. ChemLawn, a Columbus, Ohio, lawn care concern, had been seeking a friendly suitor since it rejected Waste Management\\'s initial $27 a share offer in February.  A Waste Management spokesman yesterday said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste disposal concern wouldn\\'t have any immediate comment on the announcement. Waste Management said only 121 ChemLawn shares had been tendered to it by last Thursday.  The acquisition announcement was made after the markets closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ecolab shares closed at $30.875, down 12.5 cents. In national over-the-counter trading ChemLawn shares rose $1.875 to $36.  In an interview, Pierson M. Grieve, chairman, president and chief executive officer of St. Paul, Minn.-based Ecolab, said his company approached ChemLawn with a friendly offer on Feb. 27, the day after Waste Management made its initial bid. Neither company disclosed Ecolab\\'s interest at the time and ChemLawn said it had instructed its financial advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., to look for other purchasers. Meanwhile, ChemLawn adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to fend off hostile bidders.  In a brief statement Friday, ChemLawn said it had dropped the shareholder rights plan. Mr. Grieve said Ecolab decided to make a pre-emptive offer for ChemLawn before Waste Management raised its bid.  Ecolab\\'s offer is conditioned on the tender of at least 5.3 million ChemLawn shares and gives Ecolab an option to buy all ChemLawn\\'s authorized unissued shares for $36.50 each if there is another higher bid. Mr. Grieve also said holders of 25% of ChemLawn\\'s outstanding shares have agreed to tender them to Ecolab. If the transaction isn\\'t completed, under certain conditions, ChemLawn has agreed to pay Ecolab $20 million.  \"We feel we\\'ve locked it up pretty tight,\" Mr. Grieve said.  Ecolab makes cleaning and sanitizing products for institutions and was formerly known as Economics Laboratory Inc. For its second quarter ended Dec. 31, Ecolab had net income of $10.6 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $421.8 million. Earnings included a $2 million gain from the sale of assets. The company had net income for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1986, of $43.7 million, or $1.62 a share, on sales of $812.9 million.  Mr. Grieve said the ChemLawn acquisition should boost Ecolab\\'s earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year since Ecolab\\'s results will include ChemLawn\\'s seasonally strongest quarter. That benefit is likely to be nearly offset in fiscal 1988 as ChemLawn\\'s full-year results are absorbed, he said.  Meanwhile, ChemLawn said its directors approved severance agreements for senior management, including Jack Van Fossen, chairman and chief executive officer, \"to encourage (managers) to stay with ChemLawn through the transition.\"The agreements provide for lump sum payments equal to 2.99 times a terminated manager\\'s average base pay for the preceding five years  Ecolab said it has arranged financing for the acquisition with Citicorp of New York. Mr. Grieve said Ecolab might sell some assets following the merger to cut its debt load, but he declined to elaborate. Analysts expressed surprise at the size of the Ecolab bid and Mr. Grieve acknowledged the bid was \"a full price.\" But he said Ecolab expects that its sales expertise will help improve ChemLawn\\'s future earnings. \"This wasn\\'t an opportunistic move,\" he said. \"It fulfills our longstanding strategic plan to move into the residential services market.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0003': 'For \\'Politically Motivated\\' View of \\'72 ABM Pact --- By Robert S.           </HL> NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK) AEROSPACE (ARO) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Abraham Sofaer, the State Department\\'s legal adviser and a former federal judge, isn\\'t used to being on the receiving end of harsh verdicts. But recently some senators called his work \"absurd,\" \"illogical\" and \"distorted.\"  Mr. Sofaer is the author of a controversial reinterpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty that would permit wider testing of President Reagan\\'s \"Star Wars\" defense system. Many arms control experts claim his reading is politically motivated and would gut the treaty by contradicting 15 years of established practice under the U.S.-Soviet pact.  The aggressive Mr. Sofaer, who has a strong influence on many foreign policy issues, may be upsetting the delicate balance between his dual roles as the secretary of state\\'s lawyer and the senior U.S. official charged with making sure that foreign policy conforms to international law. Too often, he is perceived as being out in front of the parade, rather than keeping an eye on the procession.  \"I think he\\'s smart, but I also feel he\\'s applying his talents in directions that are not necessarily consistent with what the State Department should be doing,\" says Sen. Carl Levin, a member of the Armed Services Committee. \"I don\\'t view the State Department\\'s position as undermining treaties,\" adds the Michigan Democrat.  Last week, Mr. Sofaer, 48 years old, angered even his supporters by trying to deflect some of the congressional criticism of his interpretation on the Antiballistic Missile Treaty by blaming a young staff lawyer for careless research. The remark angered the White House, which fears Mr. Sofaer may have undercut his interpretation, and prompted some protesting staff members to don yellow stickers saying, \"I am not a young lawyer.\"  Arms control is only one of the issues in which the feisty, 5-foot-4-inch legal adviser is embroiled. Justice Department officials claim that he was too soft on Israel when he headed a task force investigating Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. analyst convicted of spying for Israel. And international lawyers complain that he is on shaky ground when he pushes his hard-line view that the U.S. has the legal right to kidnap suspected terrorists and use force against states that harbor them.  Some experts fear that the result may be that the U.S., once in the forefront of developing international law, now is seen by some other nations as bending statutes to suit its national security goals. They cite such incidents as last year\\'s naval maneuvers near the Gulf of Sidra as a thinly disguised attempt to use international law concerning freedom of navigation as an excuse to provoke Libya into attacking U.S. ships.  \"He has to be not only the advocate, but the legal conscience of the country,\" says Richard Bilder, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and a former attorney in the legal adviser\\'s office. \"Part of his job is reflecting the point of view that international law has its own integrity, and that the long-term interests of the country are best served by a policy of respect for international law. There are some of us who believe he has not done as much as we\\'d like to see in that area.\"  Mr. Sofaer declined to be interviewed for this article.  Delicate and diplomatic are two words that aren\\'t usually associated with Mr. Sofaer. \"He\\'s a very bright fellow, but he has no experience in international law and seems to leap at very radical conclusions based on what looks like superficial research,\" says Alfred Rubin, professor of international law at Tufts University\\'s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  Unlike most of his cautious predecessors, who dispensed behind-the-scenes legal advice to the department\\'s bureaucracy, Abe Sofaer\\'s ingenuity and boundless energy have made him a high-profile foreign policy player and given him direct access to the secretary of state, George Shultz.  Late one evening in October 1985, for instance, Mr. Sofaer was finishing his controversial reinterpretation of the U.S.-Soviet arms control agreement, which was due the next day, when he learned the U.S. had forced down an Egyptian aircraft carrying terrorists who had killed an American. Immediately convening a legal task force to study extradition procedures, he worked through the night, shuttling between both projects and keeping himself and the staff awake by ordering endless rounds of pizza and singing operatic arias in his rich baritone voice. He produced a novel theory of using piracy laws to go after terrorists.  He has some other novel ideas too. Concerning the kidnapping of suspected terrorists, for instance, he once said, \"You might just find a fellow somewhere -- all tied up. He might be sent to a country where we have an effective extradition treaty.\" Wouldn\\'t that be illegal kidnapping? he was asked. \"We\\'re talking about informal civilized arrangements with friends,\" he replied with a smile.  A senior administration official says Mr. Sofaer\\'s views in part are colored by his early months on the job, when he was closely questioned by conservatives because he had been appointed to the bench in New York by President Carter, following a distinguished career as a law professor at Columbia University. He is a member of a slim minority within a minority -- a Jew raised in Bombay, India, by parents of Iraqi origin.  The senior official, who has had many dealings with Mr. Sofaer, says that in conversations, the former judge goes out of his way to support \"the aims of the administration,\" and to \"pepper his conversations with references of support for the president.\"  Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that Mr. Sofaer has brought a new prominence to the tiny legal adviser\\'s office. For example, the bureau, known as \"L\" in the department\\'s bureaucratic parlance, was put in charge when Secretary Shultz set up a task force to provide information to the various agencies and committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal. \"It\\'s the first I can remember us heading anything up,\" says Michael Kozak, a 16-year veteran.  Four days after Mr. Sofaer was appointed to the office, in June 1985, he plunged into his work when hijackers seized a Trans World Airlines jet in the Middle East and killed an American passenger. He quickly saw a way to satisfy the terrorists\\' demand that certain Shiite prisoners in Israel be released. Several years earlier, the U.S. had stated that the prisoners were being held illegally and should be freed, so, Mr. Sofaer reasoned, all the administration had to do was restate its position. He took the idea directly to Mr. Shultz, who agreed.  \"There is a sense of energy and competence in the bureau now,\" adds Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. \"People very much want the legal adviser\\'s views and care what he thinks.\"  Justice Department officials, however, criticize Mr. Sofaer\\'s handling of the Pollard spy case. After he led a joint State-Justice investigating team to Israel in December 1985, he said Jerusalem had been fully cooperative, when, in fact, the Israelis had withheld information from the team. William Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (who recently was selected by President Reagan to take over as director of the Central Intelligence Agency), said Israel had provided only \"selective cooperation.\"  Mr. Sofaer\\'s supporters say Justice officials aren\\'t accustomed to the delicate diplomacy needed when dealing with sovereign states. They assert that Mr. Sofaer\\'s method produced more, not less, cooperation from Israel. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870323-0002': 'IRA Influx to Stocks Shows Mixed Results --- By Pamela Sebastian Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> Individual retirement account (IRA) dollars are helping stoke the continuing stock market rally, but they can also dilute returns for some mutual fund shareholders.  Heavy cash infusions in a soaring market can be a mixed blessing for the many equity fund managers obliged to stay fully invested in stocks. The new cash-in-hand just hasn\\'t had enough time to earn as much as the \"old\" part of the portfolio, weakening the overall return. \"It\\'s an arithmetic question and an arithmetic answer. The smaller the fund the more potential for underperformance,\" says William W. Hewitt, an executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co. New funds -- latecomers in a rising market -- are particularly susceptible.  Just how much IRA money is flowing into the stock market through funds these days is hard to pin down, since hard data lags by several months.  \"January was a huge sales month with some modest shift to equity sales,\" says Al Johnson, chief economist for the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group.  Overall new sales of equity mutual funds (excluding dividend reinvestment)jumped to $6.51 billion in January from $4.97 billion in December, according to the ICI. \"Some of the folks in the trade say the equity funds are getting big play in terms of IRA flows,\" says Mr. Johnson. Nonetheless, the figures through January (a big IRA month) show that bond and income funds account for $3 out of every $4 of sales.  A more recent informal survey of several mutual fund complexes corroborates that ratio, although equity fund sales are growing. It also underscores a huge overall increase in dollars being put into many types of funds, both in IRA and other accounts.  For example, Fidelity Investments says cash levels for its 10 growth funds have hovered at around 5% since yearend. Meanwhile assets in those funds have risen to about $15.59 billion from $11.22 billion. Assets at Fidelity Magellan alone have risen $2.55 billion since yearend. Of course, part of the gains are due to appreciation in stock values.  Some portfolio managers try to offset the crush of cash pouring in during an up market by buying stock-index futures contracts as a temporary proxy for stocks -- a move that allows them to buy time before buying stocks. As they fill in the equities, they sell the futures.  \"You can fine-tune your cash position\" with futures, says M. David Testa, president of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. The concern is seeking the same sort of leeway for its big T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, whose shareholders will soon be asked to approve the fund\\'s use of futures on foreign stock-indexes.  This year, through last Thursday, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund gained 19.46%, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which monitors mutual fund performance. That was just a tad below the 20.43% gain in the Lipper Growth Fund Index for the same period, and not far below the fund\\'s 1986 full-year gain of 21.83%. Meanwhile, fund assets advanced to about $1.60 billion from $1.30 billion at yearend.  Still, Mr. Testa says, \"I don\\'t get real excited if I\\'m ahead or behind\" the short-term market. He notes that the goal of mutual fund investors is longer term.  Just how much of the surge in equity mutual fund sales comes from IRA dollars compared with unrestricted investments isn\\'t clear.  Fidelity says its top-selling funds to IRA accounts during January and February were Magellan, Puritan and Capital Appreciation. Last year they were Magellan, Puritan and Overseas.  At T. Rowe Price, the big IRA winners so far this year are High Yield, Prime Reserve and International Stock, compared with last year\\'s Prime Reserve, High Yield and Ginnie Mae.  Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. says its top IRA sellers are the same for both years: Windsor II, Vanguard GNMA and STAR Fund. Shearson didn\\'t break out IRA accounts, but says its biggest sellers overall this year are Shearson-Lehman Long-Term Government Securities Portfolio, Managed Governments Inc. and Option Income Portfolio.  --- Oppenheimer Management revved up considerable interest last year when it offered a sports car as top prize in a controversial mutual fund sales promotion.  So, who has the keys?  \"Nobody won it,\" says Bridget Macaskill, a senior vice president of the concern, a unit of London-based Mercantile House Holdings PLC.  The contest required exceeding $5 million with a minimum of 10 sales. \"Certain people sold the right (dollar) amount, but not with the right amount of tickets,\" she explains.  Meanwhile, fund regulators pondered whether any further rein on industry incentives was needed. They decided to leave the matter in the hands of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which already had a proposal on its books that would ban non-cash incentives to broker-dealers selling real estate partnerships. The NASD says at the moment it hasn\\'t any similar plans for funds. Currently, funds must disclose any material, non-cash sales incentive in the prospectus.

       " 'WSJ870323-0001': 'With Warrants Convertible Into Stock --- By Frank E. James Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) RETAILING (RET) </IN> C.O.M.B. Co. agreed to buy the half of Cable Value Network that it doesn\\'t already own and to pay for the stake with warrants that can be converted into common stock.  Terms of the agreement in principle call for the 17 cable-television operators who hold the other half of Cable Value Network to receive about eight million warrants. Each warrant would be convertible into one C.O.M.B. share at an exercise price of $18.125 a share. C.O.M.B. currently has about 18.1 million shares outstanding.  The value of the purchase couldn\\'t yet be ascertained. The cost to C.O.M.B., a direct-mail merchandiser, will depend on how much its share price is above that figure when the warrants are exercised; they expire in five years.  In national over-the-counter trading Friday, C.O.M.B. stock closed at $20.25 a share, unchanged.  C.O.M.B.\\'s purchase would give it full control of the fast-growing home-shopping television network and a long-term commitment from the cable operators that they would carry the network.  C.O.M.B.\\'s board also voted to change C.O.M.B.\\'s name to CVN after the purchase.  Among the group of cable-television operators selling the stake are Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation\\'s largest cable operator; Viacom International Inc. of New York; and Warner Communications Inc. of New York.  \"There are a lot of positive benefits to this,\" said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif. \"This is a way of bringing the 50% private portion into a public stock. As long as it was held privately it had no market value.\"  Such a move will help Cable Value fund its rapid growth through the capital markets and give C.O.M.B. full access to the cable operation\\'s cash flow, Mr. Gerbrandt said. Also, the new setup will be more readily managed than the joint venture arrangement, said Mr. Gerbrandt.  Ted Deikel, chairman of C.O.M.B. and Cable Value, said the new arrangement will allow C.O.M.B. to apply its direct-marketing skill to the cable television business.  Cable Value\\'s cable-company investors hope this marketing ability results in new services to woo and keep subscribers. The object is to clearly distinguish Cable Value from Clearwater, Fla.-based Home Shopping Network Inc.  Home Shopping is its biggest and oldest competitor, with $1 billion in annual sales. It has become even more formidable in recent months by branching beyond cable and onto the broadcast airwaves. It appears on UHF stations in some markets, a fact that concerns cable companies as they are charging subscribers for what Home Shopping is now giving away free in some areas.  Formed about a year ago, Cable Value is expected to have annual sales of $350 million to $400 million, said Mr. Deikel. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0206': \"Dixons Names Three To Cyclops's Board Where Seven Resign --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) RETAILING (RET) MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN> Dixons Group PLC, after winning control of Cyclops Corp. Wednesday through a tender offer, is wasting little time taking charge of the Pittsburgh-based company.  London-based Dixons, an electrical appliance retailer, yesterday named three top executives to Cyclops's board and accepted the resignations of seven directors. The changes reduce the number of directors to six from 10.  Named to the board were Egon von Greyerz, Dixons vice chairman and financial director; Gerald M.N. Corbett, corporate finance director; and Geoffrey Budd, secretary.  Resigning from the board were Howard J. Burnett, Thomas Phillips Johnson, H. Frederick Krimendahl II, William E. Lieser, William L. Morbratten, Konrad M. Weis and Howard M. Winterson.  Dixons's changes leave three Cyclops executives on the board, including William H. Knoell, president and chief executive officer. Dixons won the right to name a majority of board members under a merger agreement last month with Cyclops.  As previously reported, Cyclops holders tendered 2.3 million, or 54%, of the 4.3 million shares outstanding, under Dixons's offer to buy all shares for $90.25 each, or $384 million. The offer expired Wednesday. Coupled with Dixons's existing stake, the tender boosted the company's holding to 56%.  In agreeing last month to be acquired by Dixons, Cyclops management rebuffed a competing bid from a group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer. The group, which last week conditionally offered $92.50 a share for Cyclops, has said it may seek to halt Dixons's completion of the merger.  The focus of both suitors is Cyclops's Silo Inc. retailing division, which operates a nationwide chain of appliance and consumer electronics stores. Dixons plans to retain Silo and sell Cyclops's specialty steel and nonresidential construction business. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0205': 'Theater: Edible Props --- By Laurel Graeber</HL> Jan Marasek spent weeks last fall searching for the perfect date. Not to fill lonely hours on Saturday night, but to fill a box for the actors starring in Neil Simon\\'s \"Broadway Bound.\"  \"I had such a hard time,\" says Mr. Marasek, production property master for Emanuel Azenberg, the Broadway show\\'s producer. \"They didn\\'t want pits, they didn\\'t want them coated; the ones from Balducci\\'s and Zabar\\'s were too big to mouth. I finally ended up in a health-food restaurant. I\\'m always looking for dates,\" he says with a sigh.  Like many theatrical property people, Mr. Marasek finds that his role often resembles a cross between a maitre d\\'s and a magician\\'s. Years ago, he says, scripts frequently called for actors to be smoking; now they always seem to be eating. And edible props are seldom to property masters\\' liking. They first have to please the actors, who may have food allergies or dietary restrictions.  \"When Carol Channing was starring in \\'Hello, Dolly!\\' her doctors came backstage to ask what she was eating,\" remembers Mr. Marasek. \"In one scene, she gobbled down dumplings, which were made of spun sugar so she could eat them easily. It turned out we were giving her about a cup of sugar per performance.\" When her physicians demanded an immediate change, Mr. Marasek worked with property man Leo Herbert to produce dumplings made of thin paper sprayed with tea and shaped over small light bulbs to dry. At each performance, Miss Channing would \"eat\" the dumplings and dispose of them discreetly when she wiped her mouth.  Since almost no one would appreciate the same foods eight times a week, property men have devised creative substitutes. Mr. Marasek has made eggs from apricot halves surrounded by white bread lightly sprinkled with boiling water. For the liver in \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" he used pumpernickel, which, creatively shaped with a pizza cutter, also stars as the pot roast in \"Broadway Bound.\"  \"\\'Biloxi Blues\\' has the big mess-hall scene, where the kid hates the food,\" he says of the Neil Simon play, which is now on a national tour. \"When Matthew Broderick starred, he wanted to almost retch when he saw it.\" The concoction was an unappetizing combination of apple butter and green food coloring.  Property masters also worry about safety. Mr. Marasek has been known to sew a loaf of bread together to prevent the cast from tripping over a fallen slice. Eating itself poses a risk to actors, who may swallow more than their lines. \"A dry cookie can be a disaster,\" he says. During tryouts of \"Broadway Bound,\" for example, actor John Randolph caught a seed in his throat from a piece of rye bread. From then on, only seedless loaves were purchased.  Another danger is backstage cooking, which increases the risk of a fire, not to mention the horrifying possibility of a cast felled by food poisoning, or a theater overrun with living things that haven\\'t bought tickets. That\\'s why prop men like to keep edibles to a minimum, and preserve purely decorative foods with shellac.  \"It\\'s good for something with a low moisture content,\" says Edward Gianfrancesco, resident designer at Off Broadway\\'s WPA Theatre. \"But we had a prop person use it once on cheeses and fruits. It was great for a while, except that the varnish became a perfect envelope for everything to turn totally rotten inside.\"  Real food is also expensive. Since the 1985 Broadway opening of Herb Gardner\\'s \"I\\'m Not Rappaport,\" Mr. Herbert\\'s staff has bought approximately 84 heads of lettuce, 84 loaves of bread, 63 pounds of tunafish salad, 42 sticks of butter and 28 jars of mayonnaise just to make one sandwich for each performance. \"Those in the front row have to see that it\\'s tuna,\" says Mr. Herbert. But neither of the actors who has had to taste it has liked tuna, which is why the hidden half of the sandwich is purposely made only with butter. Such grocery costs mount, and although sponsors sometimes ease them by providing coupons or free goods in exchange for a program credit, the arrangement doesn\\'t always suffice.  \"Planter\\'s is giving us cashews for \\'Broadway Bound,\\'\" says Mr. Marasek. \"The cast goes through a pound a show, even though there\\'s only a line about one nut in the script. We don\\'t have the nerve to ask Planter\\'s for all the nuts we use, and they\\'re $5.99 a jar in the supermarket. No one admits to eating them, but,\" he says with determination, \"I\\'m investigating now.\"  To fill a production\\'s gastronomical needs, property masters have gone everywhere from Oriental food shops to caterers. Mr. Marasek once even consulted the Catholic Church to find out what the Host was made of, to see if it would be a viable substitute for the \"Hello, Dolly!\" dumplings. It wasn\\'t.  With so much time, energy and money at stake, property masters prefer artificial food. Mr. Marasek once made a turkey out of plastic-treated felt and cucumber slices out of silicon caulking compound. Liquor is almost never real, as some thieves discovered when they broke into Broadway\\'s Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where Andrew Bergman\\'s \"Social Security\" is playing. What they thought was high-quality Scotch proved to be caramel-colored water.  But although artifice plays a major role in property design, theater professionals strive to make their fake edibles look real. Mr. Marasek usually injects the plastic oranges in \"Broadway Bound\" with water to give them the appropriate weight. Sound is important, too: If an actress throws what is supposedly a tray of frozen fish sticks in a processing plant, they can\\'t sound like styrofoam blocks. This was the problem confronting Mr. Gianfrancesco, who designed the set, complete with styrofoam fish covered with sawdust batter, for the WPA Theatre\\'s recent production of Israel Horovitz\\'s \"North Shore Fish.\" Wood, he reasoned, was too heavy a substitute and a potential danger to the actors.  \"For that particular scene, we made a batch out of Homosote, which is like a very dense cardboard,\" he explains. \"That tray had to come out in just the proper sequence for her to hurl it and get the sound.\"  There is, however, one area in which no one seeks authenticity.  \"You don\\'t want the audience to start smelling food cooking,\" warns Mr. Marasek, \"or they\\'ll all want to walk out to the nearest restaurant and eat.\"  --- Ms. Graeber is a New York-based freelance writer.

       " 'WSJ870320-0204': 'Geriatrics Observed: Hubris and Humor --- By Hilton Kramer</HL> Kingsley Amis, who turns 65 this year, is the finest comic novelist England has produced since Evelyn Waugh. Like Mr. Waugh, he is often said to be a reactionary in his social views, and the charge is not unfounded. Certainly he takes a very mordant view of what are now the standard liberal pieties. Socialism, feminism and the emancipated culture and life styles of the educated middle class -- about these and other phenomena sacred to the liberal mind, Mr. Amis clearly feels a deep revulsion.  He isn\\'t shy about expressing it, either. On the contrary, he is relentless, hilarious and devastating. It was not to be expected, therefore, that he would be easily forgiven by those who are the butt of his jokes, and he hasn\\'t been. His last novel, \"Stanley and the Women,\" was so reviled, especially by feminists, that it met with some difficulty in finding an American publisher.  With his new novel, however, even Mr. Amis\\'s most implacable liberal critics have been persuaded to suspend hostilities. It is not that \"The Old Devils\" (Summit, 294 pages, $16.95) represents any fundamental change in Mr. Amis\\'s attitudes toward human nature or modern society or anything else. Far from it. \"The Old Devils\" is in some respects the grimmest novel Mr. Amis has yet written. Moreover, its humor, though at times uproarious, is not the kind that mitigates the author\\'s disabused view of the human condition. The laughter in this book, as in others by Mr. Amis, leaves a bitter aftertaste.  What has changed is Mr. Amis\\'s subject. In \"The Old Devils\" he is now writing about the onset of old age -- not only its physical debilities and social humiliations but its moral illuminations, too -- and writing about this condition from the inside. The result is a book that is so vivid, so original, so understanding and so wise, that it is likely to become -- at least for those with the stomach to face its dour implications -- a classic among novels dealing with old age, and a comic classic at that.  The story is set in a small coastal town in South Wales in the 1980s. The old devils of the title are a group of mostly retired middle-class sexagenarians and their wives who have long lived in the same community and know just about everything there is to know about each other. Some of the men once had literary or at least academic ambitions, but now daily life for this circle of aging friends is a more or less settled routine bounded by the local pub (for the men) and get-togethers in each other\\'s houses (for the women), where quantities of drink -- whiskey for the men, wine for the women -- keep them in a state of perpetual inebriate civility.  Their marriages, though mostly surviving, are in various states of disrepair, and likewise their health -- though only in Wales, perhaps, could geriatric medicine be expected to smile quite so benignly upon such Gargantuan intakes of alcohol as are described in this novel. However placid the surface routine of their lives may be, the minds of these characters are nonetheless awash with sundry regrets, recriminations, and guilt, mostly having to do with the erotic misadventures of their youth, which it is the function of the steady drinking, of course, to assuage and tranquilize.  This it generally succeeds in doing -- until, that is, the crisis that is visited upon them by the return to their midst of the glamorous couple, Alun and Rhiannon Weaver, who have long occupied a special place in their erotic reveries. Alun Weaver is a handsome television personality who, after a moderately successful but now declining career as a professional (which is to say, a phony) Welshman in London, has returned to Wales in the hope of reviving his sagging fortunes on native ground. Like his still-beautiful wife Rhiannon, he is also the lost love of several of these characters, who prove to be as eager as ever to succumb to his charms.  Unlike Rhiannon, however, who proves to be the most appealing woman Mr. Amis has ever created in his fiction, Alun is a complete rogue, and it is his callous behavior toward just about everyone in this old circle of friends -- not only the women -- that precipitates the climactic events of the story.  Make no mistake: \"The Old Devils\" is a harsh, caustic, unremitting tale of disappointed hopes, aggravated memories and sublimated passions. Yet it has a happy ending of the sort we have a right to expect from a true comedy. Mr. Amis never averts his glance from the wreckage of mind and body that age brings in its wake, but in the end he strikes a surprising and persuasive note of forbearance. And along the way in this flawlessly constructed tale he springs so many other surprises and reversals of sympathy and understanding that we are never in any doubt about the fact that we are in the presence of a master storyteller who has faced the worst and somehow come to terms with it.  --- Mr. Kramer is editor of The New Criterion.

       " 'WSJ870320-0203': 'Tidbits From Spring Training --- By Frederick C. Klein</HL> Every year, when I return from baseball spring training, people ask me what I saw that I liked. Every year I answer \"spring training.\"  The institution, not its component teams or parks, gets me every time, and the reasons have nothing to do with any dewy stuff about hope springing eternal in my ball-fan\\'s breast. I like the feeling of being in warm sunshine when two-thirds of my fellow citizens are walking around wearing mittens. I like watching baseball from close range with the smell of suntan lotion in my nostrils. I like the good nature of the crowds at contests in which playing, not winning or losing, usually takes precedence.  The word on spring training is getting around. Last year\\'s attendance on the Florida and Arizona circuits set a record, and if the three sellouts in the five games I witnessed last week are any guide, this year\\'s will set another. That\\'s a dangerous trend, especially here in East Coast Florida, where the stone crab population is said to be dwindling. It held up well enough this month, though. So did the usual, ample stock of training-camp tidbits:  Monday, March 2 -- It\\'s picture day at the New York Yankees camp here. Almost two dozen photogs turn as one and blaze away when Billy Martin, the Yanks\\' once and -- who knows? -- maybe future manager appears in the team\\'s dugout, resplendent in tan shirt and slacks and snakeskin cowboy boots.  Martin is back for a second year as a Yankees\\' TV broadcaster. He hopes to do color commentary during games instead of the pre- and post-game assignments he drew last season. \"Last year they gave me only a minute to talk sometimes,\" he snorts. \"What can you say in a minute?\"  Tuesday, March 3 -- Tom Lasorda, the Los Angeles Dodgers\\' manager, likes to lecture his players. His topic this day at Vero Beach is base running.  \"I coached third base in the Majors, minors and winter leagues, and I knew how fast every one of my players could run,\" he said. \"If I waved a guy from first to third on a hit, or from second to home, I expected him to make it. My man Joey {Amalfitano, the Dodgers\\' present third-base coach} expects the same. If you get thrown out, the fans\\'ll boo him, but when you get back to the dugout, I\\'ll boo you.\"  Sunday, March 8 -- The Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos, arguably the two worst teams in the National League, meet in their common spring home of West Palm Beach. There seems to be a lot of applause, but really it\\'s people swatting black \"Florida bugs.\" The biggest cheer of the afternoon goes to this announcement over the public-address system: \"To the owner of a gold Oldsmobile: You are blocking traffic, your doors are locked, your key is in the ignition . . . and your motor is running.\"  Monday, March 9 -- The Yankees play the Minnesota Twins at night in Fort Lauderdale before a full house of 6,793. It\\'s the toughest crowd of my spring stay, by far. A young man sitting behind me, wearing a Yankee T-shirt, boos such Yankee stalwarts as Don Mattingly, Dave Winfield and Dave Righetti. When I ask him why, he replies that Mattingly and Winfield make too much money to suit him. I didn\\'t have to ask about Righetti; he\\'d just given up a three-run, ninth-inning home run to pinchhitter Tim Laudner that sunk the Yanks, 54.  Even a white-haired vendor wasn\\'t immune from criticism. When he handed an 85-cent bag of peanuts to a man down my row, the guy told him that in Yankee Stadium, the vendors flipped the bags behind their backs. \"For $2 a bag, I\\'d flip \\'em, too,\" the vendor snapped. (Actually, peanuts at Yankee Stadium sell for a mere 80 cents a bag.)  Tuesday, March 10 -- Another SRO throng is on hand to watch the Expos play the American League champion Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have a long drive back to their base at Winter Haven, and stipulate that they will not hang around for extra innings. Wouldn\\'t you know it? The game ends in an 8-8 tie with sunlight aplenty remaining.  Wednesday, March 11 -- The Texas Rangers travel to Miami from their new stadium at Port Charlotte to play the Baltimore Orioles in a night game. Attendance is sparse at the inner-city stadium, underlining speculation that the O\\'s may seek spiffier digs one day.  Not long ago, the Orioles\\' farm system was the envy of the Majors, but no more. Six members of the team\\'s starting lineup this night are new or recent acquisitions. They are Alan Wiggins (an ex-Padre), Rick Burleson (Angels), Fred Lynn (Angels), Ray Knight (Mets), Terry Kennedy (Padres) and Mike Hart (Twins). The youngest are Wiggins and Hart, both aged 29.  The O\\'s 73-89 record last season was their first losing campaign since 1967, and a pitching slump was a major cause.

Friday, March 13 -- The Dodgers are another team that fell on hard times last year, limping in fifth in the National League West. Their biggest problem was bum fielding, their 181 errors being a dubious Major League \"most.\"  It is doubtful, however, if the 1986 team botched an inning as badly as the present one did the second against the New York Mets here today before a packed Holman Field: a walk, a balk, a wild pitch and two infield errors, plus a single, produced three Met runs.  Compounding the felony was a P.A. announcement following this disastrous frame. It plugged an instructional video by Manager Lasorda and his boys titled \"The Dodger Way to Play Baseball.\" The Dodgers might not have their timing down yet, but that fella sure does. ',\n",

President Carter\\'s statements on release of frozen Iranian assets -- including arms already bought but undelivered -- were entirely public. Moreover, there was to be no delivery of any assets until all hostages had been safely released. By contrast, President Reagan sold new arms that he delivered deviously and in total secrecy -- before hostages were released.  You observe that the Ayatollah Khomeini \"never bothered\" to respond to President Carter\\'s public proposal. Quite true. He did, however, respond eagerly to President Reagan\\'s secret proffer -- retaining hostages, of course, for future trading purposes.

The company had after-tax earnings equivalent to $52.9 million, at current exchange rates, down 87% from $405.2 million in 1985. But an extraordinary charge of $80.1 million resulted in a net loss of $27.2 million for 1986.

Britoil's revenue last year fell 46%, to $1.57 billion from $2.88 billion. The company attributed its lower after-tax earnings and revenue to the drop in oil prices.

       " 'WSJ870320-0194': \"The Feb. 26 page-one article on Louisiana education left the impression that business was shunning the state. That's not so. In 1986 business investment in Louisiana totaled more than $2.9 billion. Nearly $1 billion in new investment has already been announced for 1987. Investment in manufacturing over the past 10 years is more than $20 billion.  Despite the article's comments to the contrary, Louisiana workers in 1986 were deemed good enough by Boeing to locate a major facility in southwest Louisiana that will employ 1,400. And Martin Marietta has selected New Orleans as the site at which it will fabricate modules for the space station if it is the successful bidder on that project. Also, in the past few weeks Rockwell International has announced plans to move one of its electronics subsidiaries from Texas to northwest Louisiana.  As to workers of Cajun descent, they are capable enough and motivated enough to hold the bulk of the jobs in the offshore oil-exploration industry where the average wage approaches $30,000 a year. In addition, it was a task force of several thousand Cajuns that helped establish the offshore oil and gas industry in the North Sea, as they had done earlier in the Gulf of Mexico.  We in Louisiana are aware of the importance of education. It is the reason the state allocates nearly one of every three tax dollars to support our schools. It is also the reason we created a $2 billion trust fund for education -- the largest fund of its kind in the U.S. -- and have already deposited the first half-billion in the program.  We know more has to be done, but we aren't alone in our concern. Some 20 other states have also declared education to be the number one priority. This is not an isolated problem and certainly not one unique to Louisiana. Rather it is the result of a long-term decline in American education. In view of the pervasiveness of the problem, I don't know why Louisiana was singled out for your article, but I do know that we are one state that is attempting to do something about it.  Edwin Edwards Governor of Louisiana Baton Rouge --- The oil companies came in with the big bucks. The people and politicians of Louisiana fell for it. No matter how good the education system is, if students don't want to learn, nothing can change it.  The problems started when the oil-field jobs replaced education as the most important part of our lives. During the rise of oil, people quit school. There was no need for education when one could earn $25,000 to $50,000 a year in the oil field. Now the uneducated parents of our state cannot help their children with third-grade schoolwork.  As a graduate of the Louisiana school system, I got out of it what I put into it. It was up to me if I wanted an education.  Mr. Elliman of Lucas CAV Ltd. states that Louisiana doesn't have employees with the basic skills needed to adapt to change.

       " 'WSJ870320-0193': 'Wright Is Wrong</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> House Speaker James Wright\\'s proposal to tax security transactions (news story, March 3) is an inefficient and dangerous way to reduce the federal deficit.  Rep. Wright fails to see that a substantial amount of funds in the equity markets is controlled by labor-backed pension funds, as well as monies invested on behalf of middle-class Americans via mutual funds. A tax on publicly traded stocks would make these instruments less attractive than other securities. Wealthy investors would choose to stay away from publicly traded domestic equities in favor of other investments. It is the middle-class, small investors who would bear a disproportionate amount of this tax, as they lack access to more sophisticated investments.  Derivative products, such as futures and options, would become more attractive. An investor who wished to put his money in NYSE stocks would find it more efficient to do so by taking long positions in index futures or synthetic positions built with options. Open interest in these instruments would increase, thereby levering up our already debt-ridden nation.  If we want to avoid abuses on Wall Street, we must deal with this problem directly. If we wish to reduce the deficit, we must control government excess and waste. Rep. Wright has found an industry that is currently politically vulnerable, and has decided to harness it to the burdens of a deficit that it did not directly produce.  Leonard A. Blum Los Angeles --- I applaud Speaker Wright\\'s proposal. After all, the U.S. has a major deficit problem, and it\\'s clear that everyone on Wall Street is an insider trader and deserves to be punished.  Since this transfer tax would not by itself solve the deficit problem, I suggest we try to think of other industries that are candidates for extra disciplinary taxes. The ideal candidates are industries where the actions of some notable participants have proved that their entire industry is corrupt.  How about pizza parlors? The recent \"Pizza Connection\" trial has proved that all pizza parlors are really just fronts for illegal drug activity. I propose an extra $2 tax on every pizza sold (50 cents each for individual slices).  Of course, some people might claim that much, if not all, of the disciplinary taxes are likely to be passed through to the innocent end consumer (investors in the first case, pizza lovers in the second), but I say we have to punish these corrupt industries, even if the methods are somewhat inefficient.  We need some more candidates. How about politicians? Recent trials in New York City proved that all politicans are crooks. An extra tax on politicians seems appropriate and is consistent with this new enlightened policy of disciplinary taxation. Politicians . . . Oops! You better be careful, Jim.  Gordon Cliff New York --- I find the idea shocking and unjustified. General government services should be financed by the income tax. Our private sector is already in serious economic condition as a result of state and local governments\\' conversion of private property through the sales tax, property taxes on land, improvements and equipment, and extortionate building-permit fees.  R.L. Middleton Pismo Beach, Calif. --- In the interests of punishing Wall Street for past sins, Mr. Wright proposes to tax pensions, IRAs, Keogh Plans, life-insurance policies and all other forms of retirement income that invest in publicly traded stocks.  David Stockman was right. Jim Wright is a snake-oil salesman who practices the politics of envy.  David C.P.

       " 'WSJ870320-0192': 'Toshiba Official Finds Giving Work to Firms In U.S. Can Be Tricky --- Hisao Tanaka Says Japanese Often Demur, Americans Balk at Picky Purchasers --- But Contracts Are Increasing --- By William M. Bulkeley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN> Toshiba Corp. makes more than one million microwave ovens a year in Japan. This year, if Hisao Tanaka prevails, some 60,000 will be powered by American-made capacitors, and the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan will be some $120,000 narrower.  For Mr. Tanaka, a veteran Toshiba manager who works out of an office park in this Boston suburb, persuading his Tokyo colleagues to buy U.S. parts for microwave ovens would be a small but important victory. In the past, Toshiba\\'s engineers have resisted substituting American for Japanese parts.  As Toshiba\\'s head buyer in the U.S., Mr. Tanaka is heavily engaged in Japan\\'s latest trade war. His mission: to buy American. At times, though, it seems like mission impossible. Japan\\'s imports of U.S. goods have indeed increased since Toshiba and other big Japanese companies began a much-publicized buy-American campaign in 1985, but the gains haven\\'t come easily, and the trade deficit has grown, not shrunk.  Mr. Tanaka partly blames U.S. companies. All too often, he laments, they seem to go out of their way not to sell to Toshiba. They decline to bid on contracts that don\\'t offer an immediate profit, refuse to provide the prompt service that Toshiba expects and occasionally insult the Japanese company -- a diversified multinational with $18.74 billion in sales last year -- by demanding cash on delivery. \"I don\\'t think they\\'d insist with General Electric,\" he says pointedly.  Some U.S. companies, on the other hand, question whether Toshiba is serious about buying American. A request for information by Mr. Tanaka was \"a fishing expedition, and nothing happened after that,\" says Linda Saul, an administrator at a computerized-design company\\'s sales office down the hall from him.  Mr. Tanaka concedes that out of every 10 U.S. companies he talks with, only one ends up doing business with Toshiba. And he acknowledges that some of his colleagues back in Japan aren\\'t deeply committed to buying American. \"It takes time to buy a new product -- especially from outside Japan. Nobody wants to take the risk of changing suppliers,\" he explains.  So, despite the dollar\\'s two-year, 40% decline against the yen -- which makes American goods cheaper in Japan -- the U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains huge. Although Japan\\'s imports of U.S. goods rose 19%, to $26.88 billion, last year, its exports to the U.S. also rose 19%, to $81.91 billion. As a result, the merchandise-trade deficit grew to $55.03 billion from $46.15 billion in 1985.  Some economists contend that it is just a matter of time until the higher yen makes U.S. goods so cheap the Japanese will buy them. \"We are all disappointed that American exports haven\\'t picked up as we expected,\" says Hugh Patrick, an economist at Columbia University. \"But the things we tend to export are industrial products -- and it certainly takes time to generate contracts and start making sales.\"  A look at Mr. Tanaka\\'s frustrations shows just how hard this can be. Many cultural and corporate differences impede U.S. sales to Japan, no matter how interested both sides claim to be.  Mr. Tanaka insists that Toshiba is clearly committed to buying American. The company opened its procurement office here last fall (another one, its first, is in San Francisco), doubled the number of buyers in America to eight and tripled its total U.S. procurement-office budget to $1 million a year.  Each day, Toshiba\\'s U.S. buyers get a stream of facsimile messages from Tokyo asking them to find potential vendors, get price quotes or track down delayed orders. Occasionally, Mr. Tanaka, who will soon be transferred to Toshiba\\'s international procurement operation in Tokyo, seeks more U.S. suppliers by going to trade shows and collecting catalogs or even by knocking on nearby doors.  The extra effort, he says, is starting to pay off. This year, Toshiba expects to place orders with 300 to 350 U.S. companies, up from about 200 in 1984. A GE-type conglomerate, Toshiba buys lots of things from the U.S.: semiconductors from Motorola Inc., work stations from Sun Microsystems Inc., automatic testing equipment from Teradyne Inc.  Last year, Mr. Tanaka supervised the purchase of $46 million of U.S. goods, up 53% from 1985. To help Toshiba increase its imports, Mr. Tanaka is even suggesting that it buy U.S. golf balls to sell to its 60,000 Japanese workers. \"We must show them the enjoyment of a higher exchange rate,\" he says. (Mr. Tanaka himself purchases lots of U.S. beef, but he avoids the American-Japanese car wars -- he drives a German Audi.) All told, Toshiba expects to import some $520 million in goods from around the world in its fiscal year ending March 31, with most of that being purchased through trading companies or offices of foreign companies in Japan. About 70% of its imports come from the U.S.  Nevertheless, building American purchases is slow work, says Mr. Tanaka, who puts in a 13-hour day in order to talk with executives in Japan between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern time. \"It took almost a year to train our employees to buy foreign products,\" he says.  Today, says Mr. Tanaka, a chain-smoking, coffee-gulping 36-year-old with a midfive-figure salary: \"If the conditions on buying U.S. goods are the same as from Japanese companies, Toshiba policy is to buy from America. Two years ago, we would have bought Japanese.\"  For example, he found that a Toshiba microwave-oven plant in Nashville, Tenn., was satisfied with capacitors that it bought from Aerovox Corp., an RTE Corp. subsidiary based in New Bedford, Mass. He persuaded the oven makers in Japan to test Aerovox capacitors last year and now is negotiating a small contract to send 5,000 to 10,000 of them there. If they work well, he says, Toshiba will place a regular order, and Aerovox could end up shipping capacitors to a Toshiba microwave plant in England as well.  At Aerovox, a major U.S. maker of microwave-oven capacitors, John A. Churma, its vice president for sales and manufacturing, says he was surprised when Mr. Tanaka approached him about exporting to Japan. \"We\\'d been romancing Toshiba {in Nashville} for about six years\" before big sales started in 1986, he says. \"I thought the Japanese market would be tougher to crack because of their entrenched manufacturing capabilities.\"  Mr. Tanaka can cite other successes. Late last year, as the yen rose, Toshiba took the unusual step of replacing its Japanese supplier of hard disk drives for computers with Memorex Corp., of Milpitas, Calif., and Kaitex Media Inc., of San Jose, Calif. Emboldened, Mr. Tanaka recently persuaded a top Japanese engineer to evaluate analog-digital converters made by Analogic Corp., of Peabody, Mass., even though Toshiba itself makes similar parts.  As Mr. Tanaka sees it, however, American vendors don\\'t compete effectively with the Japanese. They don\\'t treat Toshiba with the eager deference that he expects. \"In the U.S., they say the customer is king. In Japan, the customer is God,\" he says. Most U.S. companies get business only if Toshiba decides to buy American -- not by outselling a Japanese supplier.  Mr. Tanaka also suspects that many U.S. companies really don\\'t want to export. He notes that few write technical brochures in Japanese and that many haven\\'t mastered high-tech export-licensing requirements. Vernon Alden, a director of several U.S. corporations, comments, \"I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to blame the Japanese because they expect to have better service than we give. The problem is we have gotten sloppy.\"  Mr. Tanaka complains that some U.S. companies take six weeks to provide price quotes even on standard products. One concern refused to promise a delivery date until Toshiba placed the order -- a troublesome stand because Toshiba\\'s Japanese plants keep inventories lean.  Last winter, a General Electric Co. transformer plant in Hickory, N.C., said it couldn\\'t ship a small order when Toshiba demanded it. Mr. Tanaka asked to visit the GE factory to learn the reason. He says GE\\'s reply was: If Toshiba left it alone, half the order would be shipped in a week; if Toshiba officials visited, it wouldn\\'t be shipped at all. \"This is 180 degrees opposite of Japan,\" he says. \"They just don\\'t want to hear our complaint.\"  A GE spokesman says the company quoted the same delivery times to all customers. He adds, \"We got people to work overtime over Thanksgiving\" to ship part of Toshiba\\'s order early. But when Mr. Tanaka asked to visit, \"We said, \\'Please don\\'t. It might cause a problem just having additional people be there.\\'\"  Mr. Tanaka says a supplier that he won\\'t name promised a circuit breaker with a special calibration but filled the $20,000 order with its standard model. Toshiba complained. The supplier said it would take six weeks to recalibrate. Instead, it offered to tell Toshiba engineers how to do the job. Desperate for the part, Toshiba agreed. But when its engineers asked for clarification of the instructions, Mr. Tanaka says, \"The U.S. engineers complained we were wasting their time. They said we weren\\'t an important enough customer.\"  To U.S. companies, Toshiba can seem picky and imperious. Analogic was proud when all 100 electronic instruments worked in its first shipment to Toshiba seven years ago. But Toshiba complained because some minor parts came loose. \"We thought we\\'d performed a miracle. But they sat there and told me how inferior our products were,\" recalls Bernard Gordon, Analogic\\'s president. Today, the companies\\' engineers meet quarterly in Tokyo and Peabody. \"Their expectations of perfection rubbed off on us,\" Mr. Gordon says. Toshiba\\'s orders to Analogic now run $5 million a year.  When Toshiba ordered a three-ton industrial burner from tiny Pyronics Inc. of Cleveland last year, Mr. Tanaka negotiated visitation rights during the 16-week building process. Moreover, says Nicholas LaGamba, a Pyronics engineer: \"They demanded a manufacturing schedule from us showing graphically just where we\\'d be at each stage of production.\" That technique was new to Pyronics; so Mr. Tanaka taught the company how to do it.  Nonetheless, Mr. Tanaka complains that many U.S. suppliers won\\'t invest the effort to fulfill Toshiba\\'s expectations.  Mr. Tanaka is particularly frustrated by their reluctance to bid on projects that won\\'t bring in revenue for several years. For example, his office is charged with finding U.S. vendors for a fuel-cell power-plant project, but getting bidders has been a grind. \"They will cooperate and take instant business, but they aren\\'t cooperating in future business,\" he says. He adds that small Japanese companies would eagerly do engineering work to bid on Toshiba projects but that American companies must be cajoled to do so.  One reason American vendors are cautious is the limited market for power from fuel cells, which efficiently turn chemical energy into electricity. Lee Ridenour, the Toshiba buyer seeking bidders for the fuel-cell project, says, \"One thing that is scarce in the U.S. is quotation time and engineering time.\" Toshiba engineers in Japan, drawing up the bid requests, \"were in a climate where they could ask suppliers to do work without pay,\" she adds. She says one U.S. engineer termed a 20-page request requiring about 100 pages of specifications and drawings \"the Toshiba torture test.\"  And U.S. bidders say they are amazed by the study that Toshiba puts into each bid. Harry G. Abel, a power-industry specialist at Foxboro Co., a controls maker in Foxboro, Mass., says teams of six engineers went to Foxboro twice and also met with him in San Francisco.  \"American engineers tend to spread themselves out over 10 or 12 projects,\" Mr. Abel says, but the Japanese \"were dedicated to this.\" After all the work, Foxboro lost the contract to another U.S. company, he says. However, he hopes to get Toshiba business in the future. ',\n",

Wall Street Pros --- By Bryan Burrough</HL> Alan gaines knows he\\'s the type of Wall Streeter that chief executive officers love to hate. He\\'s the fast-talking head of an investment firm, lives in a Park Avenue townhouse, drives a Rolls-Royce and earns more than $1 million a year.  He also doesn\\'t hesitate to tell America\\'s CEOs how to do their jobs.  Two years ago, the youthful Mr. Gaines flew to Houston to tell Tenneco Inc.\\'s silver-haired chief executive, 56-year-old James Ketelson, to restructure the $15 billion oil conglomerate or risk a takeover.  \"I walk into his office in Houston and Ketelson is like Mr. WASP, Mr. Proper. And here I am, a 32-year-old kid making more money than he does, telling him how to run his company. What would your reaction be?\"  Neither Mr. Ketelson nor Tenneco will comment, but Mr. Gaines says the advice was spurned. Not that he was surprised. He\\'s used to what he calls the \"anti-investment banker, anti-New York, anti-little rich kid\" attitude of big-company executives.  He in turn sometimes holds a disdainful view of Main Street.\"You go out to visit these CEOs who talk very slow, very deliberate. \\'Well, sir-r-r, we\\'re ve-ry interested in long-term valuuuue,\\'\" mimics Mr. Gaines, the head of Gaines Berland Co. \"I want to say, \\'Come on, guy, spit it out. Talk. I want to get home by next year.\\'\"  Main Street and Wall Street have always been miles apart. But the takeover fever of recent years, which has thrown together conservative corporate executives and a new breed of young, highly paid raiders and investment bankers, is driving the two cultures still further apart. The result is a symbiotic relationship often marked by deep clashes in everything from how they make deals and what they wear when making them, to how they spend their money.  \"We have created a monster,\" declares Fred Zuckerman, Chrysler Corp.\\'s treasurer. \"Main Street management believes that greed has finally won out. Executives hate the takeover folks, whom they view as having no useful purpose. They think even less of the investment bankers. It\\'s genuine revulsion at a society that rewards people so greatly for work they perceive to be so unproductive.\"  The recent headline-grabbing spate of insider trading scandals only has widened the chasm. \"There is a definite tension between corporate types and Wall Streeters,\" says Jonathan Rinehart, whose New York-based public relations consulting firm specializes in takeover-style crises, \"and all this insider trading stuff is just dumping gasoline on the fire.\"  A recent example is the lawsuit by Staley Continental Inc., a food company, alleging that the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. tried to pressure Staley management into a leveraged buyout. Drexel has called the allegation \"totally without merit\" and said the suit is \"an ill-conceived attempt to capitalize on the current climate\" created by the spate of insider-trading arrests.  These days even investment bankers fear Wall Street\\'s young Frankensteins. \"I find the whipper-snapper investment banker who\\'s fresh from Harvard Business School and who\\'s going to tell you how to run your company, just as tiresome as any other CEO,\" says Robert S Pirie, president and chief executive of Rothschild Inc. \"These smart-aleck kids who have gotten bagged (for insider-trading violations) ought to go to jail for more than a year,\" he says. \"Minus their toenails.\"  Along Main Street, here\\'s how David Culver, 51-year-old former CEO of Amarillo, Texas-based Pioneer Corp., views Wall Street types:  \"I\\'m sick of \\'em all,\" he says. Mr. Culver developed his hostility last year when he sold out to crosstown buddy T. Boone Pickens after being overwhelmed by a phalanx of raiders and investment bankers.  Mr. Culver complains that in boardroom jousts his Wall Street opponents were so single-minded as to appear \"programmed.\"  \"First of all, they\\'re not a damn bit smarter than me, no matter what they think,\" says Mr. Culver. Even more disturbing to him, the Wall Streeters seem concerned with little beyond money and their careers. \"Our guys are much more family-oriented. They look forward to going home and playing with their children,\" Mr. Culver says.  \"I was president of the Amarillo Club, in the United Way and Rotary,\" he continues. \"We consider that important. When the Wall Streeter finally gets home, he\\'s lucky to see his family, much less go down to the United Way and make calls.\"  It\\'s still unclear where all the resentment will lead. But it could trigger a grassroots backlash of the type that toppled another generation of financiers: the robber barons. Politicians are already on the scent. \"If you did to a 7-Eleven what (Wall Streeters) have done to the American economy, you\\'d be doing 20-to-life,\" said James Hightower, outspoken Texas agriculture commissioner, in a recent speech before national Democratic leaders.  Much of this boils down to simple difference in executive style. To the typical Main Street executive, Wall Streeters are fresh-faced MBAs in tailored suits and mallard-dotted suspenders who come to places like Bartlesville, Okla., and Akron, Ohio, only to put people out of work -- all the while mouthing terms like \"break-up values\" and \"front-end loaded, two-tier tender offers.\"  In turn, many Wall Streeters seem to view their Main Street counterparts as slow-moving, boorish hicks. \"The so-called sophisticates tend to be surprised when they find smart guys out there in the hinterlands,\" says Gary Hirsch, a 37-year-old principal in the New York investment firm of Miller, Tabak &amp; Hirsch. \"They\\'ll walk out of meetings and say, \\'Gee, even though this guy is from Pennsylvania, he knows what he\\'s doing.\\'\"  Still, when Wall Streeters venture down Main Street, sometimes they feel like they\\'re in a foreign country. During the unsuccessful visit to Tenneco\\'s chief executive, Mr. Gaines found himself lunching \"at some place with animal heads on the walls. It was like eating in the Baptist Club of Houston. I expected to have to say grace before sitting down. I mean, in New York I take people to Le Cirque,\" he says, referring to the famed French restaurant.  The difference in lunch style, though, often pales before the difference in lifestyle. Case in point is last November\\'s visit by Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\\'s 62-year-old chief executive, to the Manhattan townhouse of Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French investor who then was trying to grab the Akron-based tiremaker.  According to a Goodyear associate, Mr. Mercer was taken aback when he knocked at what he thought was the correct address, only to be told by a smartly dressed butler that Sir James lived several doors down. Knocking there, the same butler opened the door, explaining to Mr. Mercer: \"This is Mr. Goldsmith\\'s home. That was the kitchen.\"  Once inside, the father of five found himself facing two statues of nude females and a myriad of paintings of nudes. Mr. Mercer, an associate says, hasn\\'t yet tired of relating his amazement.  But it is in the boardroom where matters of style matter most. Nowhere was that more apparent than at Phillips Petroleum Co. in 1984, when Wall Street specialists arrived to help the Bartlesville oil company fend off a Who\\'s Who of corporate raiders.  Phillips CEO William Douce and other officials occasionally would roll their eyes after lecture-like presentations by the investment bankers. Says Mr. Douce, now retired: \"I don\\'t mind those young people making a lot of money in a short time. But some of \\'em speak as if they were God. Some of \\'em think they may be God. I\\'ll tell you a secret. Most of those fellows come in, listen to you and your people. Then they take your own ideas, dress \\'em up a little and read \\'em back to you.\"  Down in the Phillips public relations department, employees were equally put off by the New York firm hired by senior executives hired to manage the company\\'s media campaign. Although a Phillips spokesman denies it, a person close to the company says the two sides fought over practically every word of every press release, at times to the brink of fistfights.  \"There was the perception that the New Yorkers thought they had come down here to help the Great Unwashed,\" says a Phillips official. \"Just because we don\\'t eat at Tavern on the Green doesn\\'t make us any less sophisticated.\"  When the culture clash between adversaries surfaces, it is enough to bring a heated takeover battle to a boil. That apparently was the case when, during Pennzoil Co.\\'s unsuccessful bid to acquire Getty Oil Co., Pennzoil\\'s tough-talking chief executive, J. Hugh Liedtke, was host to Jay Higgins, then a 38-year-old Salomon Brothers investment banker who represented the Getty Museum, a major Getty Oil shareholder.  Mr. Liedtke asked several anxious questions about the museum\\'s position on the pending merger, but Mr. Higgins kept silent, Pennzoil lawyer Arthur Liman recalled in recent court testimony. Suddenly, Mr. Higgins answered all at once: \"Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir.\"  Mr. Liman, seeing his boss near explosion, quickly escorted the investment banker from the room. \"Mr. Higgins did a number on Mr. Liedtke . . . a mocking of him. I just wanted to get him out of there,\" Mr. Liman testified.  Mr. Higgins, currently head of corporate finance at Salomon, denies mocking Mr. Liedtke. He says he wasn\\'t entirely responsive to the executive because, at the time, he didn\\'t want to divulge to Pennzoil the Getty Museum\\'s position. (Getty Oil was bought by Texaco, a deal that could be undone by a so-far successful lawsuit by Pennzoil.)  But sometimes Wall Streeters know just how they come across.  The most offensive ones relish it. Others suggest that stereotypes, used craftily, can be turned to one\\'s advantage. Confronting a potentially hostile Midwestern crowd, Daniel Scotto, a utility-bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, may opt for the Wall Street equivalent of full-body armor.  Outside New York, he says, \"If I think I need an extra edge, you will find me in full garb -- my Brooks Brothers suit, my suspenders and my yellow tie. Other places, with friends, say, I\\'ll switch to a softer approach. The light gray suit, blue shirt and blue tie.\"  Main Streeters can be just as canny. A common tactic might be called \"the country boy ploy,\" a ruse some executives west of the Hudson use in an attempt to coax an opponent into underestimating them.  Before Pennzoil\\'s court fight with Texaco over the Getty purchase, Mr. Liedtke -- one of the ploy\\'s foremost practitioners -- portrayed himself as something of an oil-patch rube, a notable feat considering his diplomas from Amherst College and Harvard Business School. What effect the approach had on Texaco isn\\'t known, but it certainly helped generate sympathetic media coverage for Pennzoil.  In any case, the $14 billion jury verdict in Mr. Liedtke\\'s favor makes some Wall Streeters wary of self-proclaimed country boys. \"Every time someone says, \\'I\\'m just a country boy,\\' I check my money, button my pockets and give my wallet to my secretary,\" says Rothschild\\'s Mr. Pirie.  There are tests to help discern Wall Streeters from Main Streeters. \"I look for the gold Rolex,\" says Chrysler\\'s Mr. Zuckerman. \"Wall Street is populated with gold Rolexes and summer houses in the Hamptons. They never talk long before they start on about their summer house in the Hamptons.\"  --- Mr. Burrough is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal\\'s Pittsburgh bureau.  ---  A Matter of Perspective Are chief executives of major corporations more or less ethical in their business practices today than they were 10 years ago?

       " 'WSJ870320-0190': '--- By James D. Gwartney</HL> The Economic Report of the President, released in January, contains an informative chapter on women in the labor force. It shows dramatic changes in the career choices of young women and the resulting changes in their earnings. The data suggest that women\\'s nontraditional choices are accomplishing what the anti-discrimination laws of the 1960s and 1970s did not: shrinking the large earnings gap between men and women.  After stagnating for decades, the earnings ratio of women to men has been moving upward in the 1980s. The latest figures from the Census Bureau show that in 1985 women earned 65% of what men did. This compares with the 1960-80 period, when the ratio for full-time workers changed little, ranging from a low of 57% in 1972 to a high of 60%, which was reached several times during the two decades. This stagnation suggests that 1960s legislation prohibiting employment discrimination and in some cases mandating affirmative action did little to improve the relative earnings of women.  There are, however, sound economic reasons to question whether employment discrimination is the sole reason or even the primary one behind the male-female pay gap.  The very size of the earnings differential should give one pause. If an employer really could hire women willing and able to do the same work as men for 40% less, he would have a very strong incentive to do so. The average business earns a profit of 5% on total sales. Surely many employers would jump at the chance to cut labor costs by 40%. As more and more employers did this, the demand for women would expand. Women\\'s earnings would rise and the earnings ratio would move toward parity.  A more convincing explanation for the differential lies in a married couple\\'s traditional attitudes toward work -- attitudes that have persisted over a very long time, but show recent signs of change. Married men typically pursue paid employment aggressively when they are the family\\'s primary breadwinner. To improve their earnings, married men are more likely than married women to accept transfers, pursue careers in which uninterrupted work experience is important, and accept jobs with long hours, uncertain schedules and out-of-town travel.  In contrast, women generally have had the primary responsibility for running households and caring for children. At least in the past, women have anticipated that they will interrupt their careers for various personal reasons. As a result, they tend to seek jobs with less travel and more flexible hours. They may also want jobs that will be available in a wide variety of locations so that if the family moves, they can enter the job market easily, with little reduction in earning power. Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that women have been attracted to nursing, teaching, secretarial and other jobs with easily transportable skills.  What evidence would support or contradict this hypothesis? Preferences cannot be easily measured, but we can compare the earnings of women relative to men according to marital status. The median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers who are female and married are only 60% that of married men. (If part-time, married workers are included, the ratio is 39%.) When single women are compared with single men, however, the ratio rises to 90% -- a much smaller difference in earnings.  Similarly, single men working full-time earn only 62% as much as married men. The logical conclusion is that a man with a wife to bear the greater share of their family responsibilities has more time to devote to his job, and the flexibility to adopt uncertain schedules or change locations, increasing his earning power.  Evidence is emerging that more and more women now plan for a long-term continuous attachment to the labor force, rather than merely intermittent periods of employment. The president\\'s economic report this year says that among a national sample of young white women in 1979, 72% expected to be working at age 35, up from only 28% in 1968.  There also has been a dramatic change in the educational choices of women. Today, more women are preparing for high-skilled, high-paying professions. As recently as 1971, only 7% of the law degrees and 10% of the accounting degrees were earned by women. In 1985, however, women earned 38% of the law degrees and 49% of the accounting degrees. Similar changes have taken place in other professions, including medicine, architecture and engineering. Of course, these changes will exert their primary impact in the future, as women now entering the professions and planning for a more permanent attachment to the labor force acquire experience and move up job ladders.  However, as the recent evidence indicates, these trends are already making a difference. Paradoxically, at a time when many feminist leaders consider the political environment hostile, women\\'s choices of occupation and work force attachment are propelling the relative earnings of women upward at last.  --- Mr. Gwartney is a professor of economics at Florida State University.

       " 'WSJ870320-0189': '--- How to Make Business History -- A Look at Tomorrow\\'s CEO Hall of Fame: The Stars, the Forgettables, the Footnotes --- By Amanda Bennett</HL> Twist the television dial or pick up one of the blizzard of glossy business magazines and there\\'s a corporate chieftain staring back. Sometimes it seems top executives get as much air time and ink these days as rock stars.  But will that fame endure? Which leaders of corporate America will live in memory like the Beatles or Elvis? Which will vanish like Moby Grape or Marianne Faithfull?  Business history is studded with figures of enduring fame. Henry Ford turned the automobile into an empire. John D. Rockefeller created the first oil trusts. Alfred Sloan shaped the idea of a modern corporation. Andrew Carnegie made his fortune in steel and devoted his life to philanthropy. Villains aren\\'t in short supply, either -- railway magnate Jay Gould caused the \"Black Friday\" panic with his speculation in gold.  But trying to identify the Henry Fords, Alfred Sloans or Jay Goulds of the 1980s isn\\'t easy. In search of answers, we made an unscientific and impressionistic survey, asking management professors, business historians, financial journalists and management consultants which chief executives will be remembered.  What chief executives do they think MBAs of the class of 2037 will study? Who will future managers admire and emulate? Or excoriate? What emerges is a list of men who, in the eyes of these observers, have had an impact beyond their own corporations and industries.  The list is short. While these observers find many chief executives praiseworthy, they predict few will be remembered.  Here then are the contemporary executives business observers believe will still be talked about after the 21st century rolls around.  -- The Leaders Walter Wriston is the only consistent nominee. \"He belongs on anybody\\'s list,\" says Thomas Horton, president of the American Management Association, a nonprofit group.  A champion of deregulation, Mr. Wriston will be remembered for his role in moving the staid banking industry into more complex financial services, those surveyed predict. At Citicorp, where Mr. Wriston was chairman through August 1984, he moved the bank holding company from concentrating on corporate lending into consumer banking.  The choice of Mr. Wriston reflects observers\\' feelings that to be remembered, one has to change more than just a company. \"He did more to change the banking system than anyone else,\" says Mr. Horton.  Mr. Wriston also is first choice because of his role as business statesman. \"He\\'s extraordinarily literate, persuasive and forceful,\" says John Jeuck, professor of business history at the University of Chicago\\'s business school. \"Clearly he\\'s one of the handful of industrial statesmen of this generation.\"  Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is often mentioned too, but for mixed reasons. Some think he will be remembered for his role in getting government loan guarantees to help bail out Chrysler. \"He not only turned around a company headed out of existence, but tended to take a stronger position on the appropriate role for government in helping out industry,\" says David Lewin, professor at Columbia University\\'s business school.  Others think Mr. Iacocca will be remembered for his personality and his role in popularizing business. \"He turned the faceless CEO into a cult figure,\" says management consultant Thomas J. Peters, co-author of the book \"In Search of Excellence.\"  But Mr. Iacocca may be remembered less than the social and political forces that surrounded him, many say. \"The real book on Iacocca isn\\'t written yet,\" says Paul Tiffany, a business historian at the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Wharton School. \"What saved Chrysler was a thing called quotas.\"  Edward Bowman, professor of management at Wharton, says, \"Iacocca could be in some professor\\'s textbook 50 years from now as an example of government-business involvement. Maybe as a footnote.\"  To many, this is the era of the entrepreneur. They believe that the people who will be remembered are those who, like Henry Ford, Montgomery Ward or Harvey Firestone, built companies from scratch. Frederick Smith at Federal Express Corp. is a popular choice. \"He represents the epitome of entrepreneurship,\" says Jim Farley, senior chairman of the consulting firm Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. \"History will remember Federal Express and that a guy had an idea and (made it work) against imposing odds. He created a new form of distribution.\"  The importance of a new industry will underscore the importance of the indvidual, says James Brian Quinn, a professor of management at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College. \"When you stand in the year 2000, and look back on three decades, the technology that will stand out . . . will be biotechnology.\"  \"Bob Swanson is the single most prominent name as a CEO in that business,\" Mr. Quinn says. Robert Swanson, Genentech Inc.\\'s founder and chief executive, turned Genentech into a major drug maker, with such products as genetically engineered insulin and the experimental drug Interferon.  Computers changed the world, too, but many feel that even the best known computer entrepreneurs, such as Steven P. Jobs, former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., will be forgotten. \"Jobs won\\'t be remembered,\" says Edward Bowman of Wharton. \"He\\'s a flash in the pan.\"  Others think Mr. Jobs will be remembered as a symbol of a new executive type. \"Steve Jobs won\\'t be forgotten,\" says Harold J. Leavitt, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and author of \"Corporate Pathfinders.\" \"He\\'s the children\\'s crusader, a young man with contemporary values and young attitudes. He\\'s a kind of a cult leader.\"  Some say the real guiding lights aren\\'t known yet. \"We are waiting for the second Sloan, but he won\\'t appear in an industrial company,\" maintains J.P. Donlon, editor of Chief Executive magazine. \"He will appear in a service industry.\"  -- The Dismantlers Many contend that the 1980s will be known for mergers and acquisitions, and corporate raiders such as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens will be remembered. \"These people are the ones who will be recalled 40 or 50 years from now as the robber barons of old,\" says Mr. Tiffany, the business historian.  Mr. Jeuck of the University of Chicago compares the rash of mergers and acquisitions of the 1980s with the turmoil of late 19th century American business -- in reverse.  \"At the end of the 19th century there was a whole epidemic of trust-building and pyramiding of trusts and holding companies, and the whole Rockefeller-Jay Gould era of consolidation of American industry,\" he says. \"This is in a different direction. It\\'s a disintegration process.\"  -- Rogues In business as elsewhere, there\\'s more than one way to acquire a lasting reputation. \"I picked DeLorean because he was an entrepreneur with a lot of flair,\" says Stanford\\'s Mr. Leavitt. He notes that John Z. DeLorean\\'s bid for enduring fame got some unwanted boosts: \"Being arrested will help. Anything that gets (people) into the media will help.\" Mr. DeLorean, whose automobile company went into receivership in 1982, was acquitted of cocaine smuggling charges and later acquitted of charges that he diverted company funds for his own use.  Many agree that a brush with the law can win a place in history. So for Wharton\\'s Mr. Bowman, a candidate for lasting fame is Ivan Boesky. He believes Mr. Boesky\\'s agreement to pay $100 million in settlement of insider trading charges will survive in memory after the less-sullied reputations of others have faded.  Theodore Levitt, editor of the Harvard Business Review, says, \"The things that are remembered are things of rascality and notoriety because they become metaphors and symbols,\" and he predicts that our age one day will be called \"the Boesky era.\"  -- Outsiders Our survey specified chief executives of American corporations. But some experts said they wouldn\\'t play unless we changed the rules. To them, the business leaders Americans are most likely to remember are Japanese.  \"What do you do when they are producing in the U.S.?\" asks David Lewin, professor of business at Columbia\\'s business school. He nominates Akio Morita, chairman and chief executive at Sony Corp., which has five manufacturing plants in the U.S. In a new, multinational environment, says Mr. Lewin, top business leaders are top business leaders wherever you find them. \"These are pace-setting companies. We are learning lessons from those abroad.\"  Mr. Quinn at Amos Tuck says, \"The guy who deserves world mention and will clearly be recognized by his country and by the world is Konosuke Matsushita, who founded Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.\" He adds: \"When you hear Japanese mangement style referred to, very often the model is Matsushita.\"  -- Nobody \"I\\'ll be damned if I can come up with anybody,\" says John Gallagher, senior lecturer in business policy at the University of Chicago\\'s business school.  It\\'s not that he didn\\'t try: Mr. Gallagher questioned two classes of students, totaling 110 people, and circulated the question informally at \"three or four\" meetings of boards he sits on. \"Everyone says \\'Duh . . .\\'\" he reports.  The key, he says, is the anonymity of corporate work. The people who are remembered are founders, the people who have their names on the door. Today corporations are bureaucratic, he says. Even entrepreneurs are surrounded by a crowd of venture capitalists, investment bankers and regulators.  \"Since Thomas Watson Jr., IBM has been run by a sea of faceless people,\" he says. \"I couldn\\'t give you the name of the current president of Xerox or IBM if my life depended on it. (Steven) Jobs . . . (is) hardly known now, much less 50 years from now. Will Roger Smith be famous 50 years from now? Hell, no.\"  Management expert Peter Drucker agrees: \"Chief executives . . . are rarely remembered and rarely worth remembering. They are servants.\"  --- Ms. Bennett reports on management from The Wall Street Journal\\'s New York bureau.  ---  Heroes of the CEOs The Wall Street Journal survey on executive style asked CEOs to name their business heroes.

       " 'WSJ870320-0188': 'Amid Debate Over Benefit to Cities --- By Hal Lancaster Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> In the beginning was the playing field, and it was good.  Then came television and agents and, most of all, big money. And somewhere between Chicago\\'s ancient Comiskey Park and the ultramodern Superdome in New Orleans, the playing field evolved into the enclosed, multi-use stadium, a symbol of civic vitality linked not only to baseball and football but to politics and economic development as well. Along the way, acquiring a stadium became one of the most fiercely fought games in sports.  At present, some 20 North American cities are each gambling $100 million or more that a new or renovated stadium will lure or keep a coveted sports franchise. A wide range of people are involved, including team owners, architects and a flotilla of legal, financial and political specialists, who scrap for consulting jobs that barely existed a decade ago.  But amid the action, questions abound. Will there be enough teams, tractor pulls and trade shows to keep all the stadiums from racking up huge deficits? How will the new tax law affect financing and the boom in luxury seating, which is helping to fuel many of the ventures? And most fundamentally, who ultimately will pay for the stadiums -- and who will benefit?  Supporters of the ventures frequently argue that, even if a stadium loses money, the community benefits from the development it attracts and the jobs it creates. Moreover, they contend, each dollar spent at the stadium ripples through the economy -- the so-called multiplier effect -- as it is spent and re-spent.  Critics counter that the true beneficiaries are team owners, who usually wind up with favorable deals either to relocate or stay put, while losses generally wind up in the taxpayer\\'s lap. Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in suburban Chicago who has studied stadium economics, asserts that jobs created by stadiums are largely temporary (construction) or low-paying (service), and that the multiplier effect can be illusory. Typically, he notes, money spent at sports events isn\\'t new, but is shifted from another activity, such as family entertainment. In seven of nine cities he studied, the city\\'s share of regional income actually declined after a new stadium was built.  The New Orleans Superdome, which opened in 1975, illustrates both sides of the debate. On the one hand, the lavish facility ended up costing $163 million instead of the original estimate of $45 million, and it has run up some impressive deficits -- as much as about $12 million annually from 1977 to 1980. But it has also sparked an estimated $5.5 billion building boom and made New Orleans a regular stop on the Super Bowl rotation -- which means an estimated $100 million economic infusion every four or five years. \"It was the deal of the century,\" says Glennon Walsh, a stadium designer with St. Louis-based Sverdrup &amp; Parcel and Associates Inc., which took part in the Superdome\\'s construction.  Perhaps, but Prof. Baade believes much of the development would have happened anyway. Also, not all stadiums have inspired such development, and some cities -- particularly colder, northern ones -- wouldn\\'t get a Super Bowl no matter what kind of facility they built. \"You may bring in business, but offsetting that is the operating deficit,\" says Bruce Bingham, a consultant with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. in New York. \"If budgets are strained and you have to raise taxes, you\\'re shooting yourself in the foot.\"  Indeed, threadbare public budgets have forced developers to finance creatively, and have given rise to the latest buzzword in stadiums: \"privatization.\" Though most stadiums still rely heavily on public money, private sources of revenue are playing a greater role.  Consider Toronto\\'s plan: $30 million from municipal taxes, $30 million from provincial lottery proceeds and $5 million each from 15 corporations buying the rights to such things as supply contracts, advertising, parking spaces and use of the stadium logo. Individuals can contribute by purchasing up to $15 million of sponsorship tiles on the stadium\\'s \"Wall of Fame,\" or some $15 million of preferred shares that may be issued publicly. Revenue could also come from a proposed 450-room hotel attached to and owned by the stadium, and, of course, from luxury boxes.  Luxury boxes, which have gained immense popularity among stadium developers, are a major element in most privatization plans. These enclosed seating arrangements, usually featuring such amenities as couches and television sets, lease for up to $50,000 a year. Often used to entertain business clients, they can help pay off debt service, provide added revenue for team owners and sharply reduce or eliminate government subsidies, making stadium projects more palatable politically.  But privatization based on luxury boxes depends largely on the market. \"You have to have a team that people will kill to see,\" as well as enough businesses with a need to entertain important customers, says Larry Greenberg, a stadium consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Minneapolis. And under the new tax law, he adds, future stadium projects won\\'t be able to use tax-exempt bonds for financing; thus, cash-flow requirements in private developments will rise. New deductability rules may also slow demand for luxury boxes.  Mr. Bingham of Peat Marwick fears, too, that an overabundance of stadiums will strain the supply of special events needed to cover expenses. \"Dark days,\" he says, referring to the times when a facility isn\\'t booked, \"are death.\"  Naturally, sports-hungry cities believe promoters will fill the need for events, that teams can be lured and that local businesses will always buy luxury boxes, regardless of team quality or tax deductability. Why else would St. Petersburg, Fla., and San Antonio, Tex., among others, be pursuing stadiums so ardently?  Last November, St. Petersburg broke ground on an $85 million domed baseball stadium despite a sobering letter from Peter Ueberroth, the sport\\'s commissioner. \"We interpreted that letter as saying that if you\\'re thinking that by building a stadium you\\'ll get a team faster, please be aware that won\\'t be the case and you might never get it,\" says Robert D. Obering, the city manager. The city, still confident it can win a major-league team, hopes that until it does it will be able to book 100 days of conventions annually, as predicted by its marketing consultants.  Critics claim, however, that St. Petersburg lacks enough hotel rooms to support the conventions (though Mr. Obering believes the stadium will encourage construction of more.) And the city also faces competition from another stadium project across the bay in Tampa.  In San Antonio, Jim Eskin, executive director of San Antonians for a Domed Stadium, sees new jobs and a booming tourist trade through his \"macroeconomic binoculars.\" But San Antonio, a small market that hasn\\'t supported sports teams well in the past, hasn\\'t yet surveyed interest in luxury boxes, a significant part of the financing plan. Nor has the city been prominently mentioned as an expansion candidate by either professional baseball or professional football.  Mr. Eskin insists that his city has been overlooked because it doesn\\'t have an adequate stadium. \"This is a make-or-break year,\" he says. \"There\\'s a footrace to get teams, and if we don\\'t get cracking we\\'ll fall further behind.\"  For both cities, this is risky. \"You have to have at least one franchise, or a virtual monopoly on events in your area,\" for a stadium venture to work, says Marc Ganis, a partner in Sportssuites Inc., a New York-based builder of stadium additions.  Whether the issues surrounding stadiums are resolved or not, development fever could cool soon if interest rates rise sharply or if sports leagues find a way to restrict franchise relocations without running afoul of antitrust laws. Moreover, the special arrangement under which the cities currently considering stadium projects can continue using tax-exempt bonds expires in 1990. \"The party\\'s certainly going to slow down\" by then, says Mr. Greenberg, the stadium consultant. \"I\\'ll probably have to find something else to do.\" ',\n",

This reverse metamorphosis from flash-and-trash butterfly to well-turned-out worm is a delicate maneuver that requires perfect timing and a devotion to greed strong enough to overcome the mental torture associated with going bland. (If you own your company and don\\'t have to grovel to bankers and investors, forget this part.)  We aren\\'t talking about executive style here. (Incidentally, men\\'s fashion designer John Weitz, who wrote \"Man in Charge\" and lunches with tycoons a lot, says that in today\\'s takeover-ravaged corporate America, CEOs rarely last long enough to develop their own style. Ousted CEOs, on the other hand, have a definite style. \"It\\'s extraordinary how they shrivel and slouch,\" Mr. Weitz says. But that\\'s another story.)  What we are talking about here is packaging -- that expensive game of visual trickery long associated with the Cheshire cat and annual reports. Both sexes can play, though experts say the aspiring female CEO will have to spend at least 50% more on packaging than her male counterpart to achieve prudent levels of blandness.  All this is especially perilous at the moment because you\\'re climbing the ladder in the middle of a slight uptick in flamboyance -- bright hankies (pocket squares), suspenders (braces) with frolicking nudes, tie bars, that kind of stuff. As always, ascent rates depend on looks, not deeds (though for men, marrying the boss\\'s daughter remains a strong move).  So forget about hard work, innovative thinking, the bottom line and the rest of the stuff in this report. This is the straight poop. We\\'ve consulted the oracles of corporate fashion, read the how-to books, scoured the magazines and ads (\"Introducing DeRigueur, for the man who has learned to wear his income properly.\")  We\\'ve even attended a \"dynamic Executive Wardrobe Engineering seminar,\" conducted for $2,500 by Lois (\"Dress for Excellence\") Fenton. This is the same seminar Ms. Fenton gives for the troops at Drexel Burnham Lambert, so she is obviously the real power behind junk bonds. (For $900 a day, she\\'ll go shopping with you, too.)  Dash out and buy yourself the proper writing implement: a Mont Blanc Diplomat fountain pen (List: $265) is fine; the same model in solid gold ($6,500) is a bit much. And take good notes.  Basics first. Columnist Dave Barry, author of the seminal work \"Claw Your Way to the Top,\" says it best: \"Basically, the American businessman should dress as though he recently lost his entire family in a tragic boat explosion.\"  This is neither cheap nor easy. Furthermore, CEO candidates aren\\'t just business executives. They\\'re would-be titans. They can\\'t be just average. They have to mold the basic dull look into their own fashion statement and pay exorbitant sums to achieve it.  You can\\'t get away anymore with a dark blue suit, white shirt and dark blue tie. It says you\\'re playing it safe. It makes board members suspicious. You can\\'t get away with being what the trade calls \"fashion forward,\" either. (That means wearing togs designed by guys whose names end in vowels.) It says you\\'re playing it unsafe. It makes board members suspicious.  Men have a primordial fear of dandyism. Potential CEOs have to pretend they don\\'t care about clothes. They must keep their preoccupations with mirrors in the closet. And if you don\\'t think they know about mirrors, how do you explain the stock market?  The basic problem (beyond the fact that American men usually wear pants that are too short, scruffy shoes, short-sleeved shirts and things colored purple or green) is dumb suits. Unless you\\'re paying a grand or so for your dark blue or grey caulk stripe, you may as well punt.  The safest suit in America (price range: $875 to $1,295) is made in Chicago by Oxxford Clothes Inc., whose chairman, Jack McDonald, humbly explains: \"We aim it at the power structure of the United States. We aim to separate the men from the boys.\"  Says designer-author Alan Flusser (whose own tailor-made suits sell for $895): \"Wearing an Oxxford is like wearing molded air, it\\'s so soft. It actually feels like what it costs. It\\'s better than 99% of the custom-tailored suits in the world. But in my opinion, it\\'s designed for a guy who wants to feel great in a suit yet has no sense of aesthetics whatsoever.\"  Custom-made suits: Besides Mr. Flusser, there\\'s Morty Sills, also in New York, and Savile Row. You can do all right in Hong Kong (cheap buttons are a dead giveaway) if you\\'re smart. It\\'s kind of like shopping at Brooks Brothers -- okay, but you want to try to avoid being seen doing it.  Dark blue, gray, striped or solid, and tan. Not dark brown. If you think Ronald Reagan is in trouble with Americans because of his Iran-Contra fiasco or deficits, think again. Our sartorial sleuths say it\\'s because he wears dark brown suits.  Shirts: Paying through the nose is the best policy. Custom-mades by Turnbull &amp; Asser (London) can skirt dandyism. Paul Stuart (New York, Tokyo) sells made-to-measure shirts for from $58 to a seemingly hefty $130 each because, among other things, their \"cuffs have a personal relationship to the wrists they encircle.\" Any shirts that have personal relationships seem highly desirable to us.  \"You will never, ever, as long as you live, wear a short-sleeved shirt for any business purpose,\" wrote John T. (\"Dress for Success\") Molloy. This is nonsense if you live in San Diego, says Mr. Weitz.  Watches: The way science education is going in this country, it may soon be a sign of intellectual prowess to be able to tell time on an analog. So you want a watch with hands, not digital displays. That chunky Rolex diving watch that James Bond and JFK popularized in the \\'60s, Mr. Weitz notes, was made to say: \"Stay down here at 140 feet for another four minutes, and a meteor storm of nitrogen bubbles will soon make cottage cheese out of your brain.\" If you want to say that around the office, wear one. If your brain is already cottage cheese, wear the solid gold version.  Footwear: People who wear scuffed shoes are communists. Period. People who wear dumb shoes are Japanese businessmen. If you want to know why having all the money doesn\\'t bring Japan respect, look at Japanese feet.  Best off-the-shelf shoes in America are at, of all places, Brooks Brothers. They\\'re British-made. So, of course, are good Church\\'s. Our man, surely, needs custom-made. And that means John Lobb, the legendary British bootmaker. But when somebody asks, \"Aren\\'t those Lobb of St. James?\" you say, \"Oh, heavens no. Lobb of Paris, of course.\" Older, more experienced shoemakers there, Mr. Flusser points out.  In any case, dip into your children\\'s education fund. Lobbs cost around $500 each. No, not each pair. Each foot. Note: White shoes are fine, if you\\'re aspiring to be CEO of a company selling pre-owned Oldsmobiles in Podunk.  Ties: There is nothing wrong with spending $50 for a necktie. When some ties start costing $100, however, you\\'ll have to throw all your $50 ties away or risk looking cheap.  Please, no ties that tell a story, like the one we own that shows Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing. Says Ms. Fenton: Ties need names, like foulards. Our paced-incremental-dullness formula dictates that whatever gewgaw patterns you have on your foulards (diamonds, crowns, pheasants, dots, baby sharks, whatever), do this: With each major promotion, buy new ones on which the gewgaws are one size smaller. Men who wear dark blue ties with microscopic pin dots are called \"Sir\" a lot.  And only buy silk. (For that matter, never wear any clothes made out of petroleum, only things made by sheep, plants or worms).  Colors: For people who actually produce a tangible product, dark blue, burgundy and power red are in. Wall Street money shufflers can still get away with yellow (very 1985). Pink is still around, but avoid it if your company makes a product with more than three moving parts.  Bow ties are making a bit of a comeback. But would you trust Arthur Schlesinger or George Will to be your CEO?  Leisure: You need to start practicing now so you won\\'t show up at the fox hunt in bluejeans.  Tennis, running and sweat sports are exercise, not leisure. Golf should be considered work and thus conducted during working hours. True leisure starts with a Thomas &amp; Thomas catalog. You need a fine Tonkin bamboo or old Leonard flyrod, a reel by Ross, Hardy or Michel Pezon and custom-made Ranger waders (trout can be trite unless you go to Bhutan or New Zealand for them, but Labrador and Norway salmon never are).  To demonstrate they aren\\'t averse to bloodletting at the helm, CEOs must appreciate sedate blood sports (not dog-fighting, dummy). Thus the need for shotguns. Purdeys, of course, or Holland &amp; Holland. A brace. While you may think that sacrificing your child\\'s education is a high price to pay for $40,000 worth of shotguns, just remember: There is nothing more telling than a man with a single Purdey.  If death disturbs you, shoot clay pigeons. Just keep it to yourself.  Dogs: Two or three Chinese sharpeis for the wife are okay. But your dogs should do what dogs were made to do: hunt, point and retrieve, not roll over or chase some dumb ball. A stubborn Chesapeake Bay retriever or American water spaniel will do. Borzois, mastiffs -- we don\\'t know. If you need a dog for protection, you live in the wrong neighborhood to be a CEO. For children: any old expensive mutt.  And a yacht. But, pul-eeze, refer to it as a boat.  --- Mr. Sterba is a senior special writer in The Wall Street Journal\\'s New York bureau. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0185': 'By Consumers Increased 1.7% --- Personal Income Rose 0.9%; Auto Sales Climb Fueled Rebound in Spending --- By Rose Gutfeld Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN> Consumer spending jumped 1.7% in February after a sharp drop the month before, while personal income rose a healthy 0.9%, the Commerce Department said.  The increase in spending followed a 2% plunge in January, the sharpest since the department began keeping the figures in 1959, and a revised 2.4% surge in December. The December rise was previously reported as 2.2%.  The income increase followed a 0.2% rise in January. The figures were affected by several factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and a pay raise for federal workers. Excluding such factors, income increased 0.6% in February and 0.3% in January.  Much of the February rebound in spending reflected higher auto sales, partly in response to dealer incentives. Also, car sales had fallen sharply in January after surging in December as consumers sought to beat the Jan. 1 repeal of the sales-tax deduction.  Despite the February spurt, many economists contend spending will decline or will change very little for the quarter. Consumer outlays fell in the fourth quarter.  \"This was a rebound from extremely depressed levels,\" said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, who predicts that spending will show a drop for the quarter. Although he expects outlays to gain moderately in the second quarter, he contends that growth will be constrained by low consumer savings levels.  Last month, the savings rate fell to 3.6% of after-tax income from 4% in January.  Spending on durable goods, which are intended to last three years or more, rose last month after falling in January. Spending on nondurable goods and on services increased in both months.  On income, the department said the farm subsidy payments affected both the January and February figures, while the pay raise for federal workers occurred in January. Also affecting the January data were cost-of-living adjustments and changes in the contribution levels for Social Security and other programs. The changes included increases in the taxable wage base for Social Security and in the monthly premium for supplemental medical insurance.  Even accounting for these factors, several economists characterized the latest rise in income as robust, saying it reflected the strong employment figures of recent months. \"It\\'s the outsize increases in employment we\\'ve been having,\" said Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago.  But he added that some of that strength may be attributable to unseasonably warm weather that buoyed construction employment. Income gains may be smaller in the months ahead, he said.  Wages and salaries rose 0.8% in February after a 0.6% rise the month before. Factory payrolls increased 0.5% after a 0.4% advance.  For the second month in a row, unusual factors distorted disposable income, the amount of money people had available to spend. In February, there was an increase in withheld federal income taxes partly reflecting the adjustment by individuals of their tax withholding to reflect the new tax law. In January, withholding had been reduced, partly because many people hadn\\'t made the adjustment and were having too little taken out of their paychecks.  There was a drop in estimated tax payments in February, however, following an increase in January, when people were trying to compensate for insufficient withholding. State and local tax payments fell in February.  In listing these items, the department cautioned that estimates of tax payments at this time of year are based on fragmentary information and are subject to larger revision than usual.  The income and spending figures are adjusted for seasonal variation, but not for inflation. A spending-based price measure reported after a one-month lag rose 0.8% in January after increasing 0.3% in December.  The February rise in outlays brought them to a $2.856 trillion annual rate from a $2.807 trillion pace in January. Income increased to a $3.581 trillion rate from a $3.549 trillion pace.  Here is the Commerce Department\\'s latest report on personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.   Feb.

In 1985, the loss was $326,000, which included profit from discontinued operations of $625,000. Revenue soared to $8.1 million from $119,000 last year. Blockbuster, which operates and licenses video rental stores, said that $954,000 of its 1986 deficit was attributable to its Amtech investment.  Amtech is developing an electronic identification security system, which Blockbuster says isn't compatible with its video rental business. Blockbuster said Amtech also would require substantial additional funding to develop and market its product and is expected to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future.  Messrs.

       " 'WSJ870320-0182': '--- By Lawrence W. Sherman</HL> A coup d\\'etat has taken over American policing. Gradually, with little public notice, police managers have lost control over how officers spend their time. The usurper is the telephone.  According to at least one police chief, 911 runs the police department. Most police effort is directed simply on the basis of telephoned citizen requests for immediate service. This system is neither rational nor democratic.  Sgt. Bud Emerson of the Minneapolis Police Department has an experimental weapon to cut down on chronic calls to 911, something no other police department has. This weapon, a computer printout, lists the handful of addresses that generate the most crime in Minneapolis. The list includes the 500 addresses (out of 172,000 in the city) that produced 23% of all the robberies, 15% of all the rapes and 19% of all the assaults and disturbances in 1986. The list, produced by the Crime Control Institute in Washington, D.C., also shows that a mere 5% of all the addresses in Minneapolis produced 64% of all the calls for police service.  Sgt. Emerson and the four officers in the Minneapolis Police RECAP (Repeat Call Address Policing) Unit have another weapon in very short supply: time. Because other officers are responsible for answering the 911 calls the RECAP Unit is analyzing, RECAP officers have time to study the list and examine the types and times of calls at each address. They have time to talk to the owners, managers and residents of the most active addresses, to diagnose the problems and to seek solutions. And they have time to follow up on the problems to make sure the solutions are working, or to try other approaches that will work better.  Police have known for years that crime is more concentrated in some parts of a city than in others. But it was not until the National Institute of Justice sponsored the RECAP project that it became clear just how concentrated crime is. For even in a high-crime area, most addresses never suffer the crimes that generate calls for police service. Patrolling just as much at those addresses as at the high-crime addresses may well be a waste of time and money.  Police also have known that they get many repeat calls at certain addresses. With the growth of 911 systems, such calls have increased, and police spend more time at these most active addresses than at other locations. But it is not \"quality\" time. Their responses must be brief and superficial, given the time pressures they are under to respond to still other repeat-call locations. Such \"reactive\" policing, as Yale University\\'s Albert Reiss calls it, keeps putting out the fire but never takes away the matches.  Minneapolis Police Chief Anthony Bouza, chairman of the Crime Control Institute, agreed to help test the Institute\\'s RECAP plan as part of his commitment to the new philosophy of \"proactive\" policing, under which police take greater initiative in analyzing and selecting the crime problems they will attack. Repeat offenders, narcotics pushers, drunken drivers and corrupt congressmen (in Abscam) have all been the focus of such proactive efforts in recent years.  While critics of proactive policing find \"Big Brother\" overtones in such efforts, they probably would find much of the RECAP Unit\\'s work innocuous.  One address on Sgt. Emerson\\'s list, for example, showed almost daily burglar alarms at 5:30 a.m., consistently false. With different officers handling the calls, no one ever noticed the pattern. But once RECAP officer Skip Goodmanson looked into it, he found that a newspaper delivery crew was throwing a stack of newspapers off the truck and up against the front door, setting off the alarm. A conversation with the delivery crew solved the problem.  Another address on the list was a skid-row mission, which generated repeated calls because of drunks they had expelled smashing the windows and breaking in the door. RECAP advised the mission to get shatterproof plexiglass windows and a steel door.  But RECAP is also attacking serious crime. After meeting regularly with the owner of a chronic-call apartment building, RECAP officer David Martens learned that there was a large drug-selling operation in one of the apartments. His information helped the Narcotics Unit get a warrant to make the largest heroin seizure in that city in recent years.  The landlord of another building examined the RECAP printout to see which tenants generated most of the calls for domestic disturbances, noise complaints and other problems. On the basis of the printout, he said he would try to evict the tenants generating chronic problems.  This raises the question of whether the police in a free society should be in the business of getting people evicted, or even providing information to landlords that may have that effect. In Minneapolis, a call to the police is a public record and there is no legal basis to deny anyone access to such information. If evictions can help deter future problems, then police should not discourage landlords from taking such actions.  Most of the businesses on Minneapolis\\'s RECAP list have been surprised to discover just how many police dispatches are directed to their locations. But with a few exceptions, they have been very cooperative in trying to find ways to reduce repeat calls. Number one on the list, a large discount retail store, had 810 calls last year, the bulk of them for police to do paper work on shoplifters who had already been apprehended. In consultation with Sgt. Emerson, the store decided to hire off-duty police officers to book the shoplifters at the store\\'s expense.  Perhaps the least cooperative group has been bar owners, one of whom would not even return phone calls from RECAP. Some of the bars on the list have substantial problems of violent crime. RECAP has ideas for how the bars can reduce such crime (such as not admitting or not serving intoxicated customers). But if a bar doesn\\'t cooperate, the RECAP officers can use their printout to argue that the bar\\'s liquor license should be revoked.  This \"problem-solving\" RECAP strategy is only one way of dealing with the concentration of crime at a few addresses. In addition, traditional police methods, such as foot patrols, decoys and the presence of police cars, might be much more effective if they were concentrated at the high-crime addresses. Municipal budget cutbacks require police to do what the National Institute of Justice\\'s director calls working smarter, not harder, to fight crime.  --- Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute, which is developing and testing the RECAP strategy in Minneapolis.

       " 'WSJ870320-0177': 'Design Problems Remain --- By Hal Lancaster Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> David Alexander and his computer are making sure that baseball fans at the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, Fla., will get a good view of the action.  An architect with Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum Inc., the project\\'s designer, Mr. Alexander can call up an overhead plan of the stadium and then zero in on a specific section and seat. The computer does the rest, displaying in seconds what used to take hours to calculate -- the location\\'s view of the field.  Such advances as computer simulation are helping architects to anticipate and correct many of the kinds of problems that have cropped up in the past: seats stuck behind thick columns at Baltimore\\'s Memorial Stadium; lights at Minneapolis\\'s Metrodome that make every fly ball an adventure; gales that do the same at San Francisco\\'s Candlestick Park, perhaps the world\\'s largest unintentional wind tunnel.  But ideal solutions to some basic problems remain elusive. And with so much money and community pride at stake, there is considerable pressure on designers to find ways to get it right. \"The multi-use stadium is the civic icon of the late 20th century,\" says Philip Bess, a Chicago architect. \"It\\'s the equivalent of a cathedral, proof in the citizens\\' minds that they\\'re world-class cities.\"  One problem architects are wrestling with is the awkward marriage between the rectangular gridiron and the baseball diamond. Plans for a Phoenix, Ariz., stadium address this with a design in which the end-zone stands and two wedged-shaped sections between the 10- and 20-yard lines can be pulled out, allowing the remaining stands to swing together.  To be truly flexible, enclosed stadiums must be usable for basketball, hockey and concerts as well. But such versatility adds special requirements. Because stadiums have so many seats, for example, basketball fans typically don\\'t feel pressed to buy season tickets, an important source of team revenue. And basketball teams like a more intimate, rabid atmosphere than the stadiums allow, architects say. Thus, some new designs feature moveable stands and false walls and ceilings that reduce the 60,000 or more stadium seats to 20,000 or fewer. Architects are also simulating intimacy with sound-reflective panels.  Roofs have long been a headache. Early, hard domes necessitated round stadiums for support -- an inconvenient shape for both baseball and football. And critics snipe that they cost too much, leak and create a cavelike atmosphere. Seattle\\'s concrete Kingdome is \"depressing,\" says Ronald Turner, an architect with Howard Needles Tammen &amp; Bergendoff. \"If you have a choice of going sailing or going into the dark kingdom, you\\'ll go sailing.\"  Air-supported fabric roofs, often made of Teflon-coated fiberglass, seemed to be the answer. They cost an average $9 million (about half as much as hard domes) and let some sunlight in -- as much as 30% with newer fabrics. But heating costs are high, and fabric domes can collapse in winter if snow-melting machines fail. Air pressure is another problem: At the Hoosierdome in Indianapolis, for example, only a few doors can be opened at a time or the roof will deflate. And patrons are propelled out the exits by 45-mile-an-hour winds.  Enter the cable-supported fabric dome, which with insulation costs an average $13 million -- still about a third less than hard shells.  Designs for Phoenix, Cleveland, Toronto and San Antonio, Tex., include the latest wrinkle in domes: retractability, which satisfies baseball fans\\' craving for sunshine and football fans\\' need for warmth. Phoenix\\'s fabric dome will cost an estimated $13 million; Toronto, with an especially complex concrete design, will shell out $90 million, according to some projections. But not everyone raves about retractables. \"Some (proposed designs) won\\'t work, and some will cost considerably more than projected,\" says David Geiger, a New York-based dome designer.  Before he died last year, John Waterbury of Iffland Kavanaugh Waterbury P.C., designers of Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and Shea Stadium in New York, produced perhaps the most radical idea for a multi-use stadium. What if you laid the baseball field on top of the football field? he wondered. Then, when baseball season ended, the entire field could be lifted mechanically and hooked to the second deck, forming a domed football stadium. So far, nobody has embraced the plan. But, says Jerome Iffland, the firm\\'s president, \"someone will steal our idea eventually. It\\'s a concept that\\'s got to be used.\" ',\n",

The move by Toronto-based Abitibi-Price comes at a time of tightening newsprint supplies world-wide and just prior to the start of labor negotiations involving 30,000 unionized workers and more than 20 eastern Canadian paper producers, including Abitibi-Price.  \"It\\'s a disappointment and a surprise,\" Homer Taylor, president of Scripps-Howard Supply Co., a Cincinnati-based unit of Scripps-Howard Newspapers, said of the planned price increase.

With discounts taken into effect, its new price will rise to $552.90 (U.S.) a metric ton from $514.43.  MacMillan Bloedel sells primarily to consumers in the western U.S., where prices have been lower in recent years, while Abitibi-Price sells primarily in other regions.  Industry observers say the price increases come at a time of tightening newsprint supplies world-wide. Aggravating the situation was an earthquake earlier this month in New Zealand that has halted output at a large newsprint mill operated by Fletcher Challenge Ltd. The closure is expected to result in diversion of some Canadian newsprint to Australia and Southeast Asia.  The Canadian Paperworkers Union last week selected Abitibi-Price as the target company in contract talks with eastern Canadian paper producers. The union represents about 4,700 workers at 10 Abitibi-Price mills in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland.  The union is seeking a 7.1% wage increase in the first year and 8% in the second year of a two-year accord. The current average wage rate is $14.10 (Canadian) an hour. Formal talks are set to begin April 21. ',\n",

The sale also will likely further postpone the sale of state-owned concerns -- such as Britain\\'s water authorities -- that have been viewed as likely candidates for denationalization.  As previously reported, Margaret Thatcher\\'s Conservative government said Wednesday it plans to sell its BP stake, currently valued at the equivalent of more than $7.5 billion, in the year ending March 31, 1988. Although the Tories earlier had indicated they planned to eventually sell the BP shares, few industry analysts expected the sale so soon.  Receipts from the sale would help the government stay on schedule in its recently accelerated denationalization program, under which it plans to sell assets valued at $8 billion in each of the next three years. The government sold assets valued at $20 billion during its first eight years in office.  At the same time, the sale should be less controversial than the denationalization of an entire state-owned business. Last July, the government postponed plans to denationalize the country\\'s water industry after some managers resisted the move and workers threatened lawsuits.  \"With an election coming, BP is noncontroversial,\" said Andrew Bain, an economist at Midland Bank PLC. \"Nobody is going to be uspet\" with the government for selling its remaining shares in the company.  The Treasury said yesterday that selling its stake in BP, which owns 55% of Standard Oil Co. of the U.S., will probably push back the sale of other state assets. That\\'s because the $7.5 billion that the sale would generate almost meets the government\\'s goal of selling $8 billion of assets annually.  Britain\\'s water industry, electric utilities and British Steel Corp. have been among the candidates most often mentioned as denationalization targets.  The Treasury yesterday said the sale of the BP shares already had been taken into account in the budget, unveiled Tuesday, for the year starting April 1. That means the sale won\\'t lead to further tax cuts or reduce government borrowing.  The government said the BP sale would be \"subject to market conditions,\" but it didn\\'t specify how or when the shares would be sold. The sale presumably is contingent on the Conservative Party\\'s winning the next election. The election must be held before June 1988 but is expected sometime this year.  The sale is expected to have little effect on BP itself. The company said it welcomes the sale because it \"will clear up a number of uncertainties which have affected both the market\\'s attitude to BP and our own financial planning.\"  --- Rolls-Royce Posts Profit LONDON -- Rolls-Royce PLC, the state-owned aircraft engine maker, reported record profit for 1986, thereby polishing its image just weeks before the government sells it to the public.  The company said net income rose 56%, to the equivalent of $192.4 million from $123.5 million in 1985. Sales rose 13%, to $2.89 billion from $2.57 billion. Its civil-engine sector, where operating profit increased 88% to $219.7 million from $117.1 million, was the major contributor to the improved results, the company said.  The public offering, to occur in late April or early May, is expected to raise more than $1.6 billion. Rolls-Royce no longer has any relation to the car maker with the same name. (The car maker has been a Vickers PLC unit since 1971.)  To keep the strategically important company in British hands, the government will limit foreign-held shares to 15% of the total. It also will require government approval for disposals of more than 25% of the company\\'s assets or significant assets used for the nuclear business.  The government rescued Rolls-Royce from bankruptcy in 1971. Since then, the company has cut its work force almost in half, tightened up financial controls and improved productivity. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0169': 'Get Us to the Gate on Time</HL> TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN> Every frequent air traveler can recite horror stories about interminably delayed or abruptly canceled flights. The Federal Aviation Administration reports that a record number of flights were delayed last year at the nation\\'s 22 busiest airports. The reasons for this post-deregulation mess are complex, but there is little question that it adds up to major frustration for air travelers.  This week the FAA has been taking another run at the extreme flight congestion that builds up around \"peak\" hours, or the day\\'s most popular travel times. Meeting in Washington with more than 100 airlines, the agency is trying to arrange adjustments in summer flight schedules at seven of the more congested airports, such as Newark, Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare and Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield Airport.  The airlines participated in the FAA-initiated talks with great reluctance. The carriers complained that coordination of schedules among rivals is inherently anti-competitive (as the Department of Transportation acknowledged by virtue of Secretary Elizabeth Dole\\'s offer of antitrust immunity to the airlines), and only a step removed from re-regulation of the airline industry. Moreover, airline executives say, the FAA\\'s actions are only a temporary solution.  In fact, similar discussions among the airlines in 1984 yielded only short-term results. Schedule changes lasted six months and during that period delays were down. But when airlines adjusted their schedules to respond to increased consumer demand for certain flights, delays increased.  There are two quick-fixes for this problem. The airlines can stifle demand by raising fares, or the FAA can exercise its authority to restrict the number of flights particular airlines may offer at given times. The hot competition among airlines makes fare-raising unlikely, so that leaves an FAA-decreed solution. It is this possibility that worries the airlines.  Similar concerns were raised in a memorandum the FAA solicited from the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC said the FAA\\'s action \"is likely to harm both competition and consumers.\" It also warned that although the airlines were granted antitrust immunity solely to discuss scheduling, some might take advantage of the opportunity to collude on fares and service in individual markets. Another prospect, the FTC warned, is that the FAA\\'s action ultimately might result in arbitrary cancellation of flights greater in value to consumers than some retained.  Now, in the middle of this mess, FAA Administrator Donald Engen has announced that he\\'s quitting this summer out of frustration over pressure on the agency\\'s budget and pressure from the Reagan administration to auction landing rights among the airlines.  We have argued here before that one good way to achieve less airport congestion and fewer flight delays is indeed to ration the most desired landing slots by price. The FTC\\'s memorandum advised that the FAA \"impose additional limits on the number of slots during peak periods at the affected airports as needed,\" and that the agency then permit carriers to buy and sell the restricted slots. Under such a rationing system, airlines would pay a premium for peak-hour landing slots (currently, there is no price differential for peak and nonpeak slots). The airlines would likely pass this premium on to peak-hour travelers. Some would eventually opt for non-peak flights rather than pay higher peak-hour fares. Airport congestion would eventually abate.  These problems notwithstanding, Americans have benefited greatly from deregulation of the airline industry. More people are flying to more destinations at lower fares than even the most optimistic deregulators could have imagined in 1978. The challenge now is to create an air-travel management system appropriate to the level of consumer demand that obviously exists in the U.S.  The impediments to such a system are formidable. Airports tend to be viewed as public utilities. Expanding their capacity runs smack into local rules governing land use, noise, flight patterns, curfews. Debate drags on over privatizing air-traffic-control systems. Large, small and new airlines fight among themselves over proposed changes. In this atmosphere desperate people start grasping at re-regulation as the answer.  Re-regulation, however, is like saying there are too many cars, so let\\'s go back to the horse-pulled trolley system. It won\\'t happen. The crowded airline schedule is a problem requiring a large good-faith effort from both private and public parties. For the near term, the FAA will serve as a catalyst in this process. With Donald Engen\\'s decision to leave the agency, the Reagan administration has an opportunity to give the job to someone who has the instinct, skill and authority to give air travelers the same market benefits on the ground that they are now getting in the air.

       " 'WSJ870320-0168': 'The Strange Story of a Drug Regarded as Hero and Villain --- By Jerry E. Bishop Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> THE EPISODE WAS the kind that makes grist for novels and movies. A 40-year-old man suffering a severe liver disease had suddenly developed a life-threatening skin condition.  \"His skin was sloughing off all over his body,\" recalls Marshall M. Kaplan, the Tufts University gastroenterologist who had been tending the patient\\'s liver problems.  Cortisone wasn\\'t helping, \"so the question came up whether methotrexate would help,\" Dr. Kaplan says. Methotrexate is an old anti-cancer drug that had been found to aid certain other skin conditions, but it also has a dangerous side effect -- liver damage. The idea of using this drug in a man with a diseased liver was \"frightening,\" Dr. Kaplan says. \"But if we didn\\'t use it, there was a good chance he would die from the skin condition.\"  Balancing the risks, doctors began giving the man methotrexate. \"We watched his blood tests (for signs of liver damage), fully expecting them to get worse,\" Dr. Kaplan says. Instead, not only did his skin condition clear up, but to the doctors\\' astonishment, his liver began to improve. Now, eight years later, he takes maintenance doses of methotrexate, and both his skin and liver are normal.  THIS EPISODE, recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, marks another serendipitous incident in the strange history of methotrexate. In these days when genetic engineering and molecular manipulation turn up new wonder drugs almost weekly, methotrexate stands out as a baffling technological anomaly. In the 40 years since the drug was first synthesized, it has been alternately lauded as a treatment for a variety of human scourges and castigated as a poison whose risks are greater than the diseases it\\'s being used to treat. Yet no one is quite sure how or why it does what it does.  The methotrexate story begins in the mid-1940s when the late Sidney Farber and his colleagues at Children\\'s Hospital in Boston were attempting the first use of chemicals in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia, then an invariably fatal blood cancer.  The cancer researchers, according to an oft-told story, had noticed a similarity between the leukemia and a certain anemia which was due to a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid. This led them to treat the leukemia with folic acid. To their horror, the folic acid accelerated the leukemia instead of retarding it. This near-disaster, however, led them to try a second chemical, called aminopterin, that blocked the cancer cells\\' use of folic acid. In 1948, in an historic research paper, the Boston researchers reported the first remissions of acute leukemia through chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the remissions lasted only a few weeks or months.  The Boston discovery led chemists at Lederle Laboratories, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Cyanamid Co., to synthesize an improved version of aminopterin they called a-methopterin, to which Lederle\\'s marketing people affixed the brand name, Methotrexate (the brand name has since slid into generic use).  METHOTREXATE PROVED even better at bringing about remissions of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and today it is one of the drugs achieving cures of leukemia in about 50% of afflicted children. By 1956, cancer researchers reported another first: Women developing an unusual cancer of the placenta during pregnancy had been permanently cured by methotrexate, the first cancer ever cured by chemotherapy.  In the early 1960s, serendipity struck again. A New York dermatologist reported instances of some patients being relieved of psoriasis, a chronic and severely disturbing skin disease, when treated with methotrexate. This led William O\\'Brien and Roger Black at the National Institutes of Health to run a controlled trial on 21 psoriasis patients. Not only did the skin disorder clear up in several patients but so did a type of arthritis that often accompanies psoriasis. The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most common form of the crippling disorder.  But, in treating psoriasis patients, the dangers of methotrexate became apparent. In high doses and daily use, the drug can cause severe liver damage and sometimes a lung disorder.  IN SOME CANCER PATIENTS, doctors have worked out a unique \"rescue\" concept, giving a patient dangerously high doses of methotrexate to kill cancer cells and then shortly afterward administering an antidote to save normal tissues from its poisonous effects.  Methotrexate\\'s use in arthritis, at least for patients whose disease isn\\'t helped by any other drug, is now being revived. Researchers have treated several hundred arthritis patients with low doses of methotrexate given only once a week. Anywhere from half to two-thirds of these patients improve; some have remissions of their arthritis. But while many arthritis specialists are using methotrexate in \"refractory\" patients, others shun it. One is Dr. O\\'Brien, who did the first trial of methotrexate in arthritis and who is now a professor at the University of Virginia. Because of its toxicity, he says, \"we don\\'t use it anymore here in Charlottesville.\"  Meanwhile, in Boston, Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues say they had a second patient with the same severe liver disease as the first but without the skin problem. \"He was at his wits\\' end,\" Dr. Kaplan says. \"I thought of that first patient and said, \\'If you\\'re a gambler and you want to try methotrexate, we\\'ll do it.\\'\" The patient\\'s liver is now normal. A clinical trial of methotrexate in the liver disease, called primary sclerosis cholangitis, is now under way. ',\n",

When members of the 44-country lending organization gather in Miami this weekend for their annual meeting, the U.S. again will seek changes that effectively would give Washington the power to veto proposed IADB loans to member countries. Washington argues that as the organization\\'s largest donor it should have such say, but Latin countries oppose the idea as politically intolerable.  While neither side expects to resolve the dispute, each will be able to air views they have been expressing for some time in private, occasionally pushing negotiations into a more serious phase.  There is quite a bit at stake for the 27-year-old development bank. The Reagan administration has promised that if the organization\\'s members agree to the changes Washington is proposing, the U.S. will help finance a major expansion of lending resources to $20 billion over the next four years -- enough to make the institution a serious player in the effort to resolve the global debt problem. If the members don\\'t go along, Washington will contribute only enough to support $11 billion in new lending during that period.  U.S. policy makers complain that the bank often grants loans for political reasons rather than on economic merits. They also contend that the bank\\'s largely Latin staff isn\\'t tough enough about compelling borrowing countries to correct deficiencies in their economic policies.  For the bank to assume a larger role in resolving the debt problem, U.S. critics say, it will have to become more like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, which usually insist that borrowing countries take specific steps to overhaul their economies before granting them new loans.  According to U.S. officials, the IADB\\'s inadequacies stem from one basic flaw in the bank\\'s charter: the borrowing countries themselves control the distribution of funds. Unlike other international lending organizations, where weighted voting systems give the contributing countries a clear majority, the Inter-American Development Bank assigns 54% of its voting power to Latin countries. The U.S. has another 34.5% and the rest is split among 15 other donor countries.  As it currently takes at least a 50% vote to halt an IADB loan, the Latin countries can guarantee approval simply by voting as a bloc. Washington wants to change the bank\\'s rules so that loans could be turned down by just a 35% no vote. That way, the U.S., joined by any other industrial country, could veto loans it finds objectionable.  IADB staffers dispute criticisms that the organization is too lax, contending that Washington shouldn\\'t try to force all other countries to follow the U.S.\\'s own economic model. \"There are many ways to development, not just the one that\\'s in use here in the U.S.,\" says one official of the Washington-based organization.  Still, U.S. and Latin American negotiators have made substantial progress toward resolving their differences. The Latin Americans have agreed over the past several months to a spate of U.S. demands -- to earmark 25% of the bank\\'s loans to help countries restructure their economies, rather than for specific projects such as dams and roads; to channel a larger share of the total to the four big debtors, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela; to tie project loans to long-range economic restructuring programs; and to develop new procedures to coordinate the bank\\'s loans with those of the World Bank.  But the dispute over veto power has proved more thorny. Latin governments, loathe to give up an historic prerogative, are willing to reduce the veto threshhold to 40% of the vote, but they say it would cost them too much politically to accede to the full U.S. demand.  Most are under pressure at home to be more aggressive in standing up to the U.S. on economic and financial issues. Brazil\\'s recent move to suspend interest payments on commercial bank loans has only revived regional pressures to defy creditors.  Moreover, other donor governments aren\\'t supporting Washington\\'s veto demand. Only Canada has offered even lukewarm backing.  Following lower-level negotiations tonight and tomorrow morning, Treasury Secretary James Baker is scheduled to address the bank\\'s annual meeting, which begins formally on Monday. Treasury officials say Mr. Baker is likely to reiterate the U.S. position.  Both sides are running out of time to resolve the dispute. The bank is about to exhaust its current four-year operating budget and will need more funds. U.S. negotiators say the Reagan administration will have to decide within a few weeks how much Washington actually plans to contribute to the organization\\'s support. \"We\\'re down to brinksmanship,\" a U.S. negotiator says.

       " 'WSJ870320-0166': 'Church Militant</HL> Little more than a year ago, the people of the Philippines showed that faith could move dictators as well as mountains in the near bloodless ousting of Ferdinand Marcos. That was in response to a call from Jaime Cardinal Sin, archbishop of Manila, to go into the streets to protect the soldiers in rebellion. Today, with democracy restored and important elections due, the cardinal has told nuns and priests to go back to their churches.  The cardinal\\'s call came on the heels of the capture of one priest with New People\\'s Army rebels in Mindanao and the filing of weapons charges against another on Panay Island. These in turn followed a statement earlier that week by the respected head of the Filipino armed forces, Gen. Fidel Ramos, that the church had been infiltrated by communists.  To those who remember the cardinal\\'s dramatic call for action during the revolution, his concern about a politicized religious community might seem an about-face. In fact his is an eminently orthodox position. Against liberation theology, which sanctions an activist clerical role in state affairs, the cardinal\\'s emphasis is on the pastoral, involving the church directly only when the situation has gone beyond legitimate parameters or no other option exists. But with Marcos gone and Filipinos free to determine their future, Cardinal Sin sees no reason for his clerics to usurp the layman\\'s role in sorting out the particulars.  Thus the cardinal and his bishops have issued new guidelines to rule out the extremes and prevent abuses. Membership in groups advocating \"class struggle or violence as a means to social change\" is unequivocably forbidden, and priests are banned from running for or holding civil power without special permission. If they are to minister to people of all persuasions, the church must be -- and be seen to be -- above politics.  The argument therefore is not against a politically concerned church but a politicized church. The difference between the two is best illustrated by two other Catholic nations. In Nicaragua, priests are part and parcel of an anti-democratic ruling junta. In Poland, by contrast, the clergy prefers to spell out principles and exert influence through lay leaders. It\\'s no coincidence that one produces a Miguel d\\'Escoto and the other a Lech Walesa.  We\\'re not arguing that priests and nuns should be deprived of their civil rights. Nor for that matter does Cardinal Sin, whose guidelines reaffirm the clergy\\'s right to vote for whomever they want. We are concerned, however, that too often in North and South America and in Europe clerics have used their automatic status as religious leaders to push highly ideological, wholly secular agendas. There may still be a spiritual mission in there somewhere, but one would be hard put to identify it. What is especially noteworthy about Cardinal Sin\\'s actions in the Philippines now is the extent to which they reflect a subtle clerical intelligence, sensitive to balancing both the public and spiritual needs of his followers.

Guinness directors also have asked shareholders to remove Mr. Saunders and Mr. Ward from the board at the company\\'s annual meeting on May 27.

Yesterday, a statement by Mr. Ward\\'s attorneys said the $8.3 million is \"in his possession on deposit in the United States\" less amounts used to pay taxes \"and certain expenditures.\" The statement also contended that Guinness had refused his offer to put the money in escrow or to arbitrate his right to the money.

Ibrahim Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Saudi Arabia has cut its oil production close to a record low level in the battle to keep oil prices up, according to oil industry sources.  Saudi production has fallen to about 2.5 million barrels a day, down nearly a million barrels a day from a month ago and close to its lowest-ever daily output of two million barrels in August 1985, say sources among major U.S. customers for Saudi oil.  Oil production by most other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Qatar, Nigeria, Iran, Libya and Algeria, has also fallen. But the strongest source of resistance to oil company pressure to sell oil below the OPEC-mandated price of $18 a barrel seems to be Saudi Arabia.  \"Saudi Arabia\\'s King Fahd is by far the most prominent of OPEC leaders in the front line,\" notes Petrostrategies, a Paris-based trade publication. \"In all its 25-year history, this episode of resistance and sacrifice is by far the strongest demonstration of solidarity by OPEC,\" the publication\\'s editor, Pierre Terzian, says in an interview here.  OPEC and industry sources confirm that the cartel is producing a little more than 14.5 million barrels a day, compared with an authorized OPEC ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day.  Contributing to the shortfall appears to be unanimous OPEC resistance to sales of crude below the official price. Accidental interruptions of production, such as the earthquake that has halted Ecuador\\'s entire oil output of 210,000 barrels a day, also have held down output.  Reliable sources said tiny Qatar hasn\\'t been able to sell more than 65,000 barrels a day of an authorized OPEC quota of 285,000 barrels a day for the month of April. But a senior Qatari official, who asked not to be identified, said the country nevertheless will hold against all pressure \"because this is the political decision.\"  As a result, OPEC members are quickly devising plans to help their weaker members market oil in case the oil companies\\' challenge continues to erode their patience. Kuwait is reliably reported to be preparing to market Qatar\\'s oil through its vast network of refineries and distributors in Western Europe.  \"OPEC certainly seems to have a winning hand at the moment,\" says Steve Turner, an oil analyst with Wood, McKenzie &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in Edinburgh, Scotland. He shares with other analysts and industry observers the view that OPEC\\'s low production and high resolve are forcing oil companies to run down their oil inventories sharply.  Some analysts think the drawdown is running as high as 3.5 million barrels a day.

Net for the quarter ended Jan. 31 grew to $92.9 million, or 98 cents a share, from $78.3 million, or 82 cents a share, the year earlier.  The distiller said pre-tax operating profit rose 82% to $27.7 million from $15.2 million for the quarter. Sales increased 19% to $1.04 billion from $870.4 million. Profit from spirits and wine operations rose to $23.5 million from $104,000. A spokeswoman noted that year-earlier after-tax results were depressed by imposition of higher excise taxes.  The company's results also were largely affected by results of Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del. Seagram owns a 22.5% stake in the large chemical and energy concern. Equity in unremitted earnings of Du Pont fell 29% to $29.3 million from $41.3 million, while dividend income rose slightly to $40.4 million from $37.9 million.  Seagram earlier this month agreed to sell several of its wine operations for about $200 million to Vintners International Co., a new concern formed by the unit's former president and other investors. The sale involved Seagram's moderately priced domestic brands. The company said it is retaining more expensive wine brands.  For the full year, net rose 33% to $423.5 million, or $4.45 a share, from $319.1 million, or $3.44 a share, mainly reflecting Du Pont's sharply improved earnings. Seagram's sales rose 13% to $3.34 billion from $2.97 billion.  Seagram's unremitted earnings from Du Pont for the year more than doubled to $169.1 million from $75.7 million a year ago.

Profit included nonrecurring charges of $35 million associated with the sale of several wine operations and a planned reorganization of spirits operations in the U.S. Much of the effect of the charges was offset by a related reduction of tax expense by $27.7 million. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0158': 'Says It Will Sell South African Unit --- By Dennis Kneale Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> OFFICE EQUIPMENT (OFF) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> Xerox Corp., one of the last die-hard supporters of an American corporate presence in South Africa, finally succumbed to pressures here and abroad and said it will sell its South African unit.  Xerox said its 51%-owned Rank Xerox unit, whose 49% partner is Rank Organisation PLC, a Britain-based leisure and hotel company, will sell the local business to Altron Group, a big South African electronics firm. Terms weren\\'t disclosed for the sale, which is to be completed by May 1.  The pullout culminates more than a year of agonizing at Xerox, which in December held off a final decision as executives searched for a new approach that might let them stay in the racially troubled land. And the move is unlikely to ease the pressure from activists, who criticized Xerox\\'s plans yesterday to let the unit continue selling photocopiers in South Africa after its sale.  \"It\\'s a perfect example of a decision that basically pleases no one,\" David T. Kearns, Xerox chairman, said in an interview.  Nor does it please him. Mr. Kearns was one of industry\\'s most vocal proponents of the notion that only by staying can companies help end apartheid and repression in South Africa. His voice grew lonelier late last year when two other outspoken chairmen -- Roger B. Smith of General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.\\'s John F. Akers -- reversed course and pulled out.  Mr. Kearns said he still feels staying put is best for South Africa\\'s 23 million blacks. But he now says leaving is what is best for Xerox. \"It was clear things were continuing to deteriorate on all fronts,\" he said. The nation\\'s economy and social climate were worsening; pro-disinvestment groups\\' criticism was rising; and Xerox was beginning to lose sales in the U.S. to local governments that were banning contracts with companies doing business there.  The departure by Xerox, the 14th-largest U.S. employer in South Africa, comes at a critical time for U.S. firms. The pace of pullouts is accelerating, as pressure groups that once praised any departure now say simply leaving isn\\'t enough. The Reagan administration\\'s patient approach toward the South African government has been all but dismissed, even by a Reagan-appointed advisory panel. And a May 31 deadline looms for U.S. companies that follow the Sullivan Principles, fairness tenets that for 10 years provided a moral ground for profiting from sales in South Africa.  The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, founder of the principles, has said he will urge U.S. companies to leave South Africa if apartheid hasn\\'t ended by May 31 -- a seemingly impossible prospect. That might lead to waves of new withdrawals.  Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., became the 24th company to announce or complete a withdrawal in the first three months of this year. That compares with 49 corporations in all of 1986. The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center says 182 U.S. companies retain South African units and haven\\'t announced shutdown plans; the total was 267 companies less than a year ago.  The financial impact on Xerox will be puny -- the unit provided less than 1% of Xerox\\'s $9.78 billion of annual sales. Indeed, Xerox may have been more alarmed by the financial effects of staying. Last fall Xerox lost out on a photocopier contract with the Pittsburgh school board, which wouldn\\'t buy from South Africa-linked companies.  The lost sales were \"certainly a lot more than a few thousand dollars,\" Mr. Kearns said, \"and it is something we saw increasing\" unless Xerox pulled out. But he conceded he still may lose sales to such cities as Los Angeles, which has even tougher rules excluding companies that let their products be sold in South Africa even though they have shed direct investments there.  Most U.S. companies retain distribution agreements with the units they leave behind. Eastman Kodak Co. is one of the few that left and ended all product sales in South Africa. Richard Knight of the American Committee on Africa said cities will \"see that Kodak is clean and Xerox isn\\'t.\"  But Mr. Kearns countered that blocking all sales would leave workers without jobs and hurt the local units of customers Xerox supplies world-wide.  The criticism of Xerox comes despite the unusual efforts it made in pulling out. It negotiated a promise from the buyer that the unit\\'s 800-plus employees won\\'t lose their jobs. It also is forming a foundation run by black leaders that will spend $500,000 a year on social programs after Xerox leaves. ',\n",

Chase Econometrics puts GNP first-quarter growth at about a 2.5% annual pace, up from the paltry 1.1% in 1986\\'s fourth quarter; Wharton Econometric Forecasting is somewhat more bullish. Both say inventory building will help offset sluggish consumer outlays and weak capital spending. White House economist Sprinkel sticks to his 3.2% prediction for the year.  Some suggest that tax reform is causing short-term weakness in business investment, consumer spending and commercial construction. National Association of Manufacturers economist Jerry Jasinowski sees a \"quite large\" negative effect for the first half of the year. But public and private forecasters say that most of the problems are only temporary.  Officials say the chief question remains the impact of the dollar\\'s decline. \"Trade is our bottom line,\" says Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Bush\\'s GOP support plummeting to 28% from 43% last August; Dole climbs to 23% from 10%. Bush\\'s favorable ratings still exceed his negatives, but 54% of the public think that being Reagan\\'s vice president has hurt his presidential prospects. His hopes of breaking out of his political doldrums were further damaged by a \"60 Minutes\" interview last weekend.  Democrat Hart, with 36%, has four times more support than his nearest competitor, Jesse Jackson; the poll shows Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis next with 5%. Among all voters, Hart beats both Bush and Dole and, by 41% to 36%, voters prefer a Democratic to a Republican president in 1988. But the Colorado Democrat\\'s leftover debt from 1984 still plagues him.  WARMING TREND? The U.S. seeks a thaw with North Korea.  The recent decision to let U.S. diplomats talk to North Korean counterparts followed intelligence reports that Pyongyang wants to break out of its international isolation. The U.S. also feels pressure from China, which has improved its relations with Seoul and wants the U.S. to reciprocate.  Officials also hope to slow North Korea\\'s recent moves toward the Soviets and reduce chances for an Olympic boycott. But South Korea balks at U.S. advice to respond more favorably to recent overtures. It fears that the north is only trying to foment domestic unrest through the peace noises.  \"We\\'ve warned the U.S. that it won\\'t get anywhere with North Korea,\" says a South Korean official.  BOTTOMING OUT? Federal regulators say their list of problem banks, which grew by one a day in 1986, appears to be growing at about half that rate this year. But major troubles remain in the oil states, and FDIC Chairman Seidman says that a record 200 or more banks could go under this year.  MEESE\\'S TACTICS on judgeships draw fire from Senate GOP moderates. They complain he is dragging his feet and trying to see that only highly conservative candidates are named. Pennsylvania\\'s Heinz complains to chief of staff Baker, so far without results. Some members also suspect Meese of torpedoing ex-Sen. Gorton\\'s chances.  OFF AND RUNNING: The Brookings Institution\\'s Robert Reischauer is the early favorite to head the Congressional Budget Office. But the search is on hold while Congress wrestles with the budget; other candidates under consideration include congressional aides Van Ooms and Edward Gramlich, Brookings\\'s Joseph Pechman and Henry Aaron, and the Urban Institute\\'s Isabel Sawhill.  WELFARE OVERHAUL faces stiff political struggles, despite bipartisan agreement that changes are needed. Divisions remain on such major issues as whether some welfare payments should be raised. The administration expects easier agreement on proposals to set work requirements, which liberals may accept if support services such as child care are included.  DEMOCRATS JOSTLE over trade with an eye on the presidential race.  Hart resists calls for protectionism; he opposed textile restrictions in the Senate last year and has signaled his refusal to embrace quotas. But other presidential aspirants seek to woo labor with tough talk. Biden would threaten to let the dollar slide, or even link trade to the presence of U.S. troops in Japan and Germany.  Babbitt, who once used National Guard troops in a mining strike, now proposes stiff tariffs for nations that don\\'t reduce their trade surpluses. Dukakis doesn\\'t favor tariffs but says the U.S. may have to resort to \"tough stuff\" sometimes. Gephardt hopes for a public fight over his stringent amendment to the Ways and Means trade bill.  Some say Gephardt\\'s posturing hampers the panel\\'s work. \"If he weren\\'t running for president, it would be easier to deal with him,\" says Democratic Rep. Gibbons.

       " 'WSJ870320-0156': '--- Where the Bosses Are: Settling in Greenwich, Conn., May Not Make You a CEO -- But It Couldn\\'t Hurt --- By Roger Ricklefs</HL> Migrating Canada geese have always flown over the New York suburb of Greenwich, Conn. About a dozen years ago, many decided to become full-time residents.  Greenwich has water, meadows and bird-lovers who are generous with their gourmet bread crumbs. But plagued by goose droppings on its beach, the town finally brought out its biggest gun: a yacht-club cannon. The booms from blanks failed to budge the birds from some of America\\'s choicest real estate.  \"We have passed a law against feeding the birds now, but who\\'s going to arrest someone for feeding a goose?\" says Greenwich\\'s equivalent of a mayor, First Selectman John B. Margenot Jr.  As America\\'s corporate elite sees it, the birds know a good thing. Of all the suburbs where top executives have flocked since World War II, none has attracted so many as this town of 60,000, a 51-minute train ride from midtown Manhattan.  \"In terms of the number of chief executive officers of major companies who live there, no other place comes close,\" says Thomas J. Neff, president of the executive recruiters Spencer Stuart &amp; Associates and himself a Greenwich resident. The town today can claim -- besides such celebrities as David Stockman and Diana Ross -- current or recent chief executives of Exxon Corp., Citicorp, General Electric Co., American Express Co., PepsiCo Inc., GTE Corp., Union Pacific Corp., Combustion Engineering Inc. and others.  Greenwich is no idyllic retreat, no haven from sprawl, congestion, unhappiness, crime or drugs. Neither is it Middletown, U.S.A. In large parts of Greenwich, the minimum lot size is four acres. The median price of single-family houses sold there last year was $480,000.  The local high school -- whose principal is called a headmaster -- has been ranked among the nation\\'s best. It periodically sends its girls\\' lacrosse team to play in England. Yet 36% of Greenwich\\'s high school seniors say they get drunk or high on alcohol once a week a more.  On the surface, big white neo-Colonial houses on vast lawns make this town look as if it might never change. But Greenwich, like other executive towns, is changing.  For one thing, the affluent have become more so. Membership in a single country club was once a luxury. Now, many residents belong to two or even three.  \"The yacht club near us is only open in summer, so we belong to another one for winter entertainment,\" says the wife of a recently retired New York mining executive. In Vermont, where they summer, the couple belong to yet another club.  Life in the clubs is changing, too. Reflecting today\\'s exercise craze, strenuous sports such as tennis and squash are gaining ground fast, says John Moreland, general manager of the Greenwich Country Club. Interest in gourmet dining is rising. When the club recently scheduled a $200-a-couple dinner, it had to draw up a waiting list. \"Ten years ago, this wouldn\\'t have gone over,\" Mr. Moreland says.  Greenwich homeowners have plenty of assets, on paper at least, to cover their bills for pheasant terrine. Soaring real estate values have seen to that. Last year, one in seven houses sold there fetched more than $1 million, and one went for more than $11 million. A service station owner says he recently sold his house there for $500,000 to build a better one.  Simple clapboard houses on ordinary city lots can still be found -- at $250,000. More Greenwichers than in the past have bought one or more \"second homes\" in New England, Florida, the Caribbean or New York City. \"The person who used to have two houses now has four,\" says Carl W. Menk, chairman of Canny, Bowen Inc., executive recruiters in New York.  The standard of living for children seems to have risen even more. Instead of parking the kids with Grandma, parents take them to Europe; Mr. Neff\\'s two sons are traveling with him to the Bahamas this spring and to England this summer.  About half the students at Greenwich High own or have access to a home computer, says David Quattrone, headmaster.  Girls\\' lacrosse isn\\'t the only vehicle for foreign adventure. The school\\'s idea of a Western Civilization class trip is a yearly pilgrimage to France, Italy or Greece, and about a third of the class goes. Of 700 seniors, 500 have parking permits, according to Mr. Quattrone. But, he adds, \"only a few\" have Mercedes-Benzes or BMWs.  \"Kids here can grow up with an unbalanced view of what the world is like,\" says Stephen Brecher, partner in the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. in New York. But like many parents there, he says the quality of the school system was a \"key reason\" he moved to Greenwich.  In fact, executive suburbs such as Greenwich seem to be holding their coveted position in U.S. education. A few years ago, a survey of college admissions officers and high school principals ranked the high school there in the nation\\'s top 12.  About a quarter of the students qualify for advanced college placement in at least one subject. Around 200 of the high school students a year take calculus, commonly a college-level course, Mr. Quattrone says. Teachers earn as much as $45,000 a year, and their classes average only 20 students each.  But about a quarter of the town\\'s students attend private schools. At the Brunswick School, a boys\\' day school, mandatory Latin starts in the seventh grade. Many students take calculus there, too.  Students are concerned with doing well. But many suffer from \"fear that they won\\'t be able to match their parents\\' achievements,\" says Norman A. Pedersen, headmaster of Brunswick.  \"The parents don\\'t have to say a word,\" he says. \"It\\'s in the culture.\" The pressure to perform contributes to teenage drinking and drug-taking, some Greenwichers say. Others point to busy parents\\' frequent absences for business or pleasure.  \"The party scene revolves around houses where parents are absent for the weekend,\" Mr. Quattrone says.  Whatever the causes, the problems worry Greenwich. In a poll of 4,355 youngsters three years ago, 15% of the high school seniors -- and 4% of the seventh graders -- said they used marijuana at least once a week. Moreover, 57% of seniors and 12% of eighth-graders said they drank at least once a week. Five percent of the town\\'s eighth-graders said they were getting drunk or high on liquor at least once a week.  One parent recalls a high school student so drunk he passed out in class -- at 10 a.m. In a thriving volunteer program called Safe Rides, teen-agers give rides to other youngsters too drunk to drive.  \"You just can\\'t overestimate the problem,\" says the Rev. John W. Bishop, rector of Christ Episcopal Church. But the youngsters aren\\'t alone in their problem. An Alcoholics Anonymous group that meets at the church Friday evenings is so packed \"you can\\'t find a parking place,\" Father Bishop says.  In at least one important way, the pressure on adults is easing significantly in towns such as Greenwich. As more companies move to the suburbs, hundreds of executives are putting the train ride to the city behind them.  \"Ten years ago, the bulk of people who commuted went to New York,\" says Mr. Moreland, the country club manager. \"Now, more than half commute to towns in the area.\"  Life also is changing in other ways. Even among women in their 50s who are married to senior executives, about a quarter now hold jobs, Father Bishop estimates. And of Greenwich women in their 30s and 40s married to executives, probably 60% to 70% have jobs, he says.  \"After people ask you what you are up to 750 times, you think, \\'Now I have to be up to something,\\'\" says Cecie Munkenbeck, wife of a corporate executive who started a landscape design career in her late 50s.  The environmental movement is thriving. If there is one thing that America\\'s premier corporate bedroom doesn\\'t want, it seems to be more business. In recent years, several companies, such as Chesebrough-Pond\\'s Inc., have moved their headquarters to Greenwich or nearby towns. To try to hold down congestion, Greenwich imposed two moratoriums on office building in the past decade; and after each one was lifted, restrictions were tightened.  \"My biggest source of complaints is expansion of office buildings,\" Mr. Margenot, the first selectman, says. Now, Greenwich is fighting the proposed expansion of a corporate headquarters just across the city line in Stamford. Workers driving to the office crowd a Greenwich street, residents say. Some even propose making the street one-way: away from the office in the morning, toward it in the afternoon.  In the long run, another change now taking place may become the most significant one: The people of Greenwich are becoming more diverse.  As in some other suburbs favored by corporate elites, many residents years ago resisted selling their homes to Jews. Even today, many country clubs have few Jewish members.  But Greenwich\\'s Jewish population has grown to between 4,000 and 5,000 -- triple the figure of 20 years ago, says Rabbi Hillel Silverman, leader of a Jewish congregation there. He says Jews no longer encounter problems buying homes in Greenwich.  At Greenwich High School, minority-group enrollment, about equally divided among black, Hispanic and Asian students, has climbed to 10% of the student body from 6.5% in 1980, Mr. Quattrone says. The minorities\\' representation in the total town population is smaller but still significant.  Many descendants of black servants live in modest Greenwich frame houses, and a few more middle-class blacks are moving in. But as real estate prices rise, black and white residents are coming to share a fear that their children won\\'t live as adults in the kind of town they knew as children.  Nancy C. Brown, a black town official whose husband\\'s family has lived there for three generations, says her son \"would love to live in Greenwich.\" The son, a computer graphics artist, has bought a house in nearby -- but less expensive -- Stamford.  \"There\\'s no question about it,\" she says, \"people have a real fear of being squeezed out.\"  --- Mr. Ricklefs, based in The Wall Street Journal\\'s New York bureau, is a national correspondent.  ---  Greenwich: A Profile Distance from Wall Street                   38 miles Founded                                     1640 Size                                        50.6 square miles Population                                  60,000 Median age                                  39.6 years Median household income                     $55,000 Median cost of single family house          $480,000 Percentage of single family homes for sale for over $1 million                25% Commuters out of town daily                 18,000 Commuters into town daily                   27,000 Public education spending per pupil         $4,836 Average public school class size            20 students Percentage of public school grads who go to 4-year college                    69% Top teachers\\' salary                        $45,000 Number of public schools                    13 Number of private schools                   9 Unemployment rate                           1.8% Number of restaurants                       75 Number of country clubs                     10 Number of churches                          41 Sources: Greenwich Public Schools, Town of Greenwich, Greenwich Chamber of Commerce, Greenwich Board of Realtors ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0155': 'Genex Recruits Frashier to Polish Image; New Chief Sets Plans for the Long Haul --- By Alfredo Corchado Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Genex Corp. said it recruited Gary E. Frashier as president and chief executive officer in an effort to \"improve the image\" of the struggling biotechnology concern.  Mr. Frashier, 50 years old, has been chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Water Systems Corp., a San Antonio, Texas-based unit of Olin Corp., which produces ultra-pure water for scientific use. He succeeds J. Leslie Glick, 46, who resigned in January at the behest of Genex\\'s chairman and largest stockholder, Robert F. Johnson.  Genex hopes Mr. Frashier can restructure the company by shedding some lackluster operations and pushing for new products. \"He has the kind of commercial savvy we need,\" said a company official. \"He understands the industrial markets we serve.\"  Under Mr. Glick, Genex had pinned most of its hopes on Proto, an enzyme-based drain cleaner that isn\\'t corrosive. That Proto strategy had been to build a broad customer base among hospitals, colleges, restaurants and various other institutions.  But Mr. Frashier considers that approach too fragmented to be effective. \"I don\\'t think cleaning products are the future for Genex,\" he said. Genex has held talks with several companies about selling the Proto license, Mr. Frashier said, but he declined to identify any prospective buyers.  Genex has been floundering since 1985, when it lost a big contract to supply raw materials for aspartame, an artificial sweetener made by Monsanto Co.\\'s G.D. Searle &amp; Co. unit. Sales to Searle had accounted for 58% of Genex\\'s annual revenue. The loss of the contract forced Genex to dismiss 40% of its work force and post a $15.9 million loss that year. For the first nine months of 1986, Genex reported a loss of $2.4 million. Earlier this month, the company arranged a $4 million line of credit with four venture-capital groups.  Mr. Frashier is betting that Genex\\'s new \"affinity\" proteins still under development will have greater commercial success. These proteins bind tightly to specific molecules, offering the prospect of such applications as the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the separation and purification of materials. In addition, Mr. Frashier will push for development of a line of protein-based adhesive and coating products.  \"I think our chances of commercial success are greater in these areas (than in cleaning products), though we have to do it carefully and thoroughly,\" Mr. Frashier said.  A chemical engineer by training, Mr. Frashier is a former executive of Loctite Corp., an adhesives maker, and once headed three divisions of Millipore Corp., a maker of purification and separation products. In 1984, he organized a management buyout of one of those divisions, Continental Water Systems, which Olin acquired recently.  Mr. Frashier, who also was named a director at Genex, doesn\\'t expect any quick fixes at the company. \"I wouldn\\'t call myself a turnaround specialist,\" he said. \"I plan to be here for the long haul.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0153': '--- Running the Show Italian Style: With Raul Gardini at the Helm, Ferruzzi Group Has Taken on the Personality of Its Top Hand --- By Philip Revzin</HL> Most top executives have a little weekend place where they can escape the pressures of the office. Raul Gardini\\'s retreat is a dozen-room \"palazzo\" built in 1487 on Venice\\'s Grand Canal, just a gondola\\'s ride from St. Mark\\'s Square.  Nouveau this is not. The silver-haired, lightly tanned Mr. Gardini, chairman of Italy\\'s Ferruzzi Group, entertains a visitor at Ca\\'Dario in a room that glows in a riot of 17th-century and 18th-century furniture, a 19th-century copy of a 15th-century ceramic stove and a Murano glass chandelier. Pouring 10-year-old brandy from a crystal decanter, Mr. Gardini shares his thoughts on his work style.  \"I work as long as I need to, but not for the sake of working,\" he says.  Ferruzzi, with interests in sugar, chemical and agricultural businesses, is Italy\\'s third largest private company and an increasing power in European industry. It is an enterprise with $8 billion a year in sales and 15,000 employees. It also is one that the 52-year-old Mr. Gardini manages to escape from -- Venice is some 80 miles from his office and principal home in Ravennan -- early every weekend. There\\'s a telephone in the wood-paneled elevator that serves Ca\\'Dario\\'s wood-paneled dining room, but Mr. Gardini gives the distinct impression that any calls had better be important. \"I trust my managers,\" he says. \"I leave them to do their jobs. Management is people, and what counts is results.\"  Executives everywhere value results. But European executives such as Mr. Gardini, more than their American counterparts, also value a style that enables them to imbue their enterprises with their personalities, to revel in their culture and history, to take their weekends and four or five weeks of vacation a year and still get the job done.  \"The American executive is probably harder working than the Italian or French one,\" says Egon Zehnder, an international management consultant based in Zurich. \"It\\'s rare to see a top American executive take more than two weeks vacation straight. But you can\\'t reach anybody in August in France or Italy.\"  To Mr. Zehnder the main difference between American and Italian executives lies in their imagination and intuition. \"The American is a well-structured individual, knows the rules, his limitations and his job description, and acts accordingly,\" Mr. Zehnder says. \"The Italian probably doesn\\'t have a job description, and if he does he doesn\\'t pay any attention to it.\"  Although individual executives often defy national stereotypes, experience shows that a certain reality underlies them. The stereotypes class German executives as strict followers of the rules, formal and correct to the point of coolness with employees and clients. Swiss executives also adhere to the rules but smile occasionally. The French honor some rules, smile and make sure the wine is properly served at lunch.  But the Italians, ah . . . .   In Italy, says Mr. Zehnder, \"The emotion is all part of the show. The boss can blow his top and the relationship doesn\\'t suffer. In terms of a relaxed, informal atmosphere in the office it\\'s probably closest to the U.S., except that nobody in Italy uses first names.\"  These days in Italy the stereotype is bending a little, and Mr. Gardini prides himself on being part of the vanguard of a new breed of professional manager, not at all a part of the \"establishment,\" the few old families that still run much of Italian industry.  Born into a Ravenna farming family, Mr. Gardini studied agricultural science in school and joined Ferruzzi in 1955. Two years later, he married the daughter of the firm\\'s founder, Serafino Ferruzzi. At the time, the agricultural firm\\'s affairs were cloaked in a tradition of secrecy and reticence. Its recent purchase of a 25% interest in Montedison, the publicly traded chemical giant, has changed that. Ferruzzi has muscled its way into the industrial establishment, and the mystery that surrounded the firm has begun to dissolve.  The company finally created a public relations department, for example. Several affiliates are now publicly traded and must disclose their finances. Mr. Gardini, thrust into public view, often is being referred to as Italy\\'s third industrial titan, joining Fiat\\'s Gianni Agnelli and Olivetti\\'s Carlo De Benedetti. While their wealth still may exceed his, Mr. Gardini certainly has become one of the tiny fraction of Italians whose income would make them multimillionaires anywhere.  The senior titans, Messrs. Agnelli and De Benedetti, spend a lot of their off-hours at seminars and colloquiums, expounding on their management philosophy and world view. Mr. Gardini shuns such affairs, preferring to curl up with a good book at Ca\\'Dario. His reading centers on agriculture and sports, but he also tackles Faulkner, Dos Passos and Hemingway, in translation. He is a fervent duck hunter.  Unlike most other top executives in Italy, Mr. Gardini doesn\\'t speak English, though he is fluent in French. He also has managed to avoid being pigeonholed and nicknamed by the media. Mr. Agnelli is \"the Lawyer.\" Mr. De Benedetti is \"the Engineer.\" Mr. Gardini has been called \"the Farmer\" and \"the Pharaoh,\" the latter for reasons that have vaguely to do with his financial ability, but neither epithet has stuck.  Mr. Gardini smiles broadly over that. \"I\\'m delighted that I can\\'t be categorized,\" he says. \"I\\'m different.\"  He is different, too, in his approach to running the show. Mr. Agnelli, Fiat\\'s patriarch, leaves no doubt as to who is in charge of all aspects of the business. A show of control is less important to Mr. Gardini. While he seems totally self-assured, he can also be reticent. He is more charming than charismatic.  \"People here always are saying that I\\'m the new boss of this company or that company that we acquire,\" Mr. Gardini says, tapping his eighth Winston of the evening into a crystal ashtray, his right eyelid drooping almost shut. \"I\\'m not the boss at all. The managers are the bosses. They report to me, sure, but the day-to-day concerns are theirs, not mine.\"  The executive says he generally keeps his dealings confined to a core group of 10 or so executives at the Ravenna headquarters, which is located in Serafino Ferruzzi\\'s old home. He prefers to visit his executives in their offices, not summon them to his, and when he visits Ferruzzi facilities he has no special office set aside for himself. \"Just give me a chair and I can get done what I need to,\" he says.  Mr. Gardini has dealt with American executives. He seems to differ most from them in his longer-term thinking, which envisions the distant past as well as the distant future. He shudders at the image of a U.S. executive at a chrome-topped desk in a steel and glass skyscraper \"with the computer screen flashing three-month projections.\" He says: \"It\\'s all too short-term in the U.S. Nothing connects.\"  During weekends at Ca\\'Dario -- and some weekday mornings before work, when he arises at 6 a.m. to stroll to the office at 8 -- Mr. Gardini enjoys the luxury of simply thinking.  Europe\\'s business future lies in pan-European companies, Mr. Gardini believes, and he is trying to make Ferruzzi one of them. It already owns Beghin-Say, the French sugar maker. (Ferruzzi was recently blocked in its bid for control of S&amp;W Berisford Ltd., parent of British Sugar Corp., which would have made the Italian company the world\\'s biggest sugar producer, with 25% of the European market.)  Pan-European companies such as that, Mr. Gardini believes, will be big enough competitors to play in the same league with American and Japanese industrial giants. He also thinks about taking Ferruzzi public. Sooner or later, he says, it must become publicly held.  As Mr. Gardini talks, the weekend draws to a close. He hops into Ca\\'Dario\\'s motor launch for the 30-minute ride to Venice\\'s airport, where Ferruzzi\\'s nine-seater jet takes him to Paris for a business meeting. \"We\\'ve got to think wider and broader, not just Italian,\" he says during the flight. \"That goes for cultural and philosophical interests, not just business.\"  For instance, Mr. Gardini says, he is worried increasingly by pollution in Europe and the need to find new solutions, rather than, as in the past, export waste down rivers or out smokestacks to drift across borders. Ferruzzi has invested heavily in ethanol plants, including one that just opened in Louisiana, which turn surplus grains and sugar into a gasoline additive that replaces lead. If ethanol catches on, it would be profitable as well as ecologically sound.  Beyond ethanol, Mr. Gardini also expounds thoughtfully and passionately on the need to solve North-South tensions while continuing to improve agricultural productivity. He worries about South America, which he calls \"a real disaster,\" and about agricultural trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe, which he calls \"a real war.\"  These problems must be solved \"by heads\" -- he taps his -- \"not fists.\" He talks of the \"new agriculture,\" a variation of the \"Green Revolution,\" involving different crops for different needs. Ferruzzi, for its part, single-handedly launched soybean production in Italy and is trying to start a cotton-growing industry there. \"These,\" he says, \"are the sorts of things that mean something.\"  --- Mr. Revzin is The Wall Street Journal\\'s Paris bureau chief.

       " 'WSJ870320-0147': '--- Outplace Those Terminators: Simply Saying \\'You\\'re Fired\\' Isn\\'t Easy But It\\'s the Mark of a Classy Dismissal --- By Robert Johnson</HL> \"You know, Phil, there are times in a man\\'s career when . . . I mean, it\\'s always important to consider your options, and I think it\\'s more and more important in your career now. You know, Phil, there are a lot of reasons for it, and I guess I\\'m not saying this very well, and as a matter of fact, I\\'m operating on orders from on high -- but I think you should accelerate the process of keeping your options open. Decisions are being made, if you know what I mean.  \"Listen, Phil, if you want to continue this, let\\'s go have a drink. But I\\'ll tell you now, you\\'ve been loyal to us for 15 years, that\\'s real loyalty, and I know this is tough. But as strange as it may seem, Phil, just remember this is the first day of the rest of your life. Really, that\\'s all I have to say, except that while this is an ending, it\\'s not like an ending-ending, you know. You\\'ll get your checks for a while, at least. Look, this is Friday. On Monday, I\\'ll see Personnel and find out just how long you\\'ll get \\'em.\"  By now, Phil may have caught the drift. He\\'s being fired by his well-intentioned superior -- in a mock firing staged by Steven G. Harrison, a New York outplacement consultant.  It\\'s a sloppy firing that a beginning firer can easily manage. But the supreme test of executive skill is firing with grace. It happens to be the most dreaded test of executive skill, too.  It\\'s so shunned that although most managers going up the ladder are occasionally required to fire, once having ascended to the top they delegate the job. Andrew Sherwood, a New York management consultant, says that only about 5% of chief executives do their own firing. \"These are people who are compulsive builders,\" he says. \"They like acquiring companies, making profits go up, and recruiting people. Firing isn\\'t what they\\'re emotionally geared for. They find it repugnant.\"  Peter Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer of Progressive Insurance Co. in Cleveland, says that firing his president of 13 years in 1983 \"was tougher than divorcing my wife.\"  \"Fire\" is a four-letter word, and the implications aren\\'t lost on most executives. \"We ought to get that word out of the lexicon,\" says A. Robert Abboud, former chairman of First Chicago Corp. \"It\\'s a crudity.\" The word crept into common usage about 100 years ago as a pun on \"discharge.\" By now, \"discharge\" has become a euphemism, along with newer ones like \"terminate,\" \"dismiss,\" and \"let go.\" Sooner or later, no doubt, unwanted employees will simply be \"outplaced.\"  Humor is said to succeed by exposing frightening or indelicate realities of the human condition in the form of hyperbole, or slapstick. Cartoonist Chic Young and his son and successor, Dean Young, made the firing scenes in their comic strip, \"Blondie,\" a part of American folklore. Firing is a way of life at Dithers &amp; Co., where Julius C. Dithers, founder of the construction concern, has axed Dagwood Bumstead hundreds of times over the years.  Mr. Dithers\\'s style is to creep up on Dagwood, who is often either tardy or asleep at work, and yell in his ear. Then he follows up with a swift kick in the pants, or he literally tosses Dagwood out of the office.  It hardly needs saying that no one in American business fires quite like Mr. Dithers. But, says Dean Young, \"A lot of people tell me he\\'s the quintessential boss.\"  The reason is simple: If \"fire\" is, as Mr. Abboud says, a \"crudity,\" firing is a hostile act; Mr. Dithers shows just how hostile. Firing threatens an employee and his family with the loss of their livelihood. It illuminates a grim fact that the employee is viewed as an economic factor, and a not very productive one at that. Never is it a joy.  Firing with grace -- with style -- takes all that into account but minimizes the consequences that lie within the power of the employer to manage. Simple kindness may move employers to master the art of firing. But there are other motives. The way an employee is fired affects the motivation and morale of remaining employees, as well as potential employees. It may damage the company\\'s reputation with customers who deal with the fired employee. It may result in expensive litigation. It may also affect the company\\'s reputation among shareholders and others.  Mr. Abboud says that tactful firing requires \"a sense of artistry and maybe a little guile.\" At First Chicago, he says, \"I was sometimes guilty of not gilding the lily, of coming right to the heart of the matter.\" Yet his directness earned him a reputation for abrasiveness. He himself was forced to resign as First Chicago\\'s chairman at a board meeting in 1980.  To avoid brutality, some executives, like Phil\\'s superior, become too oblique when firing. \"I wrote a note (firing) one of my headquarters workers whose job had been eliminated by a new computer. But she didn\\'t catch on in the slightest,\" says C. Robertson Trowbridge, president of Yankee Publishing Inc., in Dublin, N.H. \"Two weeks later she was still there.\"  Mr. Trowbridge violated one rule of firing by doing it in writing rather than in person. But he observes two other rules to make firing easier. For one, he doesn\\'t hire friends or relatives of friends. He once had to fire the wife of a man who played in a band with him on weekends. \"You don\\'t want to alienate your clarinet player,\" he says. Second, he doesn\\'t fire on Friday. \"I don\\'t want to wonder all weekend how he\\'s taking it at his home,\" he says. \"It\\'s better to do it on Monday, and give him the whole week to chase down his pals and pick up on some new leads.\"  Others say Tuesday is better. If a firing is scheduled for Monday, the boss is still likely to spend all weekend fretting over the prospect -- and the boss\\'s morale is important, too.  Half an hour before lunchtime is probably the most propitious time, says Mr. Harrison, who is president of Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. in New York. That\\'s because the employee will probably want to leave the office for a while afterward.  Mr. Harrison\\'s firm has prepared a brochure called \"Termination Guidelines: How to Avoid the Pitfalls.\" It stresses planning. Before firing, for example, the employer should write a letter explaining the employee\\'s separation benefits; the shock of being fired is likely to obliterate or garble the explanation he gets during his firing. The employer should give the employee the letter immediately after the firing.  For most executives, the hardest thing is what to say. Mr. Harrison suggests that Phil\\'s boss should have said something like this:  \"Phil, we have reached a decision, although it is not the happiest. Effective now, you are no longer employed here.  \"Some of the reasons you already know. But the important thing now is what comes next. We\\'ll give you help in getting employment. Just because it didn\\'t work out here doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t work out elsewhere. I\\'m giving you a paper explaining your benefits, including salary continuation and outplacement counseling. You will have about four months\\' salary, including vacation time, and your medical benefits will continue while you\\'re on salary.\"  Some executives would rather begin by reciting the employee\\'s virtues and recalling his contributions to the company. But one executive who tried that says the \"firee\" interrupted him to ask for a raise. \"You must first tell the person outright that this talk isn\\'t to discuss whether he\\'s leaving but the circumstances of his departure,\" says Charles C. Jett, a Chicago executive recruiter.  Above all, Mr. Harrison says, the person doing the firing should avoid buckpassing (\"I\\'m operating on orders from on high\") and platitudes (\"This is the first day of the rest of your life.\")  Still, says Daniel T. Carroll, former president and chief executive officer of Hoover Universal Inc., in Ann Arbor, Mich., it\\'s never easy. \"You can teach what happens in a firing episode,\" he says. \"But each one is so different that the advice may be misleading.\"  Mr. Carroll himself was fired from Hoover, now a subsidiary of Johnson Controls Inc., Milwaukee, in 1982. \"It was very brief,\" he says. \"The directors didn\\'t want to go in the direction I wanted. They asked for my resignation.\" Today he is his own boss as an independent consultant in Ann Arbor. \"There\\'s no one here to fire me,\" he says.  --- Mr. Johnson is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal\\'s Chicago bureau.

And Katharine Graham of the Washington Post Co. inherited the job, which both her father and her husband held.  Soon, however, Fortune 500 directors may be turning more and more to women when they tap new chief executive officers. \"It\\'s inevitable,\" says Rand Corp. economist James P. Smith. \"Large numbers of women are in the middle-management pipeline now, and in 10 years you\\'ll see far more than one in the CEO ranks.\"  Executive women on the rise are choosing untraditional routes to the top. Instead of climbing a single corporate ladder rung by rung, some women are zigzagging their way higher, moving from company to company, industry to industry or from the private sector to public service and back again. Others are departing from the usual big business management routes to nurture -- or acquire -- companies of their own. And some women develop so much expertise in new, technology-linked fields that they can\\'t be overlooked.  Here are five of the women who, experts say, stand a better-than-even chance of becoming Fortune 500 chief executives by 1997:  DEBORAH COLEMAN Vice President, Operations, Apple Computer Inc.  Her dream was to run a factory and combine \"the best manufacturing technology with the best people-management.\" When she joined Apple Computer Inc. in 1981 as controller of the Macintosh division, she struck a pact with company founder Steven Jobs to let her run the new Macintosh plant if she built the best finance team in the industry.  Today, 34-year-old Deborah A. Coleman is known throughout Silicon Valley as a high-technology manufacturing wizard. At Apple\\'s Fremont, Calif., Macintosh plant, where several of her predecessors had been fired, she ended production havoc in six months -- eliminating computer-driven equipment that wasn\\'t \"people friendly,\" slashing inventory and boosting productivity.  \"A lot of what I did was common sense,\" says Ms. Coleman, who routinely pulled everyone in the plant together to set monthly goals and, as she puts it, \"foster a shared vision.\" As a result, assembly line workers agreed to work 12-hour shifts at times to meet certain production schedules, and the labor rate was reduced to less than 30 minutes for each Macintosh.  Promoted to vice president of manufacturing in 1985, Ms. Coleman promptly reduced Apple\\'s inventory 37%, introduced new delivery schedules and cut the number of vendors the company uses more than one-third, to less than 300.  Currently in charge of Apple\\'s plants in Ireland, Singapore and California, the single Ms. Coleman, who holds an M.B.A. from Stanford University, hopes to \"work myself out of this job within two years.\" She predicts that as Apple grows, the company will be reorganized into separate business units, \"and I wouldn\\'t mind running one of those major businesses.\"  KAREN HORN Chairman and CEO-Elect, Banc One -- Cleveland Unit.  She has moved from the private sector to public service and back again, jumping several management rungs each time. The leap Karen Horn will make next month from president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp.\\'s Cleveland unit, with $1.4 billion in assets, will make her the highest-ranking woman in U.S. banking.  The 43-year-old Mrs. Horn is known as a consummate strategist and crisis manager. At the Fed she helped resolve Ohio\\'s thrift crisis in 1985, when the failure of Home State Savings Bank triggered a panic and prompted the closing of dozens of privately insured thrifts. She quickly scattered regulators across the state to identify troubled thrifts. Recognizing that Ohio\\'s insurance pool wouldn\\'t even cover Home State\\'s losses, she also instituted a plan to monitor deposit withdrawals at the other institutions insured by the fund to forestall other failures.  But it is her ability to lead others that should help Mrs. Horn strengthen Banc One and that makes her an attractive potential candidate to head a non-banking concern. \"She has a presence that drives the best in people,\" says Linda Page, Ohio\\'s banking commissioner. \"She\\'ll look at you in a very engaging way and say, \\'Tell me about that.\\' You can see her mind churning with thoughts, but she always makes you feel that you\\'re helping resolve the problem.\"  Mrs. Horn says she devotes as much time as possible to her husband of 21 years and their 4-year-old son. But she rejects the label \"superwoman.\" \"I haven\\'t met one yet,\" she says. \"I do a lot of things at home and in business, but I have a lot of people helping me.\"  Kay Koplovitz President and CEO, USA Network  She started her career as a television producer in Milwaukee and soon concluded that \"the best way to get to the top for a woman is to start at the top with a business of her own. If I\\'d stayed in Milwaukee, I never would have made it to station manager.\"  Kay Koplovitz founded USA Network in 1980 and shaped it to become the No. 1 cable network in terms of viewership and the first to use on-air advertisers. Today the network provides around-the-clock programming to 33 million households through 8,500 systems. And with revenue last year of about $80 million, USA Network -- jointly owned by Time Inc., Gulf &amp; Western Inc.\\'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit and MCA Inc. -- is continuing to grow 20% to 30% annually.  What has set USA Network apart is its diverse programming. Ms. Koplovitz, who is 41, was the first to negotiate national cable rights to major-league sports. She also launched an award-winning children\\'s program series as well as adult dramas and movies.  \"Instead of simply carving out one little niche like a lot of cable companies, she\\'s taken on a mix of distinguished programming,\" says Mel Harris, president of Paramount\\'s television group and a member of USA Network\\'s executive committee. \"She could handle a Fortune 500 board.\"  Married to attorney William Koplovitz Jr., she says, \"I wanted to be president of CBS when I started in television. But my job now may be more challenging. We\\'re the upstarts trying to chip into the broadcast guys\\' territory.\"  COLOMBE NICHOLAS President, Christian Dior America She familiarized the U.S. with the French name Dior and changed Dior\\'s image from matronly to youthful. Her strategy boasted an advertising campaign that featured the escapades of a raffish menage a trois.  While company licensees at first were nervous that the ads were too risque, the campaign hooked consumers. Under Colombe Nicholas\\'s direction, revenue at Christian Dior America has more than doubled in the past six years, to $315 million in 1986. The number of licensees making Dior products has jumped 45%.  Before taking over Dior\\'s American arm, the 41-year-old Ms. Nicholas spent 10 years in New York retailing -- at Macy\\'s and Bloomingdale\\'s and at Bonwit Teller, where she was vice president of merchandising. But she believes her international background -- and fluency in French -- gave her the edge over several contenders for the Dior job.  The eldest daughter of an Ohio-businessman father and a French mother, Ms. Nicholas spent part of her childhood in Switzerland. At her father\\'s insistence, she also acquired a law degree. \"I hated law school, but now I thank my father every day,\" she says. \"I learned how to think analytically.\"  Married to art collector Leonard Rosenberg, Ms. Nicholas describes herself as \"very goal-focused\" and \"a risk taker,\" but isn\\'t a workaholic, she says. She rarely gets to her office before 9:30 a.m. and says, \"When I meet someone who tells me they\\'ve been up since 5, jogged 10 miles and gotten five kids off to school, I ask, \\'Where\\'s the coffee?\\'\"  Since it isn\\'t likely that Christian Dior America will be spun off or go public, Ms. Nicholas would have to move to another company to become a Fortune 500 CEO. A multinational marketing concern would be her most likely move, executive recruiters say. She doesn\\'t rule out that possibility, but says she also is considering a switch to politics. \"We need more women in government,\" she says, \"and a business background there could be very relevant.\"  LINDA WACHNER President, Warnaco Inc. She calls herself \"the first woman to succeed at the takeover game,\" a strategy that she figures was her swiftest route to the top.  Determined to head a large company, Linda Wachner last year spearheaded a leveraged buyout of Warnaco Inc., the Bridgeport, Conn.-based apparel manufacturer of Hathaway shirts, Pringle sweaters and a score of other well-known brands. Her goal is to make Warnaco \"the foremost apparel conglomerate in the world\" by doubling last year\\'s sales of $575 million in five years. By then, the 41-year-old executive predicts, the company, which is Fortune 500 in size, could go public.  Ms. Wachner\\'s marketing and turnaround expertise should serve her well. As vice president of Warnaco\\'s Warner bras unit 12 years ago, she revolutionized that business by developing wireless bras and displaying them not in the customary boxes but simply on hangers. Later, as president of Beatrice Cos.\\' Max Factor cosmetics business, she nursed the faltering unit back to health, launching Le Jardin, Factor\\'s first successful new perfume in years.  At Warnaco, where she puts in 14-hour days, Ms. Wachner has installed new managers and designers, and cut overhead by consolidating divisions. She shops in at least one department store each day \"to see what the competition is selling,\" often dragging Warnaco executives with her.  When she isn\\'t visiting Warnaco plants or Paris fashion shows, Ms. Wachner, a widow, shuttles between apartments in Los Angeles and New York. She doesn\\'t mind being called \"tough\" and \"driven\" by some subordinates, she says, \"as long as that means driven for a reason.  \"To make it to the top,\" she says, \"you\\'ve got to want it with all your heart.\"  --- Ms. Hymowitz is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal\\'s Pittsburgh bureau.

       " 'WSJ870320-0142': 'Proposes Possible Takeover Defenses --- By J. Ernest Beazley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AmeriTrust Corp., facing the prospect of a takeover, may be moving to erect some defenses.  The Cleveland-based regional bank holding company, Ohio\\'s third-largest, said it plans to split its stock 2-for-1, raise its dividend and more than double the number of authorized but unissued shares. In addition, AmeriTrust said it intends to stagger the terms of its directors.  Analysts said the steps -- though not unusual for a regional banking concern - indicate that AmeriTrust is readying defenses against an investor group that has bought a 9.6% stake in it.  Jerry V. Jarrett, chairman and chief executive officer, said he will ask directors to boost to 50 cents a share from 44 cents, on a pre-split basis, the quarterly payout on common stock. Analysts said the proposed increase is larger than they expected.  AmeriTrust said it will propose to shareholders at its annual meeting May 14 the stock split and staggered terms for its 25-member board. The split would double the number of shares outstanding to 41.8 million.  In addition, the banking concern said it will ask holders to approve an increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares to 100 million -- more than double the number of shares outstanding after allowing for the split.  As previously reported, a group led by Alfred Lerner, a banking and real estate executive with holdings in Baltimore and Cleveland, disclosed this week that it had acquired a 9.6% stake in AmeriTrust. Mr. Lerner, who wouldn\\'t say whether the group plans a takeover bid, has asked the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for permission to buy as much as 24.9% of AmeriTrust stock.  An Ameritrust spokesman said the additional authorized shares may be used for a \"variety of reasons\" not connected to defending the company from a takeover, including acquisitions. The banking concern added that it still has no indication that Mr. Lerner\\'s interest is hostile.  Frank Barkocy, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, said AmeriTrust is likely to resist a takeover. \"They feel they are developing critical mass and can choose their own partner,\" he said. He added that, given uncertainty over the Lerner group\\'s motives, AmeriTrust appears to be \"getting prepared for contingencies.\"  Jeffrey L. Cohn, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst, termed AmeriTrust\\'s actions \"pretty mild\" defensive measures that won\\'t hamper any potential acquirer. \"Even with a staggered board, AmeriTrust is amazingly free of shark repellent,\" he said.

Tokyo stocks also fell.  London shares declined from trading\\'s start in the wake of Wednesday\\'s announcement by the government. The 100-share index, which edged up 0.3 point Wednesday, closed down 15.6 points, at 1991. The Financial Times industrial-share index fell 7.9 to 1581.6.  The government said the sale would be \"subject to market conditions.\" It is presumed that the sale is contingent on the ruling Conservative Party winning the next election. A national vote must be held before June 1988 but is expected sometime this year.  The government will move \"probably sooner rather than later\" to sell the BP stake, worth the equivalent of $7.57 billion at yesterday\\'s close, because of the recent strength in oil prices, a dealer said.  At that value, the sale would be the largest of the government\\'s privatization efforts this year and would put a substantial demand on the market\\'s financial resources, dealers said.  Still, it would only temporarily deter the market\\'s upward trend, they said. \"I don\\'t think the bull market is over by any means,\" one said.  The 100-share index opened down 17.5 points. It struggled higher and was down only 6.0 shortly before noon. But it couldn\\'t sustain even that level during the slack period around midday.  The BP news has been \"used as an excuse by the market-makers to put the market a little bit lower,\" a dealer at County Securities said. \"It\\'s more marking-down of stocks by the market-makers than actual business being done.\"  \"The market-makers were looking for levels at which they could do some business,\" a trader observed.  Also, investors probably wanted a few more days of reflection to get a clearer idea of the budget\\'s impact and where British interest rates are headed, a dealer said.  Cadbury Schweppes was one issue that rose. There were rumors that General Cinema Corp. had sold its 8.3% stake in Cadbury to RJR Nabisco Inc.  After the close of trading in London, a General Cinema spokesman said the company doesn\\'t comment on rumors. Meanwhile, a source close to the company said the rumors weren\\'t true.  The gold mines index rose 6.1 points to 350.4.  Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks slipped in heavy trading as buying from institutional investors eased in the face of upcoming settlement and valuation dates.  The Nikkei stock average, which surged 190.33 points Wednesday, fell 60.74 points to 21,644.32 after two consecutive days of record closes.  The stock exchange index, which rose 17.05 Wednesday, fell 16.49 to 1858.31 yesterday. Volume was about 1.4 billion shares, down from a record 2.4 billion Wednesday.  The fiscal year valuation today for tokkin funds as well as half-year settlements for several large securities firms sparked widespread selling after a bullish start, traders said. Tokkin funds are similar to U.S. mutual funds. Institutions preparing for book closings also limited their buying, contributing to the drop in trading.  The easing turnover sidelined other investors worried about a possible correction in the Nikkei average following recent surges, traders said. In the 15 sessions before yesterday\\'s, the average successively posted record-closing streaks of five days, four days and two days.

This type of talk shouldn\\'t frighten me, except that tonight I, too, am a narcotics agent. And now I am supposed to walk outside to a parked car -- my first \"solo\" -- and buy a half-gram of cocaine.  It is the \"final exam\" at a class run by Professional Law Enforcement Inc., a detective agency that does drug-surveillance work for small towns, high schools and some major corporations. Agents of PLE, a unit of privately held Massey Burch Investment Group Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., in recent months were behind more than 200 drug and other arrests at several General Motors Corp. plants and 137 arrests at or near a Whirlpool Corp. facility in Arkansas. PLE let this reporter attend a two-week training course for prospective agents, at the end of which, if possible, each trainee is to make a drug buy as part of a sheriff\\'s-department undercover operation.  Things go wrong as soon as we reach the car. \"Do a snort,\" urges the dealer, drawing from his jacket a thimble-sized vial filled with white powder. \"It\\'s what you\\'ll be buying.\"  I had practiced faking cocaine use in a hotel mirror for days in anticipation of this moment. But my hands tremble as I fumble with the vial and a coke spoon disguised as a key. Recalling a tip, I bob my head in the seat as I draw the spoon to my nose, feigning fear of being seen by passing police. With the dealer\\'s gaze momentarily diverted, I sniff, a bit too violently, while secretly sliding the white powder off onto my left thumb. Quickly I wipe my thumb on my pants while running the spoon over my gums.  \"You seem a little bit too much in a hurry,\" the dealer says. \"That makes me nervous. I don\\'t even think you snorted that. Mind if I see some ID?\" Foolishly, I produce my wallet, flashing my driver\\'s license and my library card.  But I balk when he suggests we snort a \"line,\" a procedure that is very hard to fake. \"Are we going to do the deal or not?\" I ask, not needing to fake my fear and anger. \"Let\\'s just go back inside.\"  Inside, we walk to a bathroom to complete the buy. Here the deal is nearly blown again: Not only am I forced to run outside to break a $20 bill, but also I hand over the $50 before being given the vial, a cardinal sin for a narc. Still, I manage to do the deal.  My elation at that, however, vanishes an hour later. I learn that the deal was phony: The \"coke\" isn\\'t coke, and the \"dealer\" is a PLE man. He is Gary Smith, a detective who later permits me to accompany him during part of an undercover drug investigation in Mason, Ohio.  The instructors explain that a trainee needs to be observed doing what he believes is a real drug deal. PLE\\'s training, while not nearly as rigorous as the monthslong courses given federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents, is considered superior to that of many small agencies that only dabble in undercover work.  It is supervised by the portly Mr. Probst and another agent, Harry Sweigart. Mr. Probst, like a tourist checking his wallet, frequently flicks his hand to the pistol at his belt. He has reason to be jumpy: He has recently busted eight members of a motorcycle gang after living with two of them for months; he hears they have put a price on his head.  In the class besides me are two detectives and an 18-year-old woman targeted for undercover work in high schools. Most recruits are police officers, and the first step is to \"de-cop\" them. Shed immediately are black leather belts and black oxfords. The class is told to avoid jargon like \"perpetrator.\" Even posture may be changed. \"Don\\'t walk with one arm swinging,\" one new agent is told. \"It\\'s a cop walk.\"  Trainees, between learning to identify drugs and practicing buys before a video camera, hear lectures on topics ranging from how to discourage being frisked while wearing a tape recorder (\"You gay?\" sometimes works) to the quickest way to test the purity of cocaine (coke rubbed between the fingers for a minute will disappear, leaving behind the \"cut,\" any kind of powder used to dilute it). Tips range from the useful (\"stay away from cellular phones; neighbors can listen in\") to the obvious (\"fistfights don\\'t look good; plus, you may get whipped\").  A seminar on pretending to use cocaine is a near-fiasco. Scott, a beefy police reservist from Michigan, repeatedly tips a cocaine spoon, showering rivulets of Sweet \\'N Low down his shirt-front. Instructors warn me against my habit of dusting the \"cocaine\" off the table top. \"Do that for real and you\\'ll have eight guys sniffing at your feet,\" one says.  The toughest task for some new agents, officers who may scorn drug users, is simply asking to buy drugs. \"Some cops just can\\'t do it,\" says Mr. Probst with a shrug. The approach should be indirect and nonthreatening. Not \"I hear you have some coke,\" but \"Know anybody who has some coke?\"  And always haggle. \"Most cops will buy anything at any price,\" says Mr. Sweigart. \"Do that and you\\'re made {exposed}. Talk \\'em down. You\\'ll look better to the dopers, and the city or company will love you for saving them money.\"  To acquire the tools of their trade, such as copies of High Times magazine to scatter around their home, new operatives visit a \"head shop\" filled with hundreds of carved and metal pipes, colorful glass \"bongs\" for pot-smoking, and drug stashes in the form of soft-drink and tennis-ball cans with screw tops. Don, a tough-talking homicide detective from Akron, Ohio, squats before a glass case and chooses two coke spoons and a kit for cutting cocaine. \"Jeez,\" he whispers, \"it\\'s so funny standing here. I used to bust guys carrying this stuff and think, \\'You dirtball.\\'\"  Not all excursions go smoothly. One night Mr. Probst, who sometimes feels compelled to revisit the scenes of his buys, tows us into the darkened streets of a rundown area in West Dayton to the clubhouse of a motorcycle gang. A blue Gremlin pulls behind us as we drive by. Circling to pass again, we meet the car at an intersection. A bearded face reminiscent of killer Charles Manson peers into our car, craning at us as we go by. \"Oh man, I busted that guy,\" Mr. Probst says. \"Hurry up.\" Five quick turns later we leave the neighborhood.  \"What a rush,\" Don says from the back seat.  \"Really,\" Mr. Probst says, staring ahead, touching his gun.  Undercover agents spend a lot of time looking for drugs, but sometimes the drugs find them first. One evening a group of narcs and narc trainees gathers at a striptease bar for drinks and debriefing. Talk of \"coke\" and \"buys\" apparently attracts attention. Before long, a scantily clad dancer cozies up in a chair next to me.  \"You like coke?\" she coos. I nod, and negotiations begin. \"My dealer comes in at two. Fifty dollars a half-gram. It\\'s got crystals. It\\'s just up from Florida. You\\'ll love it.\"  A few detectives favor buying the drugs, but to do so would violate the rule against making a buy without clear authority from local law-enforcement officials. Besides, we\\'ve had plenty to drink. After somebody mutters, \"Honey, we\\'re cops,\" the group quickly walks out of the dimly lit club, leaving the would-be dealer gaping.

       " 'WSJ870320-0139': '--- Discovery Prompts Frantic Research Effort; U.S. Response Is Measured --- By Stephen Kreider Yoder Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> In the corner of Prof. Shinichi Uchida\\'s laboratory at the University of Tokyo, across from the bottles of liquid nitrogen, stands a bunk bed.  Until recently it was little used. Then, on Feb. 15, a University of Houston press conference announced the latest breakthrough in the science of superconductivity, a development with potentially enormous commercial applications.  The lab and its bunks here seldom have been empty since.  For three weeks Prof. Uchida\\'s 12-researcher team worked around the clock, seven days a week to duplicate the Houston results. Sleeping in shifts, they cooked their meals in a tiny kitchenette while their latest batch of experimental ceramic pellets baked in the lab\\'s kiln.  In other labs, in company board rooms and in the offices of the powerful Ministry of Trade and Industry, or MITI, the Houston breakthrough has galvanized Japan. Scientists, industrialists and government officials have responded frantically, convinced they can, and must, walk away with the commercial applications. \"When it comes time to make something out of it,\" predicts Prof. Shoji Tanaka, who is Prof. Uchida\\'s boss, \"the Japanese will have the upper hand.\"  In the U.S., by contrast, the reaction has been more measured. Labs are busy, but there isn\\'t any nationally coordinated drive for commercialization. Leaders in superconductivity research caution that much science remains to be done first. \"You must keep in mind that the scientific scene is changing so rapidly that to decide (on specific applications) on the basis of what is known today would be a mistake,\" says John Armstrong, director of the research division at International Business Machines Corp. It would also be wrong, he thinks, \"to turn this into a race between East and West.\"  Here in Tokyo, however, the race is already on, showing once again the competitive drive and speed with which Japan can seize on Western science.  New materials that conduct electricity at warmer temperatures with almost no loss of power, have \"opened a fantastic world of future industries,\" says Masatoshi Urashima, a MITI official. Because previous superconductors operated only at extremely low and expensive-to-maintain temperatures, the new materials make economical the creation of tiny, superfast computers, magnetically floating trains, long-distance power lines that don\\'t waste electricity and even appliances that use almost no power.  The discovery meshes with technologies Japan has refined for years. Japan has a train using superconductivity that is almost ready for commercial use. It travels at more than 250 miles an hour while hovering five inches above a track on a magnetic cushion created by superconducting coils. Japan\\'s shipbuilders, meanwhile, have spent $23 million to build a fast ship propelled by superconducting magnets.  NEC Corp. and others already have produced prototypes of superconducting computer chips; the West gave up trying to do so four years ago. Such giant electronics concerns as Hitachi Ltd. are supplying the West with millions of dollars of superconducting equipment. And Japan\\'s leading role in industrial ceramics will help it develop ceramic superconductors. \"A lot of revolutionary things are going to come up and a lot of it is going to come from Japan,\" says David L. Keller, a technology analyst with James Capel &amp; Co., a British securities firm. \"The Japanese will dramatically lead the rest of the world.\"  The Japanese government already is organizing that. Four days after the Houston bombshell, Japan\\'s Science and Technology Agency announced its intent to form a research consortium of Japanese companies, universities and government labs. A week later, the consortium was in place, including such industrial giants as NEC, Toshiba Corp., Nippon Steel Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. \"We\\'ve gathered all the leading-edge researchers in superconductivity in Japan,\" says Koji Yamaguchi, the agency official overseeing research. \"We need to get everybody together to share information and decide how to move.\"  MITI, the agency that picks and funds national projects like the one that helped Japanese makers dominate the memory chip business, began moving on the day of the announcement. It already is polishing up an existing feasibility study on a superconducting power plant and plans to have a working model built by 1992.  \"The objective is to organize industry to get the jump on the West in applications and commercialization for a huge new market,\" says Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan\\'s leading business daily. The earliest application, researchers say, could be superconducting computer chips that would enable creation of a shoe box-sized supercomputer. IBM and most other U.S. companies abandoned research in 1983 on the chips, called Josephson Junction devices, partly because of the complications of cooling with helium. That left NEC, Hitachi and a MITI lab to refine the technology with little foreign competition.  For all the government-inspired organization, Japan\\'s research labs didn\\'t wait for government orders when they heard the news from Houston last month.  At the University of Tokyo, Mr. Uchida sat his researchers down in front of a large periodic table of the elements. For hours they debated which elements Houston could possibly have used. While they were still guessing, a rumor came over the phone that the material was fluoric. Students ran out and bought fluorinated chemicals. For three days they tried out hundreds of combinations until they found the rumor was false.  Acting on another tip that the Houston material was dark green, the researchers mixed all the plausible chemicals that would become green when fired, again with no success. (The material needs to be fired further until it is black, they found later.) Then a news report said a Chinese lab had achieved superconductivity at 100 degrees Kelvin (minus 173 degrees Celsius) using a ceramic with ytterbium in it and researchers attacked that. The report proved wrong -- the element was yttrium. (Ironically, the University of Tokyo lab later found, by coincidence, that ytterbium works. The lab patented the discovery.)  Finally at 2 a.m. March 1, they got superconductivity. \"It was an other-worldly experience,\" says Prof. Uchida. They drank a toast and launched back into another week of experiments, this time to refine the resulting ceramic. On March 8 they announced a purified form. On Wednesday the lab finally took a holiday.  Meanwhile, labs at Tohoko University, Hokkaido University and a government research facility in Tokyo have burst forth with rapid-fire announcements of their advances in superconductivity. They and other labs have been snatching up the ingredients for superconductors so fast that there are shortages. Suppliers have run out of yttrium, for example, and labs must wait three weeks for orders to be filled.  Prof. Uchida\\'s lab has been flooded by calls and visits from companies. Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. researchers brought in some rudimentary wire made from superconducting ceramic. Engineers from Toshiba, Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi have visited the lab to keep watch on developments.\"Company people have the conviction that ths s finally the real thing. A lot are starting to pick it up. . . . They see tha superconductivity is a sure thing and the want to get on to application,\" says rof. Uchida. \"Everybody\\'s going to be doing it -- steelmakers, cemical companies, computer makers, cement makers. They\\'ll all be getting in to apply this,\" he says.  Of course, there is scientific and commercial excitement in the U.S., too, but it\\'s less frenetic and isn\\'t centrally controlled. Scientists say indications of an incipient breakthrough came as early as April 1986, when researchers at IBM\\'s laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, reported they had achieved superconductivity in a new class of materials, the metal oxide ceramics. This galvanized researchers throughout the world. By November, the Japanese and Chinese had confirmed the IBM discovery and by December, scientists in Houston and at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.\\'s Bell Laboratories were reporting important advances with the new materials.  About 5,000 physicists jammed the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in New York Wednesday night for an unprecedented special session on superconductors at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society. They listened to the presentation of 60 papers on superconductivity research done largely within the last two to three months. Although scientists from U.S. universities dominated the program, there were reports from IBM, Bell Labs, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Exxon Corp. as well as from Japanese, Chinese and Canadian scientists.  The breakthrough generated tremendous excitement among Bell Labs scientists, says Robert A. Laudise, director of the laboratories\\' inorganic chemistry branch. \"Usually, research managers are coaching people to do this or that,\" Mr. Laudise notes. \"But in this case we had people coming around from all different disciplines wanting to know if there was anything in this for their area,\" he says.  \"We\\'ve had a lot of people going without sleep,\" Mr. Laudise says. But he agrees with IBM\\'s Mr. Armstrong that it\\'s still too soon for anyone to settle on specific applications of the superconductors. \"We\\'re not trying to make any specific devices or systems,\" he says.  Bell Labs researchers are, however, trying to fabricate various superconducting materials into experimental devices. At Wednesday\\'s APS meeting they displayed a superconductor in the form of a flexible ceramic tape that can be formed and then hardened into a shape to fit a superconducting device. \"When you try to make things, it challenges your understanding of the materials,\" explains Mr. Laudise. While \"it is mainly a scientific race . . . we\\'re well aware of the competitive aspects\" of the research, he says. Patent applications are filed as rapidly as possible and scientists don\\'t always disclose all their findings in open scientific meetings, he notes.  Researchers at General Electric Co.\\'s big research and development center in Schnectady, N.Y., agree that it\\'s too soon to jump into an industrial competition with anyone, including the Japanese.  \"In the materials field, the events of the last several weeks have been quite spectacular, but in the applications sense, the jury is still very much out,\" says Michael Jefferies, manager in the center\\'s engineering physics laboratory.  Until recently, the GE lab didn\\'t have a group of scientists working on superconducting materials. \"But we\\'re now trying to confirm and duplicate the results that are being reported,\" Mr. Jefferies says.  Guy Donaruma, vice president for research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says governmental agencies and private concerns have shown a keen interest in the university\\'s superconductivity research, which duplicated the Houston breakthrough.  \"Wherever I go around town somebody buttonholes me and asks how we\\'re coming along or when can we use this,\" Mr. Donaruma says. Some inquiries have come from the space and defense related agencies in the area, including the Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Missile Command, he says. Some Southern utilities also have made inquiries regarding possible uses applicable to more efficient means of transmitting power, he adds.  In Palo Alto, Calif., where Stanford University recently announced a breakthrough in fabricating a superconducting thin film, useful in electronic devices, a news conference last week was packed with industry people. Several other scientists have called for more information for use in making a superpowerful magnet used by geological researchers. Niels Reimers, director of Stanford\\'s technology licensing office, said, however, that he hasn\\'t been fielding many industry inquiries.  In Japan, however, companies that already sell conventional superconducting wire to the U.S. have begun crash programs to commercialize the new discovery. Fujikura Ltd. and Sumitomo Electric, for example, say they have developed rudimentary wire out of the new ceramic, despite skepticism among some scientists that the material won\\'t lend itself to wiremaking. \"As makers, we\\'ve got to pick it up,\" says a Sumitomo spokesman. \"And we\\'re moving on it.\"  Like their U.S. counterparts, Japanese makers temper their euphoria with warnings that too little is known about the new ceramic superconductor to tell when and how the material will be commercialized.  Aside from possible problems in forming brittle ceramic into wire, the new superconductor still can\\'t handle enough current to be used in heavy applications such as power plants. Superconductors also don\\'t work well with alternating current, the type of electricity used in most of the world\\'s power equipment.  But Japanese labs are convinced they can solve the problems over the next several years. Now that the West has made the basic breakthrough, they say, the ball is in their court. \"It will be difficult and will take time,\" says Kasumasa Togano, a government scientist. \"But that\\'s precisely where Japan\\'s labs and makers have the edge.\"  Still, he and other researchers admit to a twinge of hurt pride. \"To be honest, we\\'re following in the footsteps of the U.S.,\" Mr. Togano says. \"Here, again, the originality is coming from the West. We have a measure of sadness about that.\"  --- Jerry E. Bishop in New York contributed to this article. ',\n",

Almost one-third of the 351 respondents to a Wall Street Journal survey on executive style said they have never worked for a company other than the one they now lead. And 43% of them were with their company for more than 16 years before becoming CEO.  The survey -- which targeted the CEOs of the Fortune 500 industrial companies and 350 of the Fortune 500 service companies -- found that in their personal lives as well as their business careers, these men go against the grain of the evanescent 1980s.  In a time when it seems that all sorts of things from automobiles to relationships don\\'t last as long as they used to, more than 80% of the CEOs have been married only once, and roughly the same percentage have been married longer than 20 years. Just over a third have four or more children -- a plurality over those who have two or three. (A tiny 4% have only one child, and 2% have none.)  All of the survey respondents were male; so few women lead large U.S. corporations that many survey questions were written with a male respondent in mind, angering some women who read them. Not only has the women\\'s movement not put women at the top of the nation\\'s largest corporations, it also hasn\\'t had much impact on chief executives\\' spouses. More than 90% of respondents\\' spouses in the survey don\\'t work outside the home.  The fathers of today\\'s CEOs had a wide range of careers -- policemen, doctors, lawyers, journalists, engineers. But more had business executives for fathers than anything else.  They come from all regions of the U.S., but none of the respondents grew up in Maine, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska or Hawaii. New York produced 15% of the chief executives, the highest single-state total. Just under 3% of them grew up abroad.  Their personal habits wouldn\\'t surprise a Rip Van Winkle waking up after snoozing through the upheavals of the \\'60s and \\'70s -- except, perhaps, for the lack of cigarette smoke in the executive suite. Only 7% smoke cigarettes.  But they like to have a drink. Only 8% are teetotalers. For the rest, the most popular drinks are wine and Scotch. A martini is the drink of choice for only 7%.  These clearly are affluent men. They like expensive cars, and for all their Main Street traits, almost half of them are deserting Detroit for foreign car makes. Overwhelmingly, the first cars they ever bought were Fords and Chevys. But now, only half of them prefer U.S.-built autos. On their wrists, you\\'re most likely to find a Seiko watch.  When they buy the blue suits, white shirts and red ties they favor, they\\'re most likely to get them at Brooks Brothers. Still, a quarter of them have suits and shirts custom made, and a good sprinkling favor tailors in London or Hong Kong. Another sprinkling have stuck to less glamorous haberdasheries such as Wallach\\'s.  But a few break away from the pattern of their peers to indulge an offbeat hobby. There\\'s a bagpiper and a couple of banjo players. Two men list curling among their favorite sports. A handful relax by cooking. Two raise orchids, and one carves duck decoys.  --- City Life If you could live in any city, where would it be?  1. San Francisco 2. (tie) London  New York 4.

       " 'WSJ870320-0137': 'For Computer Whiz Kid --- By Brenton R. Schlender Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> William Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., became the personal computer industry\\'s first billion-dollar man yesterday.  The 31-year-old Harvard University dropout holds 11,018,955 shares, or about a 42% stake in Microsoft, which supplies, among other things, the internal program that controls the basic functions of International Business Machines Inc.\\'s PC line of personal computers and compatible machines.  The magic number for the billion-dollar mark for Mr. Gates\\'s stake was a share price of $90.75, and the stock rose above and dipped below that level during the day. Microsoft finally closed at $91.25, up $1.75, in national over-the-counter trading, which brought the value of his stake to $1,005,479,643.75.  Mr. Gates, who was traveling in South America, wasn\\'t available for comment on his new distinction. In recent months, colleagues and competitors had begun to jokingly refer to Mr. Gates as \"Billion Dollar Bill\" as the paper value of his fortune swelled.  Mr. Gates is the biggest beneficiary of an astonishing run-up in the price of Microsoft shares. The shares, which first were offered to the public a little more than a year ago for $21 each, have been outpacing the booming stock markets in recent months, and have nearly doubled in value since the end of the year.  \"Is there a premium in the stock price because of Bill Gates?\" asked Richard Sherlund, an analyst who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. \"I\\'d have to say yes, because he is considered one of the brightest people in the industry.\" Mr. Sherlund also said Microsoft\\'s role \"at the focal point of the personal computer industry\" -- supplying operating system software to both IBM and other manufacturers -- has driven market enthusiasm for the stock.  Not even the founders of Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, came close to building billion-dollar fortunes in personal computers, even though they practically fathered that industry.  In high-technology businesses, only H. Ross Perot, who founded Electronic Data Systems Corp., now the data-processing services division of General Motors Corp., and David Packard and William Hewlett, founders of computer and scientific instrument maker Hewlett-Packard Co., have the distinction of building personal fortunes estimated to exceed $1 billion.

       " 'WSJ870320-0135': '$88 Billion Bill For U.S. Highways --- By Laurie McGinley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> Despite a veto threat from President Reagan, the Senate passed an $88 billion highway bill, but it postponed action on a separate measure to allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles an hour on most rural interstate highways.  The 79-17 Senate vote on the House-Senate conference report came a day after the House approved the legislation by an overwhelming 407-17. Both votes indicate Congress could override a presidential veto. The House voted separately 217-206 to permit states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on most rural interstate highways.  The president, in his veto message to Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), expressed \"grave concerns\" about the cost of the legislation -- particularly for more than 150 special highway construction projects and for mass transit programs.  Mr. Reagan said that over the five-year life of the bill, the mass-transit funding would exceed his budget request by $9.1 billion. While he noted that he \"strongly\" supported allowing states to raise the speed limit, he said that \"overall, the measure is seriously flawed.\"  To eliminate Mr. Reagan\\'s objections to the bill, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said an amendment would be offered to the speed-limit provision when it comes up on the floor, probably today. The amendment, he said, may be the four-year, $65 billion highway bill that the Senate passed earlier this year.  Although that bill greatly exceeded the administration\\'s budget request for mass transit, it didn\\'t contain any extra funding for special highway projects. The House-Senate conference report contains about $890 million in new federal funding for these projects; the money would be in addition to the states\\' regular shares of federal highway aid.  By using the speed-limit provision to amend the highway conference report, Sen. Dole would circumvent the procedural ban on amendments to conference reports and appease the administration. But the action, if successful, also could jeopardize the highway legislation because the House, which has fought fiercely for the special highway projects, would have to approve the changes.  \"The bill as is, and only the bill as is, can be passed by the Congress,\" said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.), floor manager for the bill.  Administration insiders concede Sen. Dole\\'s effort to change the highway bill by amending the speed-limit provision is a long shot. That\\'s partly because senators from the West who are sympathetic to cost concerns about the highway bill don\\'t want to jeopardize the speed-limit measure by changing it.  But even if Sen. Dole\\'s gambit fails, these officials said, the exercise could help sustain a presidential veto of the highway bill later. The reasoning is that the Senate would be more likely to vote to sustain a veto if it were clear that the president supported the original, Senate-passed highway bill.  That bill would authorize about $53 billion for highways and $13 billion for mass transit over a four-year period. The House-Senate conference report would authorize about $70 billion for highways and $18 billion for transit over five years. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0134': 'It Will Increase Bid for Chemlawn --- By Michael J. McCarthy Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN> Waste Management Inc., which had said it wouldn\\'t sweeten its $27-a-share bid for ChemLawn Corp. and had insisted the offer was \"fair and fully priced,\" said it is ready to boost the bid to $33 a share.  But Wall Street didn\\'t seem satisfied as traders drove ChemLawn\\'s stock price above the proposed bid. Such activity usually indicates that the market expects a higher bid or a new suitor.  ChemLawn declined to comment, but a spokesman said the company was likely to respond to the offer today. The Columbus, Ohio-based lawn-care concern has been seeking other purchasers since earlier this month, when it rejected Waste Management\\'s $27-a-share bid as \"inadequate.\" Waste Management announced that surprise tender offer in late February.  Under the new plan, the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste hauler said it would pay $33 for each of ChemLawn\\'s about 10 million shares, or about $330 million, if ChemLawn promptly agrees to be acquired at that price.  In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, ChemLawn common shares closed at $34.125, up $2.25. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Waste Management closed at $76.375, up $1.50.  A Waste Management spokesman declined to say why the company did an about-face and raised the bid.  \"Waste Management probably initially thought $27 was high enough that it would be a pre-emptive bid,\" said Clarke Walser, an analyst with Chicago Corp. In mid-February, immediately before Waste Management\\'s offer, ChemLawn shares were trading between $16 and $18. But the stock instantly jumped above Waste Management\\'s $27-a-share offer to $29.625 bid. It has gradually risen since. Waste Management may have been worried by ChemLawn\\'s announcement in mid-March that it was in talks with various parties on the possible sale of the company, Mr. Walser said.  Acquiring ChemLawn would expand Waste Management\\'s residential-services business from trash collection into lawn spraying. Analysts have said that Waste Management has been looking for acquisitions in the outdoor-services industry, and the company is well-armed financially to pursue them. The Waste Management spokesman said the company would pay for ChemLawn with cash and short-term debt. He declined to elaborate. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0132': '--- By Felix G. Rohatyn</HL> We have witnessed startling events in U.S. foreign policy during the past year. The Reykjavik summit produced what appeared to be a total repudiation of America\\'s basic security posture by proposing the total abolition of ballistic missiles by 1996. The Iran-contra affair repudiated America\\'s basic position of not dealing with terrorist governments and not paying ransom for hostages.  These abrupt foreign-policy shifts followed less noticed but equally abrupt shifts in economic policy. From 1980 to 1984, the U.S. followed a deliberate policy of driving up the value of the dollar and interpreting its 50% rise as a reflection of American strength; in 1985, the U.S. shifted gears and proceeded to drive the dollar down at least as much in order to regain American competitiveness. To resolve the Third World debt problem, it supported an austerity policy sponsored by the International Monetary Fund from 1980 to 1984, and then switched to a growth-oriented policy in 1985.  Consistency, in and of itself, is not necessarily a virtue. But when the world\\'s leading economic and military power shifts gears as brutally and dramatically as the U.S. has done in areas vital to its allies as well as its adversaries, the result is an inevitable loss of America\\'s ability to provide leadership. To this we must add the dynamics created by a presidential election in 1988.  There is no purely American solution to any of our major economic problems. The U.S. cannot afford a recession that would drive its deficits to more than $300 billion and possibly cause a crash in the value of the dollar as well as in the stock and bond markets. The result could be massive domestic and international banking defaults, a world recession and political instability in large parts of the globe. Avoiding such a catastrophe will involve a delicate combination of coordinated domestic and international efforts:  --The U.S. must cut its budget deficit with new taxes and reductions in expenditures.  --To counteract the risk of recession, it must reduce interest rates and run an easier monetary policy.  --To avoid a collapse of the dollar, Japan and Europe will have to stimulate growth, cut taxes and interest rates.  --And to promote growth in the Third World, the U.S., Japan and Western Europe will have to agree on an aggressive plan of debt restructuring and new capital for the debtor countries.  It is hard to see how any of this could happen in a traditional U.S. presidential election year. Under normal circumstances, even if the next president were willing to embrace such an agenda it probably would not see the light of day until 1990. That may well be too late.  In the foreign-policy field, events are similarly crowding the U.S. Developments in the Soviet Union suggest a desire on the part of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev for a massive effort to modernize the Soviet economy, which can happen only with the West\\'s cooperation. For the first time since World War II, it is possible that arms-control negotiations, tied to economic and trade negotiations, could change the internal dynamics of the Soviet Union and, possibly, the overall relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The volatile stituation in the Middle East requires firm and steady leadership from the U.S. together with Europe, both for international security reasons and for America\\'s coming dependence on Mideastern oil.  How is all this affected by next year\\'s presidential election? Politicians have a tendency to re-create the last election just as generals have a tendency to fight the last war. By that wisdom, on the domestic front, the Democratic presidential candidates will refuse to discuss any increase in taxes and the Republican candidates will duck the issue of possible cutbacks in Social Security and other entitlements. That will clearly doom any serious action on the budget deficit until 1990.  On the international front, neither Democrats nor Republicans will want to deal with Third World debt restructuring while the farm sector, the energy sector and other parts of the U.S. economy are in difficulty. As for American ties with the Soviets, Republicans will outdo each other as to hawkishness and Democrats will fear to be perceived as \"soft on communism.\"  The presidential candidates in 1988 will have to decide whether to be realistic and truthful about what the U.S. is facing, thereby running the risk of political suicide. Or, they will have to make promises they cannot possibly keep and, therefore, be unable to govern if elected.  One way to avoid these alternatives would be to try to create a consensus among moderate Republican and Democratic leaders on certain aspects of an agenda for the next president. This could be done by establishing a bipartisan congressional commission modeled on the Temporary National Economic Commission set up by Franklin Roosevelt in 1938 to study the country\\'s economic problems.  The commission could consist of, say, four members of Congress, four businessmen and four academicians. They would be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and would represent ideologically moderate wings of their parties. Their task would be to identify the main issues and to establish the next president\\'s priorities. Even if the commission did not reach a consensus on how to solve the major economic problems, it could lay out options that could influence the campaign debate.  With respect to the deficit, the alternatives of higher income taxes or new types of consumption taxes would leave a great deal of room for argument -- as would mechanisms to make certain that new taxes do not translate into new spending. When it comes to trade, the options would probably include a further lowering of the dollar, temporary tariffs, or some forms of limited industrial policies. As for interest rates and the Federal Reserve, the commission could debate monetary policy and, one would hope, come up with an unanimous recommendation to continue Paul Volcker for another term.  With respect to entitlements, the alternative of means testings or taxing affluent recipients should be examined. And as for Third World debt, the options could include government involvement as part of a major restructuring program of the type recommended by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) or the continuation of rollovers together with some version of the current Baker Plan.  While a commission would provide a reasonable framework for debate of the economic alternatives and allow the candidates to present their vision of America within such a framework, it would also provide the domestic framework within which Americans could debate the critical foreign-policy issue of the 1988 campaign -- namely, America\\'s long-term relationship with the Soviet Union.  In the final analysis, the next president will be elected on the voters\\' belief in his character and his competence. If the country wishes to elect a radical of the right or of the left, so be it. But if the country wishes to elect a moderate, at least let us provide him with some of the tools to do the job: a realistic program for his election and bipartisan support for his governance.  --- Mr. Rohatyn is a senior partner in Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and chairman of New York\\'s Municipal Assistance Corp.

The complex bank financing agreement, which is expected to be filed today in bankruptcy court in New York, had drawn objections from LTV\\'s unsecured creditors and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures corporate pensions, because it tinkered with some aspects of LTV\\'s cash management procedures while leaving others alone.  The big steel, aerospace and energy concern has been operating since last July with protection from creditors\\' lawsuits, under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while it works out a plan to pay debt. Since the financing package was first filed with the court last December, bankers, creditors and LTV officials have spent hundreds of hours at the bargaining table reworking the cash management procedures.  As part of the initial agreement between LTV and the 22-member bank group, the company had agreed to restrict the profits it would funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy products units. In the first year, LTV could transfer $77 million from the aerospace and defense unit to the parent company, plus 50% of the unit\\'s profits in future years.  That aspect of the accord wasn\\'t changed, the banks and creditors said. Most of the changes involved reporting mechanisms, whereby LTV has agreed to provide detailed information to its creditors about many of its cash transfers, they said. LTV declined to comment until the agreement is filed with the bankruptcy court.  With the revisions, a creditors\\' spokesman said, \"If any movement is made that we feel impairs the ability of the unsecured creditors to protect their interests, we\\'ll have enough notice to go into court.\"  The pension agency, which has taken over LTV\\'s four big steel pension funds, also had been concerned that the banks\\' agreement to repackage about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit constituted a reorganization plan of sorts. Attorneys representing LTV\\'s banks said language in the agreement was changed and clarified to make it clear that the debts were still considered to be so-called pre-petition claims, which can\\'t be paid outside of a formal reorganization plan.  LTV\\'s Chapter 11 filing cited huge interest and pension costs, and continuing problems at its beleaguered steel unit, the nation\\'s second-largest. The company plans to reorganize around its aerospace and defense unit.  LTV had urged quick approval of the agreement in January, saying it needed the new $100 million in financing for letters of credit to support foreign sales of military and drilling equipment. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0127': 'Settles SEC Market Manipulation Charge --- He Aids U.S. Investigation Of American Express Offering, Sources Say --- By James B. Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> Boyd L. Jefferies, chairman of Jefferies Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm that pioneered off-market trading and became a major force in takeovers, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities law violations.  And, according to people familiar with the government\\'s investigation, Mr. Jefferies also has implicated others in the securities industry\\'s rapidly widening scandal, including individuals believed to have manipulated the price of an offering by American Express Co. of Fireman\\'s Fund Corp. securities last year.  Mr. Jefferies also settled, without admitting guilt, related charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he engaged in multiple violations of securities laws as a participant in a market manipulation scheme, and in a separate scheme with takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky to \"park\" stock.  Parking stock occurs when an investor buys stock for another who doesn\\'t want to be identified as the owner. The SEC charged that, in certain cases, Mr. Jefferies helped mask Mr. Boesky\\'s identity, and that in others the arrangement was reversed.  The developments are dramatic confirmation that the government\\'s investigation has moved far beyond insider trading. People familiar with the investigation said Mr. Jefferies, who is cooperating fully with the government, has described other instances of parking and stock manipulation, suggesting that the illegal practices have been widespread on Wall Street.  In a letter to shareholders of publicly traded Jefferies Group, Mr. Jefferies, who resigned yesterday as chairman, said, \"I fully accept sole responsibility for these transactions\" and \"it is with deep personal sorrow and regret that I leave the company that has been my life for the past 25 years.\" He emphasized that neither he nor the company engaged in insider trading and didn\\'t breach \"any trust or confidence placed in us by our customers.\"  As part of his settlement, the 56-year-old Mr. Jefferies was barred from the securities industry for at least five years and placed his personal 13% stake in Jefferies Group in a voting trust.  Frank Baxter, 50, who has been president and chief operating officer of Jefferies, became the new chief executive.  In national over-the-counter trading, Jefferies\\'s shares closed at $11, down 25 cents.  The SEC also censured Jefferies &amp; Co., the company\\'s securities trading unit, and ordered the unit to retain an outside consultant to review its procedures designed to detect violations of securities laws. No fines were imposed. On Wall Street, the penalties were generally deemed to be light, given the scope of the offenses charged, and suggest that Mr. Jefferies\\'s cooperation is important to the government.  The market manipulation charge was the most startling of the offenses alleged yesterday by the SEC because it has nothing to do with Mr. Boesky or insider trading, and implicates other individuals and firms. Mr. Jefferies was charged with manipulating the price of a stock involved in a 1986 secondary public stock offering at the request of an unnamed person. Allegedly, he bought huge blocks of the stock at or near the close of trading to boost its price, thereby affecting the price of the public offering the next day.  The SEC refused to identify the person or the companies involved. But people familiar with the government\\'s investigation said the transaction described is an eight-million unit offering of stock and warrants of Fireman\\'s Fund by American Express last May. American Express received $332 million from the offering, which was underwritten by a syndicate led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express subsidiary.  According to the SEC charges, Jefferies, at the request of the unnamed individual, agreed to drive up the stock price by buying the blocks. In return, the person agreed to indemnify Jefferies for any loss incurred in buying and holding the stock. Jefferies subsequently sold its shares at a loss and was reimbursed. To disguise the payment, Jefferies issued a fraudulent invoice to the person for alleged \"investment banking services,\" and later, at the person\\'s request, issued another fraudulent invoice to someone else.  The people familiar with the case wouldn\\'t identify any of the individuals involved, but said the person who initiated the arrangement had ties to officials of American Express. The SEC noted that the issuer had received firm commitments from its underwriters for the offering, meaning that the underwriters bore the risks of any decline in the price of the stock just before the offering.  Neither American Express, Shearson, Salomon nor any individuals at those firms were charged with wrongdoing in connection with the Jefferies case. Both the SEC and the U.S. attorney\\'s office said investigations of the offering are continuing.  Spokesmen for American Express and Salomon Brothers declined to comment.  The \"parking\" charges, while extensive, came as less of a surprise. This newspaper reported last November that Mr. Jefferies was under investigation, and later disclosed that a $3 million payment from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. to Jefferies was being examined by the SEC as part of a suspected parking scheme. That invoice, purportedly for \"investment advisory and corporate financial services,\" was identified yesterday by the SEC as an important part of the alleged parking scheme between Mr. Boesky and Mr. Jefferies. The similar fraudulent invoice prepared by Mr. Jefferies in connection with the market manipulation scheme is entirely separate, the SEC alleged.  As alleged by the SEC, Boesky and Jefferies entities secretly held stock positions belonging to the other, and agreed to \"buy back\" the positions and reimburse each other for carrying costs and any losses incurred on the holdings. Periodically, the two netted out the profits on the holdings, the SEC charged.  The agency charged that in one instance last March, involving a $27 million, 500,000-share position in G.D. Searle &amp; Co. parked by Mr. Boesky with Jefferies, the price dropped about $7 a share, and Mr. Jefferies demanded that Mr. Boesky buy back the stake and repay him immediately for part of the loss. Mr. Boesky did so, giving Mr. Jefferies the payment of about $3 million, and Mr. Jefferies in turn supplied Mr. Boesky with the phony invoice, the SEC charged.  The SEC charged that besides Searle, Mr. Boesky parked with Jefferies an $11.7 million, 810,000-share position in Cooper Laboratories Inc. and a $17.3 million, 600,000-share position in Southland Financial Corp.  Mr. Jefferies, in turn, parked with Boesky entities positions in American Broadcasting Cos., Ideal Basic Industries Inc., ITT Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Pioneer Corp. and Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. -- a total of $43 million in stock -- the SEC alleged.  As reported, the SEC is also examining a $5.3 million payment last March from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. After the payment was made and questioned by Mr. Boesky\\'s auditors, Drexel, a major securities firm, sent Mr. Boesky an invoice for \"consulting and advisory services.\"  The government is seeking to determine whether the payment was actually part of a parking arrangement involving Mr. Boesky and Drexel similar to the one between Messrs. Boesky and Jefferies, according to persons familiar with the investigation. Drexel has repeatedly characterized the payment as an \"investment banking fee\" and denied any impropriety. Mr. Jefferies is understood to be providing new details about Drexel\\'s relationship with Jefferies.  At a news conference yesterday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said Mr. Jefferies will plead guilty \"in the very near future\" to a criminal violation of margin requirements and aiding and abetting the falsification of the records of a Boesky-controlled brokerage house. He said it was Mr. Boesky who first implicated Mr. Jefferies.  As reported, Mr. Boesky has agreed to plead guilty to one felony charge for his role in the scandal. Mr. Giuliani added that the relationship between the Jefferies case and the massive insider-trading scandal \"will become clearer in the next couple of weeks.\"  The SEC said that, among other provisions, Mr. Jefferies violated anti-fraud laws, disclosure requirements, books and record-keeping provisions, net capital requirements and margin requirements.  As the Justice Department\\'s charges reflect, willful violations of many provisions of the securities laws are criminal offenses. While these laws have long been on the books, many on Wall Street have taken a cavalier attitude toward the more technical aspects of securities laws.  Peter H. Morrison, a partner in the New York law firm of Morrison Cohen &amp; Singer, Mr. Jefferies\\' lawyer, noted that Mr. Jefferies \"was accommodating customers. He grew up in the business accommodating customers. The rules are changing.\"  --- William Power contributed to this article.  ---  A Chronology of the Stock-Trading Scandal May 12, 1986 -- SEC charges Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6 million since mid-1980 from insider trading.

       " 'WSJ870320-0123': 'Gleason to Retire --- By Teri Agins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) </IN> Longshoremen union chief Thomas W. \"Teddy\" Gleason will retire when his term expires in July.  The International Longshoremen\\'s Association, of which Mr. Gleason has been president since 1963, said he will announce his retirement today at a meeting of the union\\'s 26-member executive council in Tampa, Fla. The ILA said its 86-year-old leader will recommend John M. Bowers, the union\\'s executive vice president, 61, to be named as his successor.  One New York shipping industry source described Mr. Gleason as \"one of the toughest negotiators around, right out of the \\'30s.\" The source suggested that if Mr. Bowers does replace Mr. Gleason, he will reign in the same manner, \"although he\\'s more low-key . . . Bowers has been executive vice president for as long as Teddy has been president.\"  A third-generation dockworker, Mr. Gleason, a native New Yorker, first joined the union, which represents dockworkers on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in 1919. Through the years, Mr. Gleason led the union in several strikes resulting in negotiations that elevated the pay and benefits for longshoremen. They now earn $17 an hour, or about $32,300 a year.  The New York Shipping Association called Mr. Gleason \"a forceful and effective advocate of the interest of his union members.\"  Nowadays, there are fewer longshoremen\\'s jobs. The increased use of containerized shipping, where cargo is loaded into containers and then shipped directly to the destination, has eliminated much of the handling of cargo at the docks. The local longshoremen\\'s membership in New York Harbor, as high as 31,574 in 1955, has now shrunk to about 7,312 members.  For years, some of the union\\'s officials have been identified by law enforcement officers as members or associates of organized crime. In 1981, when Mr. Gleason testified before a Senate subcommittee investigating racketeering on the waterfront, he denied accusations that he was influenced by organized crime.  One of the high points in his career was in the mid-1960s, when Mr. Gleason helped the union negotiate a contract with guaranteed annual-income provisions. In the latest round of negotiations, held in 1986, the union was forced to accept wage concessions in order to be competitive with the growing number of low-cost nonunion stevedoring operations. Under the 1986 contract, the union agreed to a wage freeze for the first two years.  James Kirk, director of the port department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, noted that the new ILA union leadership will contend with a membership no longer unified under a master wage contract. In the latest round of negotiations, ILA union membership at different ports negotiated separate contracts. For shippers, the regional differences in the ILA salaries \"will become a factor in the cost of doing business,\" Mr. Kirk said. \"It changes the basic ground rules.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0122': 'To Change His Governing Style, Poll Shows --- By Ellen Hume Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Most Americans feel that President Reagan is increasingly less relevant to the governing of the country, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates.  The nationwide survey, which was conducted from Sunday through Tuesday, suggests that Mr. Reagan\\'s recent efforts to reinvigorate his presidency haven\\'t convinced people that he can regain his standing as a strong national leader. Rather, many seem to regard him as being too uninvolved in decision making, and unlikely to change.  When the 2,153 adults in the poll were asked to choose who they thought will exert the most influence on the policies and decisions made in the White House during the next two years, Mr. Reagan finished third, behind new White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and members of the cabinet. Only 27% thought Mr. Reagan would have the most influence over his own White House.  Moreover, most people don\\'t believe that Mr. Reagan is capable of changing his management style to meet the criticisms of the Tower Commission\\'s devastating report on the Iran-Contra affair. Fully 56% said the president is \"too set in his ways\" to change, while 40% said he will alter his management style.  That finding follows Mr. Reagan\\'s efforts since the report was issued to show that he is taking command -- efforts that have included the replacement of former Chief of Staff Donald Regan with Mr. Baker, a nationally televised speech and the appointment of FBI Director William Webster to be director of central intelligence. Despite all those steps, though, 54% of those polled said Mr. Reagan doesn\\'t pay enough attention to major policy issues involving his administration, up from 46% in January.  The poll wasn\\'t all bad news for the president. Fifty-two percent of those polled say they look to Mr. Reagan for \"leadership on the direction the country is going.\" And 65% now believe that he is healthy and vigorous enough to be an effective president during the next two years, up from 60% in a Journal/NBC poll in January.  But more than three-quarters of those polled think the president isn\\'t as strong a leader now as he was during his first term, and a majority -- 54% -- now say his performance as president is \"only fair\" or \"poor.\" In January, 50% gave him such unfavorable marks.  As in the January poll, Americans still believe by a 2-to-1 margin that Mr. Reagan isn\\'t as fully in charge of his administration as he ought to be. The public now is even less convinced that he is doing all he can to solve the problems created by the sale of arms to Iran: 46% say yes, 49% say no. In January, 50% said yes and 42% said no. However, 52% don\\'t think he should resign even if it turns out that he knew about the diversion of funds to the Contras, while 41% say he should.  There\\'s little good news for the president on policy matters, according to the poll. His policy of aiding the Nicaraguan Contras remains very unpopular: 58% disapprove, and 29% approve.  And most say they want a budget compromise with Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit even if it results in a tax increase, which Mr. Reagan adamantly opposes. The poll found that 53% favor a compromise even if it includes a tax increase, while 40% don\\'t favor such a compromise.  Mr. Reagan\\'s problems seem to have spilled over to the Republican Party. Those polled are almost evenly divided about which party can best handle the nation\\'s economic problems and relations with the Soviet Union; in the January poll, they gave the GOP a strong edge in both areas. Republicans also have lost ground and now hold only a marginal advantage in the public\\'s rating of which party would better handle inflation and the federal budget deficit.  In foreign affairs, the poll shows, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s public-relations efforts seem to have had an impact on Americans as well as Russians. While most of those polled still don\\'t believe the Soviets can be trusted to live up to an agreement to relax tensions, the gap is narrowing. Fifty-nine percent now say the Soviets can\\'t be trusted, while 32% say they can; in a similar Journal/NBC poll last October, the margin was 74% to 16%.  Nearly half say the arrival of Howard Baker as the new chief of staff makes an agreement on controlling nuclear arms more likely in the next two years, while 18% think it will make an agreement less likely and 12% think it won\\'t have any effect.  But there still hasn\\'t been any burst of public optimism that such an accord will actually be attained by the end of Mr. Reagan\\'s term. More than three times as many people think such an accord isn\\'t likely at all as believe it is very likely -- a ratio that is unchanged from last October\\'s survey.  --- \\'During the next two years, whom do you think will have the most influence on the policies and decisions made in the White House?\\'  White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker 31%  Cabinet members                                   29% President Reagan 27%  Nancy Reagan                                       6% Not sure 7%  \\'As you may know, the Tower Commission report on the Iran-Contra affair criticized some of President Reagan\\'s management practices within the White House.

       " 'WSJ870320-0120': '--- Early to Bed... The Motto of Ben Franklin Has Become The M.O. of Many a Chief Executive --- Compiled by Wall Street Journal Staff Reporter Amanda Bennett from Bureau Reports</HL> Minnesota financier Irwin Jacobs leaves the office every day at 5:30 p.m. -- or 5:45 p.m. if necessary. He doesn\\'t think hanging around the office late is a good idea, and he rarely works weekends.  But the chairman of Minstar Inc., an investment group he controls, puts in a full day\\'s work nonetheless. He reports to his desk at 7 a.m. each day, having already finished the morning newspapers and checked up on Europe through a call from his car phone.  Chief executive officers are a hardworking lot, but you may not know it by looking at them. You may still be in bed when they\\'re getting their best work done. A lot of CEOs, it seems, think they perform best before the sun comes up, the coffee wagon comes around, or subordinates come in with phone messages, memos and meetings.  Forty-hour weeks are rare for those at the top; fifty and more hours are more the norm. In a Wall Street Journal survey of chief executives of the nation\\'s largest corporations, nearly two-thirds said they worked between 10 and 11 hours a day, Monday through Friday. Most of them also reported working on weekends; nearly 60% claimed between one and five hours of weekend work.  How do they cope? CEOs make time where they can find it. They work in cars, trains and planes. They mull strategy in the shower, plot planning by the pool. Their hardest task: Finding time for themselves.  Mr. Jacobs gets up at 5:30 a.m. to get everything he wants done. But he\\'s by no means the earliest bird among his peers. Fred Carr, chairman of First Executive Corp., awakens around 5 a.m., and Gordon McGovern, president and chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., routinely rises at 4:30 a.m. \"I grew up in the baking business where you get up early to deliver the bread,\" he says.  It isn\\'t always easy. Kenneth Monfort, chief executive officer of Monfort of Colorado Inc., a beef packing concern, starts his day at 7 a.m. to get a jump on cattle futures markets, which are important for his business. \"I\\'m not a good waker-upper. I can barely talk when I get up and I practice talking to myself on the way to work,\" he says.  By coming in early, chief executives avoid, for a time, the demands of the bureaucracy. \"All day long there\\'s a constant stream of people coming through my office telling me what\\'s going on,\" says Mr. McGovern, who does a few hours\\' work at home before reporting to work at 7:30 a.m. Agrees Jack Reichert, chairman, president and chief executive of Brunswick Corp.: \"I like a little quiet at the beginning of the day and at the end to maintain my sanity.\"  One problem: Too many other people are catching on to the trick. \"I find I have emigrated to the country of breakfast meetings,\" says Robert B. Horton, chairman and chief executive of Standard Oil Co., who until last April was a top executive at British Petroleum in London, where such meetings were unusual.  \"In London I would get to the office by 8 or 8:15 and have a full hour before the telephone rang. Now I get in at 7:30 and I\\'m lucky to have 15 minutes.\"  Traveling takes a big chunk of a CEO\\'s time. Chief Executive magazine reports that its readers take, on average, 24 business trips a year. \"In the past seven or eight months, I\\'ve taken more than one airplane flight a day, on average,\" says Charles E. Cobb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Arvida Disney Corp., a unit of Walt Disney Co.  B. Charles Ames, chairman and chief executive of Acme-Cleveland Corp., averages just two days a week in the office. The rest of the time he\\'s visiting facilities around the world. Some recent visits included a plant near the Black Forest in Germany and one just outside London. \"It\\'s very important to spend time in the field with the first-line people,\" he says.  Evenings are often work times, too. \"When I leave the office, I often don\\'t go home,\" says James Sylla, president of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a unit of Chevron Corp. On Monday of one recent week he had a meeting in Tulsa; on Wednesday he had dinner with a company management development team back in San Francisco; on Thursday there was a reception and dinner for some Japanese contractors; and on Friday he attended a dinner honoring retirees. Tuesday night he goofed off and went to a ball game.  Some chief executives stop just short of making the office their home. While he tries not to use his apartment at General Motors Corp. headquarters, Chairman Roger Smith does eat breakfast at work to save time. Warren L. Batts, chairman and chief executive of Premark International Inc., a Northbrook, Ill.-based maker of consumer and restaurant products, arrives early and exercises at the company.  Others bring part of the office home. Mr. Cobb does long-term planning in the shower. Paul Frison, president and chief executive at LifeCell Corp., a medical supplies company in Houston, dictates memos while watching \"the more boring part of a baseball game.\" And on weekends, he says, if he didn\\'t do paper work by the pool, his wife and children \"would think I was ill.\"  Donald Frey, chairman and chief executive of Bell &amp; Howell Co., thinks about work problems while making cabinets, beds and tables at home. He scribbles ideas down on nearby napkins or on shreds of newspapers. Later, he says, \"I take these odd-looking pieces of paper with notes on them, and write them out nicely.\"  \"I deliberately live close to the office so I don\\'t waste a lot of time commuting,\" says Mr. Batts of Premark International. Others turn the commute into part of the workday. Mr. Horton of Standard Oil is driven to work from his home about 40 minutes east of the company\\'s Cleveland office; the drive gives him \"more than an hour of productive time\" a day.  Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief executive of GAF Corp., in Wayne, N.J., commutes to work by helicopter from his Westport, N.J., home, cutting the two-hour commute to a half-hour.

       " 'WSJ870320-0118': 'Aim to Reverse Image Damage --- By Jane Mayer Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> With President Reagan now largely recovered from his prostate surgery, his wife Nancy took to the road, partly to heal her own wounds.  Bruised by negative publicity surrounding her not-so-behind-the-scenes efforts to oust then White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan last month, the first lady yesterday returned to a less controversial role: addressing the Parents\\' Resource Institute for Drug Education\\'s annual conference in Atlanta, part of stepped-up travel plans for the next few months.  \"She\\'s going to jump on the drug bandwagon, get out on the road and stop minding the store,\" says one Republican official knowledgeable about the first lady\\'s strategy to counter recent unfavorable reviews. \"It\\'s partly because her husband is better. But it\\'s also a lot of damage control.\"  Not so, says Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan\\'s spokeswoman. \"It\\'s not new -- anything suggesting we\\'re changing her image is just malarky.\" She notes that Mrs. Reagan\\'s drug efforts are longstanding. And she asserts that the first lady\\'s image doesn\\'t need any burnishing.  But a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted from Sunday through Tuesday suggests the first lady plainly has been hurt by the public\\'s growing perception that she has too much influence over her husband. Of those polled, an unusually high 39% thought the president lets himself be influenced too much by his wife, 53% didn\\'t think so and 8% weren\\'t sure. Mrs. Reagan still enjoys a high 61% overall approval rating, but that has fallen 13 points since last April and her disapproval rating has more than tripled to 26%.  While only 8% of those polled thought Mrs. Reagan should wield \"a great deal of influence,\" 38% thought that she currently does, a jump of 16 points since last April. But if many think she\\'s too influential, still only a small minority, 6%, think that over the next two years she\\'ll be the main power in the White House.  Confidants of the first lady say that she has been frustrated and hurt by the drubbing she received in the days surrounding Mr. Regan\\'s Feb. 27 resignation, and she has been anxious to limit any damage. After New York Times columnist William Safire\\'s March 2 column charging that her \"political interference\" was making her husband \"appear wimpish and helpless,\" Mrs. Reagan sought advice about what to do from friends inside and outside the White House, among them presidential pollster Richard Wirthlin.  Mr. Wirthlin declines to discuss any meetings he might have had with the first lady. But sources close to the two say that it was agreed that the best tack for Mrs. Reagan to take was to return with renewed vigor to the drug issue, and to be very careful about appearing to meddle in substantive policy issues. Whatever else she does, she must not, as one source put it, \"go pounding on (new White House Chief of Staff) Howard Baker every day.\"  In this effort to improve her image, Mrs. Reagan has had a lot of help, both from a spontaneous backlash brought on by media overkill and also from some old friends who led the way on her defense. One of them, Director Charles Z. Wick of the U.S. Information Agency, suggests that without ever being asked to, her supporters launched a virtual public-relations campaign. \"It was like what we call a \\'propaganda alert,\\'\" says Mr. Wick. \"You counter it (the negative publicity) the same way you counter Soviet disinformation: You send out the truth to as widespread an audience as possible.\"  Thus Mr. Wick and other friends of the first lady fanned out across a dizzying array of television and radio talk shows, at the same time filling the op-ed pages and political columns of some of the most prestigious journals in the nation. Mr. Wick did five television appearances in less than a week. Mrs. Reagan\\'s former press secretary, Sheilah Tate, hit the television circuit and also co-authored an op-ed piece for the New York Times with one of the first lady\\'s longtime friends, Nancy Reynolds. Mrs. Reagan was shown an advance copy and gave it her blessing.  Similarly, pundit George Will, who had one of his celebrated lunches recently with Mrs. Reagan, devoted part of his March 6 Washington Post column to her defense. While he criticized her husband for displaying \"an essentially passive presidential function\" in the Iran-Contra affair, he mocked the first lady\\'s critics. He also offered a helpful example of her reluctance to meddle, suggesting that when Howard Baker asked Mrs. Reagan her opinion of the appointment of William Webster to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \"she recoiled, saying she did not want to have opinions about everything.\"  In the process of championing Mrs. Reagan\\'s right to play a role in her husband\\'s affairs, her defenders have stirred an outpouring of anti-sexist sentiment, not Mrs. Reagan\\'s usual cause. The first lady\\'s staff has wryly enjoyed the fact that even the Washington Post columnist Judy Mann, a tough critic in the past, on March 6 called President Reagan \"a lucky man\" for being married to Nancy.  And in making the case for a strong-willed wife, Mrs. Reagan\\'s champions may have reopened the so-called gender gap. More women than men, 65% vs. 57% according to the most recent poll, approve of her. \"There are a lot of unsung, powerful wives out there who understand,\" suggests Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors Association. And apparently, a lot of husbands who don\\'t.  --- Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: \"President Reagan lets himself be influenced too much by his wife.\"  Agree: 39% Disagree: 53% Not sure: 8% The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0117': 'Aide Pleads Guilty In Criminal Case --- By William Power Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> Gary Eder, formerly a top stockbroker at PaineWebber Inc., pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and creation of false brokerage records.  Mr. Eder, who resigned as a PaineWebber vice president last month, admitted in Manhattan federal court yesterday that he helped various wealthy customers of the firm hide at least $700,000 from the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Eder was indicted on the charges last week.  Attorneys for Mr. Eder strongly disputed the government\\'s characterization of the crime last week as a \"money-laundering scheme.\" One attorney, Michael Feldberg, said the case was unrelated to insider trading or possible laundering of illegal profits. He said Mr. Eder was only helping customers avoid paying taxes. \"The acts occurred years ago before any of the current Wall Street hysteria,\" Mr. Feldberg said.  As part of a plea agreement, Mr. Eder, 41 years old, is cooperating in a continuing investigation. The government said the money scheme occurred with the \"approval and participation\" of other PaineWebber supervisors at the branch at 1221 Ave. of the Americas in Manhattan.  In his appearance before federal Judge Edmund L. Palmieri, Mr. Eder said he \"absolutely\" was guilty of the two counts. \"I\\'d like to get these charges behind me and move forward with my life,\" he said.  Though he said he didn\\'t profit directly from the scheme, Mr. Eder told Judge Palmieri that the series of transactions did generate extra brokerage commissions for himself.  Mr. Eder, of Woodmere, N.Y., was PaineWebber\\'s most highly paid broker and its biggest producer, at any office, from 1982 to 1986, according to the government.  Judge Palmieri released Mr. Eder on his own recognizance and set sentencing for May 27. Mr. Eder faces a maximum 10 years in prison and a $260,000 fine.  Separately, Bentley P. Whitfield, a former account executive and broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., pleaded innocent in Manhattan federal court to mail fraud charges filed against him last week. Mr. Whitfield, 31 years old, denied charges that he diverted $8,400 intended for Merrill Lynch to his own use. Mr. Whitfield was released on his own recognizance pending a trial. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0116': '--- Life After the Top: Retired Chiefs Discover That There\\'s A New World Outside the Corner Office --- By Linda M. Watkins</HL> Life at the top isn\\'t easy. But life after life at the top poses problems, too.  The big question: What to do in retirement?  Running a Fortune 500 company often isn\\'t just a job, but a way of life. At times exhilarating, at times numbing, it\\'s an endless series of meetings, of multimillion-dollar decisions, of 60-hour workweeks, of business breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  For some, retirement is a welcome and well-earned respite, a time to slow down and do things they never had time to do before. But for others, a life of leisure is a life of boredom. Indeed, many retired top executives return to business within six months, according to a 1984 study by Russell Reynolds Associates Inc., an executive recruiting firm. \"Leaving it all behind could be a blow to the ego if the individual hasn\\'t accepted the move,\" says David Merrill, who counseled executives before he himself retired from Rohrer, Hibler &amp; Replogle, a consulting firm.  A glimpse at four former chief executive officers of Fortune 500 companies -- one who really has retired, one who is working as hard as ever, one who left corporate life abruptly at age 55 and one who is championing business solutions for social problems -- shows how different retirement can be.  --- On a recent winter day, the temperature hovered around the freezing mark in Pittsburgh, home of Westinghouse Electric Corp. But it was a balmy 75 degrees in the Naples, Fla., area, home of Robert Kirby, the company\\'s 68-year-old retired chairman.  He got up at 6 a.m., browsed through the newspaper, did the crossword puzzle and monitored his stocks. After perusing his mail, it was out to the golf course adjacent to his spacious Spanish villa-style home for a four-hour round with friends. In the late afternoon he returned home, taped some music (big band jazz is his favorite, and he has 3,000 tapes) and enjoyed a quiet dinner (hot dogs and baked beans). Then Mr. Kirby ended the day by plunking himself in front of the television to take in a basketball game and an America\\'s Cup yacht race.  Other chief executives may feel lost away from the hustle and bustle of corporate life, but not Mr. Kirby, who retired in 1983 after serving nine years as chairman of the electrical equipment and broadcasting concern. \"I don\\'t miss it,\" Mr. Kirby says. At Westinghouse, he put in 12-hour to 14-hour days -- often followed by business dinners -- and traveled frequently. \"When you\\'re chairman, you have to do things when others want you to do it,\" Mr. Kirby recalls. \"Down here, I set the schedule. That, to me, is really great.\"  Mr. Kirby, planning for a life of leisure, bought his home in an exclusive enclave of Naples in 1981. \"I was really looking forward to being able to relax as much as possible and spend time on things I didn\\'t have time to when I was working,\" he says. That means golf at least four times a week and frequent dips in his outdoor swimming pool and backyard Jacuzzi. And each year, to escape Florida\\'s steamy weather, Mr. Kirby and his wife, Barbara, spend summers at their home in Pittsburgh.  Of course, it isn\\'t all the life of Riley for Mr. Kirby. He stays active as a director of the Professional Golf Association tour, a director of Mellon Bank -- where, he notes, he keeps his money -- and chairman of the University of Pittsburgh\\'s board, among other things. Still, he turns down invitations to serve on other boards, and his current obligations require only about 50 meetings a year -- far fewer than he had to squeeze into his hectic schedule before retiring.  --- \"I\\'d rather wear out than rust out,\" declares Kemmons Wilson, the founder and former chairman of Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Inns Inc.  When Mr. Wilson retired in 1979 from the company he started 27 years earlier, it was for all of three weeks -- and that was spent recuperating from a heart attack and open heart surgery. Then it was back to work. Now 74 years old, Mr. Wilson still puts in 12-hour days at Kemmons Wilson Co., a company that he founded in 1935 and that his three sons run.  By the time he left Holiday Inns (currently named Holiday Corp.), Kemmons Wilson already owned or had stakes in 25 businesses, from small hotel chains to cemeteries. The entrepreneurial Mr. Wilson has expanded it by adding a nacho corn chip and jalapeno pepper dip company, a time share resort in Florida and a savings and loan association, among others. \"I would go crazy if I didn\\'t have anything to do,\" he says.  Most of the day-to-day operations are left to other executives or partners, but Mr. Wilson still keeps tabs on things. He spends about six hours a day in his office sifting through mail, answering telephone messages and dictating letters. Just like his old office at Holiday Inns, his new office has about 100 awards and plaques hanging from the walls and a large portrait of his mother hanging over his desk.  The rest of the time, Mr. Wilson visits his nearby businesses to check things out. Strolling through his Wilson World hotel and conference center recently, he was constantly interrupted by onlookers wanting to shake his hand. Mr. Wilson\\'s family was poor when he was growing up in Memphis, but today he is one of the city\\'s best-known citizens. \"We call him Mr. Memphis,\" says Mayor Richard Hackett, who joined Mr. Wilson for soft vanilla ice cream.  Several months ago, Mr. Wilson took his first extended vacation since 1951, and even that was just for six days. But life isn\\'t all work. To relax, he goes hunting with his sons, plays tennis and joins the family\\'s weekly Sunday dinner gatherings.  His advice to other retiring chief executives? \"Get out and get another job as quickly as you can,\" he says. \"You can\\'t play golf and make love all day.\"  --- Most chief executives retire in their 60s. Archie McCardell retired -- unexpectedly -- at 55.  When Mr. McCardell became chief executive of International Harvester Co. in 1978 at age 51, there was every reason to think he would be around for a long time. But after a lengthy strike and recession led to steep losses at the maker of farm equipment and trucks, Mr. McCardell left under a cloud in May 1982. Despite reports that he was ousted, Mr. McCardell says he left on his own accord. \"I was relieved. And I felt no bitterness,\" he recalls.  Still, for a while Mr. McCardell didn\\'t know what to do. Lacking any plans, he decided simply to relax and think things over. For several months, he didn\\'t do much more than sleep, jog and play golf and tennis. He slimmed down, dropping 20 pounds. In between the sports, he tended to his personal finances, setting up trusts for his three children.  He passed up opportunities to return to corporate life. Soon after leaving Harvester (since renamed Navistar International Corp.), for example, Mr. McCardell received offers to become chief executive at several companies. \"I didn\\'t see anything that turned me on,\" he recalls.  Six months after he retired, Mr. McCardell\\'s daughter, Sandy, and her husband asked him to go into business with them and his other two children. \"We thought he was our greatest asset,\" remembers Raul Arcenas, the son-in-law. Mr. McCardell accepted the offer, becoming chairman of ARM Properties Inc., a residential real estate concern, and ARM Enterprises Inc., a management firm that advises ailing small businesses.  At Harvester, Mr. McCardell put in 13 hours a day, spent evenings with a briefcase full of work and often took aspirin in the morning to relieve headaches. \"There was no time to do anything other than work,\" he recalls. At ARM, he usually works seven or eight hours a day, most of the time advising family members, who handle day-to-day operations. He often takes off four or five days a month, which gives him plenty of time to commute between his ivy-covered mansion in Fairfield, Conn., and homes in Florida, Canada and upstate New York, and to play golf and tennis.  Retiring early, Mr. McCardell now says, has worked out to his liking. \"Don\\'t wait until you\\'re 65,\" he advises other top executives. \"Do it while you still have energy. The older you get, the less flexible you are.\"  --- William Norris vividly remembers his last day as chairman of Control Data Corp. in January 1986. \"The day I walked out of my office, I felt a little tug in my belly, like when I left the (family) farm in Nebraska to take a job at Westinghouse Electric,\" he says. \"It was the realization that an important chapter in my life had ended.\"  But not the last chapter. A year after retiring, the 75-year-old Mr. Norris -- who founded Control Data in 1957 -- is still going strong. Instead of beginning a second business career like many retired executives, however, Mr. Norris is pursuing his avocation -- preaching about ways that business can help solve America\\'s problems.  To spread his gospel, Mr. Norris is giving at least three lectures a month around the U.S. His favorite topics: how U.S. computer companies can combat foreign rivals (by sharing technology), how America can create more jobs (by helping people start and grow small businesses) and how education can be improved (by expanding computer-based education).  Mr. Norris\\'s proselytizing on these topics resulted in more criticism than praise when he was running Control Data. Critics inside and outside the company contended that he was so busy promoting these issues that it distracted Control Data from its main business of selling computers, and resulted in losses in his final two years at the helm; the company has axed many of his pet programs. But now, though he remains a director of Control Data and is a consultant to the company, he can say what he wants without causing grumbles.  Because he operates out of a Control Data office across the street from the company\\'s headquarters in Bloomington, Minn., much of his daily routine has stayed the same. Still, some things are different. \"He\\'s as busy as ever, but probably a little more relaxed,\" says Betty Jane, his wife for 43 years, noting that Mr. Norris has more time to swim, fish and go for walks. \"He talks in his sleep less often than he used to. I interpreted that as tenseness when the company was under a lot of pressure.\"  --- Ms. Watkins is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal\\'s Boston bureau. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0115': '--- By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The House Budget Committee approved a cutback of nearly $8 billion in military spending next year, indicating general concurrence with a $36 billion deficit-reduction proposal floated by Democratic leaders.  With Republicans abstaining, the Democrat-controlled panel voted 13-8 to set military outlays at $282.6 billion in fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. While that\\'s a $6 billion increase from this fiscal year\\'s spending, it\\'s a $7.9 billion reduction from the $290.5 billion the Defense Department would have to spend to keep pace with inflation.  The vote is a firm rebuke to President Reagan, who requested outlays of $298 billion, and it is close to the $9 billion reduction that House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) had proposed.  Rep. Wright is seeking a deficit-reduction package that would trim $9 billion from projected military spending, $9 billion from nonmilitary outlays and an $18 billion tax increase in fiscal 1988.  Rep. Butler Derrick (D., S.C.) declared the decision \"very close\" to the package that the Democrats have been considering. It was supported by both Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) and House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).  The military spending figure has been the most controversial and pivotal budget issue. Conservative Democrats had been resisting so large a cut and, in turn, liberals had resisted trimming social programs until a significant military reduction was agreed to.  The most liberal and most conservative members of the budget panel voted against the figure. But now that the majority sentiment has been expressed, the way is clear for approval soon of the entire $36 billion deficit-reduction package floated by the Democratic leaders.  The budget is a long way from completion, however. Both the House and Senate must approve their own versions of a deficit-reduction plan and then reconcile the two. The Senate is likely to want a far higher military spending number than the House panel approved yesterday.  As illustrated by the split vote in the committee, House approval might also involve a fight. Republicans, who were protesting the entire process by refusing to vote yesterday, could gang up with conservative Democrats to create problems for any budget resolution that sharply cuts the military.  In addition, the military spending figure voted yesterday was tentative and might be adjusted later should the Democratic leadership devise a substitute plan. ',\n",

First Financial, noting that Comdata has signed a letter of intent to be acquired by a New York venture capital concern in a $285.6 million transaction, said it wouldn\\'t pursue its proposal if it isn\\'t accepted by Comdata directors.  A Comdata spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the offer.  Under terms of the offer, Comdata holders would receive half a share of First Financial common for each Comdata share, provided that the market value of First Financial isn\\'t less than $28 a share, said First Financial, a provider of data processing services and products. The cash portion would be determined by the average market price of First Financial shares during the period shortly before completion of the transaction. The formula is designed to limit the cash portion to no more than $4 per share, a First Financial spokeswoman said.  M. Tarlton Pittard, First Financial\\'s executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company would give only stock for Comdata if its average market price equals or exceeds $36 a share. He said the exchange ratio would remain at half a share for each Comdata share should First Financial\\'s average share price exceed $36.  As previously reported, Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, the New York-based venture capital concern, proposed to buy Comdata for cash or a combination of cash and securities. Under that proposal, holders would receive either $15 in cash or $10 and a unit of securities for each of Comdata\\'s approximately 19 million common shares outstanding. The proposal was subject to conditions, including Welsh Carson obtaining as much as $200 million in financing.  The Welsh Carson proposal supplanted a Comdata recapitalization proposal, under which Comdata would have purchased as many as six million of its common shares for $14.50 each.  Comdata shares closed yesterday at $16.375, up $1.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was more than one million shares. First Financial shares closed at $29.75, down $1.50, in national over-the-counter trading.  A group led by Rosewood Financial Inc., a Dallas investment firm, holds 6.2% of Comdata stock and had opposed the recapitalization plan. A spokesman for Rosewood didn\\'t return a phone call.  First Financial said it made an offer at this time in order to allow the Comdata directors to evaluate its offer and the Welsh Carson proposal. \"FFMC believes its proposal affords greater value to the Comdata shareholders,\" the company said.  The proposed transaction would be subject to approval of a definitive agreement by the boards of both companies, fairness opinions from the companies\\' investment bankers and the approval of Comdata holders, First Financial said.

So when Mr. Broad, 53, needs to let off a little steam, he simply strolls the halls of the home-building and insurance company to admire the paintings, wall reliefs and posters by Southern California artists.  \"Although I live with this art,\" he explains, \"if I want to feel good and relaxed, I\\'ll start looking at the paintings . . . and get my mind off the business problem before returning to it.\"  Learn a Lesson From the Past When H.J. Heinz Co.\\'s Anthony O\\'Reilly needs a break from the problems of the present, he turns to the past.  The 50-year-old former rugby player from Dublin says he likes to pick up a history book and read a bit when things get too hectic at the office. Currently Mr. O\\'Reilly is tackling a biography of William Gladstone, the 19th century British prime minister.  The chief executive also tells jokes to ease tension in the board room, and history is often the source. One of his favorites: During World War II Winston Churchill reported that \"the position\" in England was serious but not hopeless, \"and an Irishman listening said, \\'The position in Ireland was always hopeless, but happily never serious.\\'\"  Consult Your Beautician When running a chain of restaurants from her Beverly Hills, Calif., home gets too hectic for Marilyn Lewis, she pampers herself.  \"Getting my hair done or having my nails done relaxes me,\" says the 56-year-old chairman of Hamburger Hamlets Inc. A beauty break isn\\'t always the best medicine for the athletic executive, however. \"You\\'re sitting there on borrowed time, and it emphasizes what you haven\\'t done.\"  Dream On Grandma always said to take your nap. It\\'s something Armand Hammer hasn\\'t forgotten. When the 88-year-old chairman and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. wants to relieve stress at the office, he catches 40 winks. \"I have a pillow and a blanket in my closet,\" says Dr. Hammer. \"I pull the curtains and I take a nap for 15 or 20 minutes.\"  Hang in There Paul Oreffice is rarely more than arm\\'s length from a chinning bar.  The 59-year-old head of Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical Co. has chinning bars fastened in doorways at his two homes, and in his office closet. But he doesn\\'t use the bars for chin-ups: \"I just hang.\"  Mr. Oreffice says 30 seconds of hanging by the arms helps relieve the tension that builds up in his neck and back. He also likes to extend his legs and strengthen his thigh muscles while sitting at his desk, an isometric exercise he learned from physical therapists who helped him recover from an old football injury.  Even during lengthy board meetings, the six-foot, 180-pound executive remains active, tightening and releasing his stomach muscles. \"The great thing about isometrics is that nobody else knows I\\'m doing it.\" He says the stress-relieving exercises come in handy \"particularly during boring presentations.\"  Look on the Bright Side Andy Granatelli says that when he\\'s confronted with a stressful situation at work, he simply tells himself that things aren\\'t nearly as bad as they seem.  The 63-year-old former race car driver now owns and operates a chain of automobile service shops across the Southwest called Tuneup Masters. The bright side outlook keeps him from getting overheated when he\\'s caught in Los Angeles rush-hour freeway traffic.  \"I could get upset. But I say, \\'Look. All these motors are running now, and their motor oil and engines are running down. They\\'ll need tuneups soon.\\'\"  ...And Look Both Ways Before You Cross the Street  Martin S. Davis sums up his approach to stress-reduction: patience.  \"There\\'s stress everywhere. . . . You cross the street and it\\'s stressful. So you have the patience and you wait for the light to change,\" says the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of New York-based Gulf &amp; Western Industries Inc.  Mr. Davis says he doesn\\'t let himself get worked up over business problems. \"Part of the job of managing is managing stress,\" he says. \"You learn to have patience, and you can handle anything.\"  Think of the Funniest Things \"There was a time earlier in my career when I took myself too seriously,\" says William J. Popejoy, 48. \"When things went wrong, I was quicker to lash out.\"  Now when the chairman and chief executive of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America finds stress getting the better of him at work, he simply sits back and recalls the more light-hearted moments in his life. \"A little bit of laughter can relieve stress,\" he says.  Mr. Popejoy was named chairman and chief executive of Financial Corp., holding company for American Savings &amp; Loan Association, the nation\\'s largest thrift, in 1984 after Charles W. Knapp resigned the posts under intense pressure from federal regulators. Mr. Popejoy reminisces about the letters that flooded his office after he appeared in a television commercial for the thrift. \"One letter said, \\'You have old-time star-like qualities -- like Rin Tin Tin.\\'\"  He says memories of college athletic days are also good for a chuckle. Mr. Popejoy remembers one buddy who got \"so hyper\" before his event at a track-and-field meet that when he went to take off his sweatpants \"he took down everything\" -- in front of hundreds.  Stress? What Stress? Why not just face facts and relish the tooth-grinding, blood-pumping states of stressful bliss?  \"I thrive on it,\" says Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who has used the company he heads, Minstar Inc., to wage takeover battles against such hefty targets as Borg-Warner Corp. and AMF Inc. While some people like to avoid stressful situations, the 45-year-old executive says, \"I think of it as a way of life.\"  He adds, however, that he and his colleagues \"probably create more stress (for others) than we have\" ourselves.  --- Mr. Jefferson is a member of The Wall Street Journal\\'s Los Angeles bureau.

       " 'WSJ870320-0107': 'RJR Nabisco\\'s Sticht, 69, Who Retired As Chairman in \\'83, to Get Post Again --- By Betsy Morris Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> RJR Nabisco Inc. said it will bring back J. Paul Sticht, former chairman and chief executive officer, as chairman.  The appointment was made to provide a stabilizing influence, sources said. RJR has been rocked by change since the beginning of the year, when F. Ross Johnson, president, was named chief executive officer.  Mr. Sticht, 69 years old, retired as chairman in 1983 and is currently an RJR director and chairman of the executive committee. He will succeed as chairman J. Tylee Wilson, 55, who, as previously reported, is taking early retirement. The change is expected to take effect after a board vote on April 22, the date of RJR\\'s annual meeting.  RJR said Mr. Sticht will be chairman until April 1988, when, under company retirement policies, he will step down at age 70.  The company said the appointment of Mr. Sticht, who would focus on the company\\'s external affairs, would free Mr. Johnson to concentrate on running the business.  RJR said the appointment was suggested by Mr. Johnson. However, the move came as a surprise to those who had considered Mr. Johnson the likely successor to Mr. Wilson. Mr. Johnson, 55, had already taken swift control of the company, engineering the controversial impending move of its headquarters to Atlanta, completing the $1.2 billion sale of its liquor business and launching a study of a possible spinoff of RJR\\'s tobacco business into a master limited partnership.  But neither analysts nor sources close to the company said they thought Mr. Sticht\\'s appointment was designed to put the brakes on Mr. Johnson -- -or to affect his management of the company. \"Paul Sticht will be a statesman. He won\\'t be active in management,\" said an executive close to the company. \"Ross Johnson isn\\'t exactly a stabilizing influence in a new situation. Paul Sticht is. When the alligators are in the boat, he makes you feel very calm, keeps his hand on the tiller and the boat on course.\"  The appointment of Mr. Sticht, who was first named chairman in 1979, could be a calming influence on RJR\\'s tobacco business, which in the last three months has been shaken both by management changes and by the possibility of the spinoff. It could help smooth relations with the Winston-Salem community, which has also been badly shaken by RJR\\'s impending move.  The move wasn\\'t seen as a sign of board conflict. Mr. Johnson has had the support of the board and of Mr. Sticht, so powerful a director that some say he has been unofficial chairman all along.  This isn\\'t the first time Mr. Sticht has been plucked from the board to serve in a larger role. In 1973, a year after having retired as president of Federated Department Stores Inc., he was named president and chief operating officer of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc., where he was already a director. That positioned him to subsequently become the first non-tobacco chief executive of the company that became RJR, and he oversaw its first surge of diversification.  This time, Mr. Sticht\\'s new duties will include trade, customer and government relations, and he will be chairman of a council of advisers on the company\\'s international affairs.  Mr. Johnson was vice chairman and chief executive officer of Nabisco Brands Inc. when it was acquired by R.J. Reynolds for $4.9 billion in 1985. He became president and chief operating officer of the merged company.  In other changes, RJR named Mr. Johnson chairman of the executive committee, succeeding Mr. Sticht. James O. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the company\\'s Nabisco Brands Inc. unit, was named vice chairman of RJR, a title he shares with Edward A. Horrigan, chairman and chief executive of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Robert J. Carbonell, formerly executive vice president of RJR, was named senior executive vice president. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0106': \"AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN> General Motors Corp. will temporarily idle 3,500 hourly workers Monday when it halts production to adjust inventories on one of two assembly lines at its Lansing, Mich., car assembly plant.  The line, which builds the compact Buick Somerset and Skylark and the Oldsmobile Calais, will be down for two weeks, the company said. GM said the shutdown is designed to reduce bulging inventories of unsold cars.  Dealers had a 146-day supply of unsold Somersets on their lots at the end of February, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. That's more than double the 60-day to 65-day supply considered normal. Unsold inventories of the Calais model stood at 83 days.  Production of the Pontiac version of the cars, the Grand Am, will continue on the second line at the plant. That car has been much more popular than its Buick and Olds counterparts, with unsold supplies Feb. 28 at only 51 days.  GM said it plans to resume output of Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds Monday at its Norwood, Ohio, car assembly plant after a one-week closing because of material shortages.  U.S. car makers are scheduled to build 169,403 cars this week, up 1.2% from 167,443 cars last week. This week's expected output is down 4.6% from the year-earlier production of 177,588.  GM's estimated production is up 4.6% from last week's 85,087; Ford Motor Co.'s total will rise 2.6% to 43,938; and Chrysler Corp.'s will fall 13% to 19,400 from last week's 22,383. The Chrysler cuts were fairly evenly distributed throughout the company's product line.  GM said it scheduled one U.S. car assembly plant and four U.S. truck assembly plants for overtime tomorrow. Ford said it scheduled overtime tomorrow at one U.S. car and one truck assembly plant. Chrysler said it scheduled two U.S. car assembly plants for overtime Saturday.

       " 'WSJ870320-0103': 'Seeks Spinoff, Bar Against Greenmail --- BY Gregory Stricharchuk Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) RUBBER (RUB) CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN> FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) AEROSPACE (ARO) TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) A group that owns 6.5% of GenCorp Inc.\\'s stock suggested that the Akron, Ohio-based company spin off all of its non-broadcasting assets to shareholders and refuse to pay greenmail to any raider.  The spinoff proposal is the reverse of one that GenCorp\\'s management made several years ago to spin off GenCorp\\'s broadcast properties.  The investment group, which includes New York-based Gabelli Group Inc., is one of two groups to make a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week regarding GenCorp, a tires, plastics, aerospace and broadcasting concern. The Gabelli group advocates the spinoff as a way to \"materially narrow the spread between the public price of GenCorp\\'s shares and the underlying value.\"  The Gabelli filing was made just prior to a surprise tender offer for GenCorp\\'s shares. As previously reported, a group including AFG Industries Inc., an Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker and distributor, and Wagner &amp; Brown, a closely held Midland, Texas-based oil and gas concern, said in an SEC filing Wednesday that they had acquired 9.8% of GenCorp\\'s stock and had launched a $100-a-share tender offer for the remainder. However, the $2.2 billion offer is conditioned upon GenCorp withdrawing a \"poison pill\" anti-takeover defense and Federal Communications Commission approval of a voting trust arrangement for the broadcast properties.  The AFG group said it would sell GenCorp\\'s radio and television properties, its soft-drink bottling businesses and the Aerojet General aerospace and defense division.  According to the Gabelli SEC filing, the group requests that one of its representatives be elected to the GenCorp board to advance the spinoff proposal. The group said it first raised the proposal at a GenCorp meeting with securities analysts last month, but hasn\\'t had a private meeting with GenCorp management to discuss the issue.  The Gabelli group proposes that shareholders be precluded from selling shares to the company without prior approval by a shareholder vote. The group said that would eliminate a chance of greenmail, \"which is repugnant.\" Greenmail refers to a company buying back its shares at a premium from an unwanted suitor.  GenCorp has said it is studying the tender offer and urged shareholders to withhold a decision until March 31. A GenCorp spokesman said the company is aware of the Gabelli filing, but didn\\'t have an immediate comment.  The company for years has been puzzling over what to do with its broadcast properties. Several years ago, management considered spinning off its broadcast business to end disputes over licenses, but the FCC didn\\'t accept that remedy. Licenses for two of GenCorp\\'s three television stations and all 12 radio stations have been under challenge for two decades. Challenger groups allege that GenCorp is an unfit broadcaster because the company failed to adequately inform the FCC of allegedly improper campaign contributions and foreign payments.  According to the Gabelli filing, the group\\'s most recent GenCorp stock transactions included purchases of 482,000 common shares Jan. 12 through March 5 at $71 to $87 each and sales of 89,556 shares Jan. 26 through March 17 at $71 to $89.636 each.

       " 'WSJ870320-0100': '--- A Lingering Stigma: Divorce Might Not Halt the Climb, But It Still Raises Eyebrows --- By Cynthia Crossen</HL> Back when divorce was shameful, corporate America joined the rest of society in labeling men with broken marriages as failures. For them, there was no room at the top.  Over time, divorce has seeped into every stratum of American life, and now most people assume that it no longer carries a stigma. But in America\\'s executive suites, some of the stigma lingers.  A superbly qualified man probably wouldn\\'t be denied a top job because of his marital status. But a divorce won\\'t go unnoticed. To his superiors, it will be a subject of concern and curiosity; they\\'ll want to know how he handled it and how, if he hasn\\'t remarried, he\\'s handling his new status. Though divorce is deeply personal, when it happens to a corporate executive, other people make it their business.  Among senior executives of major corporations, divorce is still far from common. A survey by The Wall Street Journal found that the typical chief executive officer of a Fortune 500-level company is a 58-year-old man married to a woman who doesn\\'t work outside the home. And typically, he has been married to the same woman for more than 20 years. All 351 of the respondents in the survey were men, and only 3.4% of them were divorced. Of those who were married, only 18% had been married more than once.  The marital picture for women executives is quite different. According to a recent report by Heidrick &amp; Struggles Inc., an executive search firm, more than 40% of female corporate executives are single, separated or divorced. Among executives, a man without family is an anomaly, but a woman without family is normal.  Age helps explain the low divorce rate among senior corporate men. Most are older than 45 and thus belong to generations that have a relatively low incidence of divorce. But a debate simmers about why executive men seem to divorce even less than average.  Some believe that men who succeed in the business world are a breed apart, able to cope with their personal lives as maturely as they do their business problems. \"My bias is that the person who becomes a CEO is a remarkable, unusual guy who has risen above many hazards and problems along the way,\" says Richard Diedrich, manager of the Boston office of Rohrer, Hibler &amp; Replogle, a corporate psychology group. \"He stands above the group in terms of general psychological health.\"  Others theorize that corporate executives may be so driven by their work that even if their home lives are wretched, they simply can\\'t be bothered to get a divorce. \"Guys on the fast track go full bore on their jobs and don\\'t have time to get a divorce,\" says David Peasback, president of Heidrick &amp; Struggles. \"They\\'re busy, active people who can tolerate what other people might not.\"  A third group wonders whether executive men, like politicians, still feel their careers are more likely to flourish if they paint a pretty picture of their home lives. Twenty years ago, the perfect family facade was crucial. \"We all knew people who weren\\'t happy but stayed married because they didn\\'t want a divorce,\" says Harding Lawrence, former chief executive of Braniff Airlines, who divorced and remarried in the middle of his career.  The topic of divorce still seems to make many senior executives uncomfortable. To follow up its recent survey, The Wall Street Journal telephoned more than a dozen chief executives who have been divorced. All declined to be interviewed. Asked why his boss didn\\'t want to be quoted on the subject, one executive\\'s assistant said, \"He feels he is a symbol of this company, and he doesn\\'t want this company associated in people\\'s minds with divorce.\"  Although that pressure may be subtler now, some people argue that it still exists. \"There\\'s definitely an unspoken pressure to keep a marriage together,\" says Patricia Cook, principal at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm. \"The pressure says if you want to be CEO, you have to demonstrate that you\\'re not an ordinary man and not subject to the same vulnerabilities as the rest of the population. You have to be Mr. Perfect.\"  That\\'s a tall order. From the wife\\'s viewpoint, strains are inherent in this kind of marriage. As a rule, the amount of time the husband spends with his wife and family is severely limited. The husband believes he has to make big sacrifices in his personal and family life to succeed in his career, so he makes them. Sometimes the sacrifices become excessive, and the marriage is jeopardized.  \"My husband usually arrives home exhausted and detached,\" complains the wife of a Fortune 500 chief executive who has contemplated divorce. \"Invariably, when a crisis occurs at home, he is hundreds of miles away and preoccupied.\" Another discontented wife says: \"We participate in activities to enhance his career. I direct my life according to his needs.\"  When a corporation frowns on divorce, it usually has less to do with the industry or region of the country than with the man at the helm.  Mr. Diedrich remembers the president of a company looking for a successor and considering four or five logical contenders, one of whom was on the threshold of divorce. \"The president\\'s attitude was, \\'I\\'m not sure I want to turn my company over to him,\\'\" Mr. Diedrich says. \"But really he was saying, \\'This position calls for interacting socially and politically with the community, and my successor needs an able lady at his side to enable him to do what I\\'ve done.\\' The president prided himself on having worked a balance between home and work, and if he could do it, so could other people.\"  Today, however, corporate chiefs have to be careful about expressing their prejudices openly. For one thing, in 20 states and the District of Columbia, it\\'s illegal to discriminate in hiring or promotions on the basis of marital status. But recruiters trying to place a senior executive at certain companies say they know without being told that candidates must fit in.  David Smith, managing director of the New York office of Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, tells of a search for a bank president. \"The client was very specific about almost everything, from religion to marital status. It\\'s not so much that they were against one or the other; it was more to fit into the community. They told us, \\'The person should have a wife, be a family man.\\'\"  Even so, the vast majority of recruiters and executives say divorce won\\'t make or break a job candidate anymore. Ralph Young, president of Amasco, an executive search firm based in Pittsburgh, says that when he got started in the business in 1964, \"We had clients small and large who simply told us they didn\\'t want a divorced man. Their feeling was, if a man can\\'t run his home life, he\\'s not capable of running our company.\" Today, he says, tolerance is much more widespread. \"We always specifically ask that question (about divorced candidates),\" he says, \"and the response isn\\'t negative at all.\"  That\\'s not to say a man\\'s divorce is irrelevant. \"It\\'s information I want to pass on to the client,\" Mr. Smith says. \"It\\'s information like how tall he is. It shouldn\\'t be the deciding factor, but it should help the client know the person.\"  At companies that prefer to promote from within, a man with marriage troubles who is already considered a valued employee is likely to be shown tolerance. Charles W. Sweet, vice president and partner of A.T. Kearney Inc., a Chicago-based executive search concern, recalls an officer in a large company who was granted an indefinite leave to work out his marital problems. \"Ten or 15 years ago,\" he says, \"the company wouldn\\'t have done anything for him.\"  It\\'s unlikely that the choice for top job would ever come down to two candidates identical in every way but marital status. But if it did, there\\'s little doubt which one would get it. \"Like in football, the good big man is better than the good little man,\" says Mr. Peasback. \"If you have two identical candidates, you\\'d probably take the one who isn\\'t divorced.\"  What\\'s more, not all divorces are equal. A company considering a divorced man for a top job would also want to know the details.  \"A recent divorce raises the spectre that at night, instead of going home to his wife and hearth, he\\'s going to go out to discos and stay out late, and his energy won\\'t be devoted to the company,\" Ms. Cook says.  A messy divorce is worse. \"If there\\'s some kind of scandal attached to it, or if another member of the organization has been dragged in because they\\'re in the same social circles, that will leave a residual distaste,\" says Harry Levinson, a psychologist and president of the Levinson Institute in Boston.  Undesirable as a recent or messy divorce can be, some companies regard men who cheat on their wives as even worse risks.  \"If a guy\\'s having an affair on the side and spending a lot of time figuring out how to meet the woman, he\\'ll be just as diverted from his work,\" Ms. Cook says. \"Also, there\\'s a much greater likelihood that there\\'s going to be a tinge in the company that he\\'s immoral and unethical, and if he\\'s that way in his personal life, maybe he\\'s that way in his business life.\"  But the real pariahs in business, the men who will find no less prejudice today than 20 years ago, are those who have never been married.  \"It\\'s not a natural thing for people to get past a certain age and not be married,\" says Bill Billington, chairman of Billington, Fox &amp; Ellis, executive recruitment consultants.  Ms. Cook says clients always want to know precisely why a candidate has never married. \"If it\\'s a male client, the question of gay will be in their minds,\" she says. \"And only after a face-to-face meeting can the client put that fear to rest. Most heterosexual men have a hard time dealing with gay men, and considering the closeness of the relationship between a chairman and a CEO, it would be tough to have the right chemistry between them if one was gay and one wasn\\'t.\"  (In the recent Wall Street Journal survey of 351 top executives, 66% said they would hesitate to promote someone who is homosexual to management-committee level.)  A few companies have overcome such apprehension and have begun recognizing the value of a man unencumbered by family. \"One of our clients was in the process of recruiting someone for a $1 million-plus job, and we asked about preferences,\" says Jacques Nordeman, chairman of Nordeman Grimm Inc., an executive search firm.  \"The client said since the person has to travel 70% of the time, it would be ideal if the candidate were divorced or single, didn\\'t have a family and could concentrate on the job 100% of the time.

James Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN> A series of lawsuits by former Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. employees have made the credit rating firm the subject of a local tabloid scandal.  The lawsuits were filed in federal district court in Chicago by workers who left the employee-owned firm before its shares were acquired in a buyout. The suits assert that Duff &amp; Phelps violated various securities laws in its handling of the buyout, which paid $2,000 a share. The suits ask that the departing employees, who had to sell their shares at a far lower price when they left the firm, be compensated for the difference.  The suits are in the news again because a Chicago federal appeals court this week ordered a jury trial for one of suits, which the lower court had dismissed.  The appellate court opinion by circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook recounts an embarrassing tale of how Duff &amp; Phelps\\'s former controller, Carol Franchik, was able to swing a different arrangement when she left the company.  According to the court opinion, Ms. Franchik was fired after the company\\'s board was told she was involved in an affair with Claire Hansen, Duff &amp; Phelps\\'s chairman. When Ms. Franchik threatened a sex-discrimination suit over the firing, the board agreed to make an exception to an existing company policy that departing employees must sell their shares back to the company, said a plaintiff\\'s attorney, James S. Gordon, who cited depositions by board members.  Ms. Franchik kept her 300 shares and later sold them for the full buyout price of $2,000 apiece, or a total of $600,000. The former employees who are suing sold their shares for less than $150 each.  Mr. Gordon, the attorney for plaintiff Paul Much, asserted in his opening argument that Ms. Franchik had access to inside information because of her alleged affair with Mr. Hansen. In testimony, Ms. Franchik acknowledged a personal relationship with her former boss. Mr. Hansen testified that he told directors he wasn\\'t having an affair.  Mr. Hansen declined to comment on the suits. Ms. Franchik couldn\\'t be reached.  The suits have drawn considerable attention in the Chicago business community. Ms. Franchik has appeared on the front pages of local newspapers wearing a fur coat with a turned up collar as she exited the courtroom. The publicity could build further with the appellate court\\'s decision.  The appeals court sent the suit of James S. Jordan, a former Duff &amp; Phelps analyst, back to the lower court for trial, saying that as a shareholder in a private company Mr. Jordan should have been privy to information Ms. Franchik apparently had. The lower court had said in granting summary judgment that the employer had no duty to inform Jordan about the buyout talks. There have been no court decisions on the other employee suits.  According to the appellate court opinion, Mr. Jordan quit the Chicago-based company in November 1983 and went to Houston because of tension between his wife and his mother, who also lived in Chicago. \"Our position is that Mr. Jordan would\\'ve never left when he did had he been told about the negotiations and the chance that he could\\'ve made more than $600,000 instead of $23,000,\" said Thomas Ward, his lawyer.  When Mr. Jordan left Duff &amp; Phelps, he owned 188 shares and was making installment payments on another 62. The appeals court apparently agreed with Mr. Ward and Mr. Jordan. \"Difficulties with a mother-in-law are a strain, but families bear strains greater than that for the prospect of financial gain,\" wrote Judge Easterbrook.

       " 'WSJ870320-0091': 'At Giving Up Any Of Texaco Award --- Company Moves to Reinstate $2 Billion Cut by Court From $11.1 Billion Total --- By Matt Moffett Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) </IN> Is $9.1 billion enough for Pennzoil Co.?  Last month, a Texas appeals court panel affirmed $9.1 billion of Pennzoil\\'s $11.1 billion judgment against Texaco Inc. The court\\'s only modification in the whopping award came in its reduction of punitive damages to $1 billion from $3 billion. The ruling was widely viewed as favorable to Pennzoil and the company at the time expressed \"delight\" and \"gratitude\" at the fact that the court upheld the overwhelming part of the award.  In a recent filing in the appeals court, however, Pennzoil asked the court to reinstate the full $3 billion in punitive damages. Pennzoil said its request was in part a formality that would preserve its right to the full award when Texaco appeals the judgment to the Texas Supreme Court. But Pennzoil also stated that it thinks it has a right to every penny of the original award it won when a jury found that Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil\\'s merger agreement with Getty Oil Co. when Texaco acquired Getty in 1984.  \"I\\'m not in the habit of giving away $2 billion,\" said Joe Jamail, Pennzoil\\'s chief counsel; \"$2 billion here, $2 billion thereafter a while it begins to add up.\"  Mr. Jamail said that even when the reduction of $2 billion in damages is taken into account, the judgment now totals $10.3 billion when the accrued interest is included.  But Texaco contends that by seeking to have the $2 billion reinstated, Pennzoil had signaled its refusal to comply with the appeals court ruling. And as a result of what it calls Pennzoil\\'s \"conditional compliance,\" Texaco has moved that the entire case should be retried in a lower court. \"Some states say you can\\'t have your cake and eat it too,\" said Russell McMains, a Texaco attorney who specializes in appellate procedures.  Texaco acknowledged that it was attacking on a highly technical point that isn\\'t clearly settled in Texas law. But the latest skirmish clearly indicates the intensity of the dispute between the two companies, with Pennzoil scrambling for every cent it can get, and Texaco pursuing every legal remedy it can muster.  \"We will plow every field,\" said Mr. McMains.  Lawyers not directly involved in the case also said that Texaco appeared to be taking a chance on a long shot. \"It sounds to me like the \\'grasp at any straw\\' approach to the situation, which is where Texaco is at this point in the case,\" said Frank W. Morgan, a lawyer here who formerly was associate general counsel for Gulf Corp., now a Chevron Corp. unit. \"It sounds highly technical.\"  Texaco\\'s latest legal attack is based upon the language buried on page 161 in the appellate panel\\'s opinion. The court conditioned the denial of Texaco\\'s motion for new trial upon Pennzoil\\'s agreement to voluntarily drop $2 billion in punitive damages from the judgment. Pennzoil at that point indicated it would readily comply with the appellate court ruling.  Pennzoil later filed a document called a remittitur in which it agreed to drop $2 billion -- but it also made known its reservations. In the document, Pennzoil said it reserved the right to seek a rehearing on the reduction in damages. Subsequently, Pennzoil filed a motion for rehearing of the punitive damages issue, contending that the court had \"erroneously applied the Texas law, and inappropriately embraced\" certain principles of New York law, which was also used in the case.  Pennzoil\\'s Mr. Jamail contended that Texaco\\'s latest move to have the judgment overturned was a sign of the company\\'s desperation. \"If they had a good case, they wouldn\\'t have to reach this deep into the barrel,\" said Mr. Jamail. \"It\\'s ludicrous.\"  Texaco acknowledged that its latest legal attack was out of the ordinary, but said that wasn\\'t surprising considering the high stakes involved in the case. \"Since there\\'s never been a judgment of this size before, I suspect that anything is unusual,\" said Mr. McMains.

       " 'WSJ870320-0089': 'Help for Workers Displaced by Imports --- By Monica Langley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The House Ways and Means Committee, continuing work on trade legislation, approved provisions to enhance benefits to workers displaced by imports and to provide new sanctions for U.S. firms against dumped or subsidized imports.  But the panel put off until next week consideration of more controversial proposals that would require retaliation against certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries and limit presidential discretion in resolving trade disputes.  And Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he was considering waiting until the legislation moves to the House floor before fighting for his highly charged amendment to force trade retaliation against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S.  The committee worked all day yesterday behind closed doors on a bill offered by its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). Rep. Rostenkowski\\'s proposal, which was approved by a Ways and Means subcommittee last week, is viewed as less protectionist than the legislation introduced earlier this year.  One provision approved by the committee yesterday would increase retraining benefits for workers whose jobs are lost because of imports. It also would set up a voucher system for payment of these benefits.  The committee toughened provisions for dealing with foreign companies that repeatedly \"dump\" goods -- or sell them at unfairly low prices -- in the U.S. It provided for expedited action on dumping complaints against foreign companies and took steps to make it easier for U.S. companies to bring civil suits against foreign manufacturers. The panel voted to drop a proposal to establish criminal penalties for dumping violations, however.  The panel also voted to give the Commerce Department new powers to prevent firms from circumventing anti-dumping orders by shipping their products in parts or through a third country.  The committee voted to transfer the authority to determine whether an industry is entitled to protection from imports to the U.S. trade representative from the president. Some lawmakers believe that the trade representative would be more inclined than the president to rule that an industry is being hurt by imports. Such an injury finding can trigger the imposition of tariffs or quotas on the imports.  Under the panel\\'s bill, an import-battered industry would be required to devise a plan to return to competitiveness before it could receive such import relief. But even dying industries could qualify. The Reagan administration has argued that an industry should be required to demonstrate that it can survive before it can receive such protection.  Rep. Gephardt, a presidential candidate, told reporters yesterday that he was determined to push for his amendment, which is designed to force such countries as Japan to reduce their large trade surpluses with the U.S. Rep. Rostenkowski\\'s proposed bill significantly watered down the proposal. It simply would require the administration to negotiate with the other country, rather than forcing the president to retaliate immediately.  \"My concern with that approach is that it doesn\\'t give a standard of accountability,\" Rep. Gephardt said. \"I still think I can pass this amendment on the House floor.\"  Meanwhile, a House banking subcommittee approved legislation forbidding foreign firms from becoming primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments give U.S. companies the same right in their countries.

John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wants to tighten the rule that investors disclose stock holdings of 5% or more and to lengthen the tender offer period.  The proposals will be part of legislation the Michigan Democrat plans to introduce in the wake of Wall Street\\'s insider-trading scandal. Speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Rep. Dingell said he will soon introduce separate bills addressing insider-trading problems and the general issue of mergers and acquisitions. Similar legislation is being drafted in the Senate.  \"Clearly the amount of stock that triggers disclosure is far too high,\" Rep. Dingell said. He didn\\'t specify the threshold that will be in his legislative package. Currently, an investor is required to report holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission after acquiring 5% or more of a company\\'s stock.  The powerful committee chairman also plans to include a provision to extend the tender offer period from the current 20 business days, but he didn\\'t specify how long a period he would seek. \"My intention is to increase the time a company has to defend itself,\" he said.  Rep. Dingell expressed concern about the \"Chinese walls\" that are supposed to separate investment banking firms\\' risk-arbitrage and mergers-and-acquisitions departments. \"One of the things we\\'ll look at is to see that the Chinese wall works or those on either side will go their separate ways,\" he said.  But Dingell aides said the lawmaker probably wouldn\\'t consider legislation on the matter until his committee\\'s oversight panel completes its probe of insider-trading abuses, including apparent cracks in the \"Chinese walls\" of some investment banking firms.  Rep. Dingell reiterated his intention to shorten the period before investors must disclose to the SEC stakes of 5% or more. The current 10-day period often allows raiders to make sneak attacks, and it allows unfounded rumors about hostile bids to build. SEC Chairman John Shad also has said he favors shortening the 10-day period.  On separate legislation directed at insider trading rather than acquisitions generally, Rep. Dingell said his goal is \"to require more careful and attentive supervision\" of employees at securities firms. And he said he supported giving the SEC greater resources. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0086': '--- Living on $400,000: Four Chief Executives Give a Peek At How They Spend What They Reap --- By John R. Emshwiller Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Chief executives routinely deal with millions of dollars of other people\\'s money. But how do they deal with their own?  A glimpse of how top executives handle their personal pocketbooks is offered in interviews with the heads of four companies: James A. Cook of Porsche Cars North America Inc., John P. Imlay Jr. of Management Science America Inc., Joel B. Leff of Forstmann Leff Associates Inc. and John C. Merritt of Van Kampen Merritt Inc.  These men earn salaries of $200,000 to $400,000 a year, exclusive of any bonuses. As a condition of discussing their personal finances, however, they asked that details of their earnings and their spending habits be kept confidential.  There are striking similarities in the way these executives run their financial lives. One is an aversion to plastic. All maintained that, even before they became successful and wealthy, they paid cash for purchases, or else paid credit-card balances in full each month to avoid interest.  Each also has an accountant and some have other financial advisers, but none uses a financial planner. Most said that they had made it a habit to save regularly, even before a fat paycheck made saving a relatively easy task.  \"I\\'m much more professional about what I do for Porsche than about what I do for myself,\" says Mr. Cook, CEO of Porsche Cars North America in Reno, Nev.  His company is 100%-owned by Porsche AG, the European car maker, which in turn is largely family owned. So Mr. Cook, 59 years old, holds no stock in his own employer. He does own other securities ranging from speculative penny stocks to more middle-of-the-road equities.  But he prefers to invest mainly in \"things that I don\\'t need to look at every day.\" Buying individual stocks makes him nervous because \"if I go to Europe for two weeks, things can happen.\"  In the past, he has favored real estate, mainly as a partner in apartment and hotel ventures. In light of the new tax law\\'s harsher treatment of most real estate investments, he says, \"I\\'ll be phasing that out.\" He expects to increase his holdings of mutual funds and to maintain, but perhaps scale back, his sizable portfolio of municipal bonds.  Mr. Cook and his wife (both of whom were previously married) have seven children. When the kids reached driving age and wanted cars, Mr. Cook at first insisted that they should pay half the cost of a car. The result was that the cars purchased were \"junkers.\"  Later on, Mr. Cook says, he relented and decided to buy his children \"decent cars.\" (The autos aren\\'t Porsches, however.) He still requires the children to pay for their own gasoline and insurance. \"Some people would say, \\'Gee, you can afford to do that for your kids.\\' Well, I guess we could. But this is one way to teach them responsibility.\"  For financial advice, Mr. Cook turns to the accountant who has served him for many years, and who is soon to become a lawyer as well. That takes some doing, since the accountant is in Houston (where Mr. Cook used to live) and Mr. Cook is in Reno. \"We started out together,\" Mr. Cook explains, \"and he\\'s done a good job.\"  John Imlay is chief executive of Management Science America, an Atlanta-based software and data-processing firm he took public in 1981. Most of his net worth consists of stock in his own company, but he has other investments.  An array of tax-free bonds is the core of this portfolio. Then there\\'s timberland and farmland, mostly in Georgia. \"I go walk the land\" before buying, Mr. Imlay says. \"I don\\'t care how excited (the sales people) are. When you sink into it up to your knees, you know how good it is.\"  Mr. Imlay, 50, also owns stock in other companies. \"I invest in people,\" he says. Many of his stocks were chosen because he was impressed with a company\\'s executives during business dealings.  Ever since he made $300 a month as an office-form sales trainee fresh out of school, Mr. Imlay says, he has followed the \"sage advice\" of his father and invested 10% of his gross income. His capsule version of his dad\\'s advice: \"Put down the alligator shoes and invest the money.\"  Like his father, he pays cash for most purchases. He disdains credit cards but uses a debit card occasionally.  In addition to a checking account and a cash management account with a brokerage firm, he still has a passbook savings account. Asked why, he says he\\'s never gotten around to closing it. \"It\\'s so small it didn\\'t make any difference.\"  Mr. Imlay used to use a financial planner, but decided he didn\\'t need one since \"I was making the decisions anyway.\" He relies on his own tax adviser, who is also the company\\'s secretary-treasurer.  Joel Leff is co-chairman of the New York-based money-management firm, Forstmann Leff Associates, a subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group PLC. He likes to tell the story about a Wellesley College 20-year reunion.  One woman, the story goes, showed up in a provocative red dress, high heels and cigarette holder. Picking up clues to a disreputable vocation, her classmates asked her what had happened. \"It was either that,\" said the woman, \"or dip into capital.\"  Mr. Leff, 51, professes a strong dislike for dipping into capital, and says he has done it only once, during the horrendous market of 1974. Recently married for the third time, he says he found it somewhat easier to control household expenditures during the years when he was on his own. He and his wife take turns paying the bills.  A \"very conservative\" investor, Mr. Leff says he keeps much of his money in municipal bonds rated double-A or higher. A smaller amount is in stocks, he says, because \"I just don\\'t do it as well for myself as I have for clients. I get too emotionally involved.\"  He says his favorite investment has always been real estate, mainly commercial buildings, often with a historical-renovation aspect (and tax advantage) to the deal. Despite the new tax law, he expects to keep investing in real estate, but will demand a higher anticipated rate of return before entering any deal.  He also invests in art, antique furniture, and gold coins. Gold, he says, is \"traditional and feels nice. It weighs more than 100 shares of IBM.\"  For financial advice and record keeping, Mr. Leff says he has \"enough henchmen,\" including an accountant, a tax attorney, and a full-time personal bookkeeper.  As CEO of Van Kampen Merritt, the Lyle, Ill.-based investment banking subsidiary of Xerox Corp. and a leading packager of municipal bond unit trusts, Jack Merritt hardly needs an allowance. When he was a youth, however, his father kept him on a strict one.  \"In my senior year of high school, my father put me on an annual salary and made me get my own checking account,\" the 46-year-old Mr. Merritt says. That arrangement continued into college. \"I had to go out and work. I ran a laundry business and raked leaves,\" he recalls.  He\\'s making similar demands of his own children. \"It\\'s very important to learn to live within your means.\"  To manage his money these days, Mr. Merritt, who is based in Philadelphia, gets some help. He uses several brokers, and likes to \"give them some discretion.\" He prefers bonds to stocks, avoids commodities, and likes real estate. He is, not surprisingly, partial to mutual funds and unit investment trusts. \"If you\\'re running a firm, I don\\'t feel you have time to mastermind your investments,\" he says.  In addition to several checking accounts and a money market fund, he still keeps an old-fashioned savings account. The reason? \"To be fair to the bank,\" Mr. Merritt says. In exchange for good banking service, he feels it\\'s only reasonable to allow the bank a dollop of low-cost funds.  \"I believe generally in working with one major supplier,\" he says. \"They\\'re entitled to get some compensation back for their service, provided they\\'re offering good service.\"  --- Mr. Dorfman reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal\\'s New York Bureau.  ---  Where a CEO\\'s Salary Goes What a typical top corporate executive might do with an annual income of $400,000 Income Gross income                         $400,000 Taxes                                 134,000 Net income                           $266,000 Personal spending Shelter                               $27,000 Food                                   10,000 Clothing                                8,000 College tuition                        15,000 Auto                                    7,000 Health and disability insurance         2,000 Uninsured medical expenses              1,000 Principal and interest on loans         5,000 Life insurance                          2,000 Charity                                10,000 Gifts                                   6,000 Country Club                            3,000 Vacation and recreation                30,000 Miscellaneous                          10,000 Total personal spending              $136,000 Savings and investments Bank deposits                           6,000 Company retirement plan                 7,000 IRA                                     2,000 Foreign securities                      6,000 Real estate                            33,000 Gold                                    2,000 Municipal bonds                        25,000 Corporate bonds                        14,000 Stocks                                 35,000 Total savings and investments        $130,000 Source: Ayco Corp., Wall Street Journal estimates ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0085': 'Staff to Lower Costs And Lift Productivity</HL> Mellon Bank Corp., the nation\\'s 12th largest banking concern, said it will reduce its work force in an effort to cut costs and boost productivity.  The bank holding company declined to estimate the extent of the staff cuts. It said in a prepared statement that the cuts are a result of an ongoing internal study of the concern and its staffing levels. Mellon said the review will be completed \"over the next several weeks.\"  The company has been troubled by a growing number of nonperforming foreign and energy loans. In addition, its expenses have grown at a faster pace than those of banks of comparable size. In 1986, Mellon\\'s earnings fell 9.1% to $183.3 million, or $6.20 a share, from $201.7 million, or $7.13 a share, in 1985.  At the end of 1986, Mellon had 18,419 employees, with 8,800 in its corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh. Mellon took a fourth-quarter charge of $9 million to restructure its foreign lending operation, including closing several offices and laying off or transferring workers.  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mellon closed at $55.375 a share, down 50 cents. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0084': '--- The Frill Is Gone: For the Modern-Day CEO, the Maxim For Office Design Is: Keep It Spare --- By Meg Cox</HL> The \"power\" office is out. For the lean, mean \\'80s, a chief executive officer can still have good furniture and some appreciating art on the walls, but the bottom line is function.  How times have changed. In the early \\'50s, when Elliott White Springs built a headquarters for his textile company in Fort Mill, S.C., he wanted it to be the most modern building in the world, and his office was a high-tech wonder. With a touch of a button, the chief executive of Springs Industries Inc. could elevate a portion of the walnut parquet floor until it became a conference table. Other buttons on his desk opened and closed the 120 feet of draperies; turned on the television, radio or movie projector; activated the security system; operated the lights; and vibrated Mr. Springs\\'s chair.  Springs\\'s current chief executive, Walter Y. Elisha, prefers a different office, about half the size and without gadgetry. His reasons for occupying more modest quarters have little to do with the fact that his company is now public, as opposed to Mr. Springs\\'s era. \"I find the less elaborate, more functional office better suited to my style,\" Mr. Elisha says.  Mr. Elisha\\'s inclinations reflect a general trend in recent years away from lavish, grandiose offices for chief executives.  \"Chief executives consider what they do in their offices rather than just the looks of them. They want to make it clear they are working executives, not just figureheads,\" says William Drake, a partner at the architectural firm Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill in Chicago. \"There used to be much more ceremony involved in entering the CEO\\'s office. You walked 20 feet to the grand, old man, behind this huge mahogany desk empty of papers. That\\'s a thing of the past.\"  Top executives don\\'t want to blend completely into the paneling: they still prefer large, corner offices and such traditional trappings as private bathrooms. But, in general, they don\\'t want to seem either intimidating or overly opulent. Communication (with employees) and accountability (to shareholders) are the buzzwords. In these takeover times, a too-lavish office just might signal a bloodthirsty raider that there\\'s a profitable opportunity to trim corporate fat.  \"Some clients do want a palace. But heads of public companies mostly tell us they don\\'t want the office so nice that people walk in and think, \\'Aha! This is where all the money is going,\\'\" says Karen Myers, president of Interior Design Development in Costa Mesa, Calif. The new headquarters of American Express Co. in New York\\'s World Financial Center is quite grand, and Chairman James D. Robinson III\\'s paneled office boasts an inlaid marble table, antiques and an Oriental rug. But decorator Robert Metzger remembers Mr. Robinson saying over and over, \"This item costs too much. Find something else.\"  Indeed, big offices may be one factor that spurred raider T. Boone Pickens Jr.\\'s move against Diamond Shamrock Corp. Former Chief Executive William H. Bricker enjoyed lavish perks that included several corporate jets. His office in the company\\'s Dallas headquarters is said to be enormous. A Diamond Shamrock spokesman says, \"The offices are quite comfortable but there are no extraordinary appointments or architectural features.\"  As for Mr. Pickens\\'s own office at Mesa Limited Partnership in Amarillo, Texas, \"We practice what we preach,\" he says. \"I have a good, workable, functional desk and a computer. There are three western paintings on the wall, but two of them are for sale because they\\'ve appreciated in value. My office is about 20 feet by 18 feet, and I\\'ve had the same office on the fifth floor of a 10-story building for 20 years.\"  There are plenty of other leaders setting a no-frills example: The Silicon Valley aesthetic remains spare. Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corp. in 1968 and currently its chief executive, still occupies a standard issue, metal and plastic desk in a cubicle whose walls are no higher than anyone else\\'s. He has a special chair, a spokesman says, \"but that\\'s because he has a bad back.\"  In New York\\'s financial community, where lavish offices are the standard, John Gutfruend of Salomon Brothers Inc. spends much of his workday at a semicircular wooden desk on the trading floor. Nearby is a large, private office to which he retreats for meetings.  Martin S. Davis, the chairman of Gulf &amp; Western Inc., says, \"Everything in my office has got a purpose. There are enough chairs for people to meet in and enough tables to work on. Most of the furniture, including my antique desk, is my own and I\\'ve had it for years. It\\'s a workspace: that\\'s what I\\'m about. It\\'s not an entertainment hall.\"  Some executives who inherited large, imposing offices from an earlier era have taken great pains to make them cosier. John J. Creedon, president and chief executive of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., moved into a 22-foot by 34-foot office of 13-foot high walnut paneling four years ago. \"It\\'s a lot more than I need, and if I were to build one it wouldn\\'t be this big,\" Mr. Creedon says.  Rather than greet visitors from behind his huge desk, Mr. Creedon prefers to sit in an armchair near a large, comfortable couch. Seated nearby is one of his two plush, business-suit-clad Snoopy dolls. (Snoopy appears in commercials for the insurance company.) \"When I\\'m sitting behind my desk, it might intimidate people,\" Mr. Creedon says. \"Here, we can sit with Snoopy, get comfortable, and maybe people will relax.\"  G. Robert Truex Jr., chairman of Rainier Bancorp. in Seattle, describes his office as \"traditional, handsome and over-large, which makes me uneasy. I\\'m not a high-powered guy and I don\\'t pretend I am.\"  Mr. Truex encourages people to relax from the moment they arrive at his door, walking across a \"Beware of Owner\" doormat. Inside his office, visitors find an array of music boxes and a vast collection of wind-up toys on the bookcases and credenza. Peeping out between the leaves of a potted palm is a plush gorilla in a red T-shirt and a paper crown. \"I\\'ve been known to say that he makes the big decisions around here,\" says Mr. Truex, who hastens to add: \"Please don\\'t get the impression that because I have these toys that I come to work in a clown hat. We conduct business here.\"  For all the plush menagerie, tradition nonetheless remains one of the bywords in executive offices, both in furnishings and decorative mementoes, which are meant to convey a sense of stability and longevity. Donald Frey, chairman of Bell &amp; Howell Co. of Chicago, moved his company to a modern building in 1985, but in his office he sits at the rolltop desk once used by the company\\'s founder, Albert S. Howell. His telephone is Mr. Howell\\'s 1919 brass candlestick phone, which has been electronically refurbished.  \"In the last three years or so, there has been a return to more conservative environments,\" says Beverly Russell, editor of Interiors magazine. \"Inside many ultramodern skyscrapers rising 50 floors, the chairman\\'s office looks like Monticello.\"  Indeed, the look of paneled walls, Oriental rugs and antique wood desks has become so prevalent that some chairmen have rebelled in an effort to stand out, and to send a message of distinctiveness.  \"We have a new and creative company but we also want to convey solidity, because we guarantee billions of dollars of debt,\" says Gerald Friedman, chairman and founder of FGIC Corp., which insures municipal bonds. FGIC\\'s offices aren\\'t quite like anything else in Manhattan\\'s financial district: sleek and modern, with black marble tables, black lacquer desks and decorative curtain-like cascades of white silk strings from floor to ceiling.  Not surprisingly, there are still executives who love their perks and power offices. George Wackenhut of Wackenhut Corp. in Coral Gables, Fla., a big firm in the security guard field, isn\\'t the only chief executive with a barber chair in his private bathroom, so his barber can come to him. In Houston, a city of impressive offices, it\\'s hard to forget that of J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman of Pennzoil Co., who sits at the head of a 16-foot long desk made of planks from a shipwreck. Behind the desk in a large display case is his rock collection, including geodes the size of basketballs.  In the name of intimidation, who could better the tactic of a chief executive who asked one design firm to install very bright, adjustable lights above the chairs across from his desk? The designer, who won\\'t divulge his client\\'s name, says: \"The CEO could really make a guy sweat.\"  --- Ms. Cox reports on arts and entertainment from The Wall Street Journal\\'s New York bureau.

       " 'WSJ870320-0083': 'Sullies the Innovative Firm He Founded --- This article was prepared by Michael Cieply and John R. Emshwiller in Los Angeles, And Michael W. Miller in New York</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> Boyd L. Jefferies helped change the rules of the securities game. But by breaking them, he has damaged the reputation of what is probably the most innovative and aggressive stock-trading firm outside of Wall Street.  The question now is how deep and lasting the damage will be.  Jefferies Group Inc., the 445-employee brokerage holding company of which Mr. Jefferies was chairman and chief executive officer, was stunned by his early morning announcement that he planned to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities laws and that he was resigning. After Mr. Jefferies\\'s personal announcement to those employees over a national telephone hookup following its normal 4:50 a.m. PST planning meeting, the brokerage firm locked the elevators at its Los Angeles headquarters for a time.  Within hours, the company\\'s new chief executive, Frank Baxter, was taking calls, forcefully arguing that Jefferies would survive and prosper. \"They call this Jefferies Group for a reason,\" said Mr. Baxter, a 13-year veteran with the company. \"We have 190 professionals with personal client relationships.\" The chairman\\'s post remained vacant.  Despite yesterday\\'s travails, he added, \"it was a good day businesswise. Our clients really came through for us.\"  Jefferies is by far the biggest trader in the so-called \"third market,\" in which listed stocks are traded without going through an exchange. Such trading has grown rapidly with the bull market, and as big shareholders looked for fast and discreet ways to profit from the increasingly volatile world securities market.  Jefferies, a company Mr. Jefferies founded 25 years ago, in 1986 accounted for about 3% of the composite volume of all securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Last January, the company traded about 2% of the Big Board composite trading volume, or 164 million shares, for clients that have ranged from pension funds and individual shareholders to major Wall Street arbitragers. Jefferies makes up about 60% of the entire third market.  Mr. Baxter, 50 years old, who has been president and chief operating officer of Jefferies, said the January percentage was lower than last year only because the exchanges did extraordinarily heavy volume during the month.  Mr. Jefferies, 56, publicly denied that he had engaged in insider trading when he was subpoenaed last year in the government\\'s broad investigation of the securities business. Part of a clubby network of major players in the stock market, however, he succumbed to the temptation to swap illegal favors with some clients, including arbitrager Ivan Boesky. \"Boyd has always wanted to accommodate clients,\" said Mr. Baxter.  Mr. Jefferies declined to be interviewed. In a statement, he said: \"Something went wrong in our value systems and it is vital that we all learn from my mistakes and those of others.\"  Mr. Jefferies has been a spirited trader who seemed more at home on his company\\'s trading desks than its executive offices. His workday started as early as 3 a.m., and often ended late -- though Mr. Baxter said trades attributable to Mr. Jefferies have accounted for less than 5% of the company\\'s volume in recent years.  Mr. Jefferies had a large following among takeover investors, who relied on him to assemble large blocks of stock during corporate battles. Raiders liked trading with Mr. Jefferies because he moved unusually quickly and secretly and had a big network of contacts among arbitragers and other speculators in takeover stocks.  \"You felt like Jefferies\\'s trades had to go through less layers of people,\" said Harold Simmons, a Dallas financier who often traded through Mr. Jefferies. \"He could move without disturbing a lot of people, and the fewer people who know about these things the better.\"  Like many people, Mr. Simmons described Mr. Jefferies as a driven, intense worker. \"He was always at his desk. You could always reach him; he worked very long hours,\" Mr. Simmons said. He recalled that Mr. Jefferies tracked him down in the middle of a tennis game to try to negotiate the sale of a large block of NL Industries Inc. stock last summer, when Mr. Simmons was seeking control of NL. Mrs. Simmons staved Mr. Jefferies off until her husband finished his game.  Some people think Mr. Jefferies\\'s suspension will be a blow to the firm. Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. in New York, estimated that more than one-third of the firm\\'s business is directly attributable to Mr. Jefferies\\'s contacts with wealthy investors and institutions.  Mr. Long, a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Jefferies, described the trader as exceptionally intense. \"Some people are compulsive drinkers or compulsive woman-chasers. Boyd was a compulsive trader,\" he said. \"Whenever I sat with him at his offices -- which had glass windows so he could look out at the trading room -- you could sense he\\'d like the conversation to end as quickly as possible so he could get back onto the trading desk.\"  In the 1960s, there were many dealers in the third market, where trades were often made for lower commissions than exchange members charged. When commissions were later deregulated, many firms dropped out of the business.  \"They were survivors,\" one Los Angeles broker said yesterday of the Jefferies firm. Mr. Jefferies actually sold the company in 1969 to Investors Diversified Services Inc., now a unit of American Express Co., for $44.2 million. But he bought it back four years later -- for less than half that price, according to associates -- and then took the company public in 1983.  Over the past decade, two important trends expanded Jefferies\\'s business: the growing internationalization of markets and the rise of the takeover business. Suddenly, a firm that could make difficult block trades efficiently at unusual hours was in an enviable position.  Mr. Jefferies \"gained a world-wide institutional following,\" said Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which regulates the over-the-counter industry, of which Jefferies was a part.  Mr. Jefferies became celebrated for virtuoso trading feats. In December 1982, during a sudden halt in Big Board trading in Warner Communications Inc., Jefferies &amp; Co., Jefferies Group\\'s brokerage unit, made an almost exclusive market in Warner shares for about a day. Working round the clock with traders in Australia, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Switzerland and other places, the firm traded 3.5 million shares in two days. The message wasn\\'t lost on the Big Board, which soon opened a vigorous public-relations campaign against off-board trading, and Jefferies in particular.  More recently there has been speculation that Jefferies might again be sold. American Can Co. began acquiring Jefferies stock in 1985, and it currently has the equivalent of a 20% stake in the firm. Yesterday, an American Can spokesman described his company\\'s holding as a \"passive investment.\"  Mr. Jefferies controls about 13% of the company, but his interest will be placed in a voting trust for at least the next five years, during which Mr. Jefferies will be barred from the securities business under a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  \"I\\'d be incredibly surprised if he isn\\'t back in the business someday,\" said Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, a friend and business associate of Mr. Jefferies. From what he had heard about the violations, they seemed \"more technical than criminal,\" Mr. Jacobs said. Half joking, he added: \"You and I get a parking violation, and we get a $3 ticket.\"  Until last year, Mr. Jefferies lived in a huge oceanside house -- later sold for a reported $8.3 million -- that had a circular bed that rotated 360 degrees to take advantage of the view. He has given heavily to the arts, and has two galleries named for him in a Laguna Beach, Calif., museum.  A spokesman said Mr. Jefferies currently lives in the Palm Springs area, about 100 miles from Los Angeles. The executive has commuted to work almost every day, leaving his home at 1:30 a.m. in a chauffeur-driven limousine, according to the spokesman.  After attending college at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Jefferies went to work as a cattle manager at a family-owned ranch in Arizona. He got his start in the securities business with a small brokerage firm in 1956.  Secrecy has been a major attraction of third-market firms. Jefferies has routinely identified clients only by a number or letter code to protect their identity.  \"There is a legitimate confidentiality function. You never raise the curtain between client A and client B,\" said Wade Ambrose, vice chairman of Westlake Village, Calif.-based Jones &amp; Associates Inc., the third-largest trader in the third market. Referring to his competitor\\'s problems, Mr. Ambrose said, \"If anything, our business will be improved.\"  Despite publicity about Jefferies\\'s role in accumulating and trading stock during takeover battles -- often during periods when the exchanges have halted trading -- less than 10% of the company\\'s volume has come from takeover-related business, according to Mr. Baxter. He said Jefferies has diversified into areas such as convertible bonds and cash management for corporate clients.  Howard Marks, managing director of Trust Co. of the West, a Los Angeles investment manager, said his firm recently began using Jefferies in its trading of convertible debentures. \"This won\\'t affect our dealings with the firm. I can only believe this is an isolated instance and not pervasive in Jefferies,\" he added. ',\n",

The price wasn't disclosed.  Greyhound, a food and consumer products company that produces about 1,000 buses a year for intercity use, said it expects the transaction to be completed in July. The companies had announced the proposed sale of the GM bus making operations in January.

Greyhound said its agreement with GM includes the right to purchase the Canadian transit bus and parts business, contingent upon reaching a satisfactory labor agreement.

Separately, Greyhound said it completed the previously announced $350 million sale of its bus lines to a group of investors led by Dallas businessman Fred G.

       " 'WSJ870320-0081': '--- That\\'s No Hero, That\\'s a CEO: No Matter How Hard They Seem to Try, Business Execs Don\\'t Get Any Respect --- By John Huey</HL> Professional basketball players are thrilled to be elected to the NBA all-star team. Baseball players exult at inclusion in the Hall of Fame. So, how does Coca-Cola Co.\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, Roberto Goizueta, feel about being named Advertising Age\\'s 1986 Adman of the Year?  \"That\\'s the good news,\" he says. \"The bad news is that last year\\'s was Roger Smith (the beleaguered chairman of General Motors). The media made him a hero; now they\\'re making him a goat.\"  Perhaps the point is, as Mr. Smith told this newspaper recently: \"I wasn\\'t as good as they said I was two years ago, and I\\'m not as bad as they say I am now.\"  Or perhaps the point really should be to examine the very idea of chief executives as heroes: Are they or aren\\'t they? Should they or shouldn\\'t they be? If so, whose heroes should they be -- shareholders\\' or society\\'s -- and are the two mutually exclusive or compatible?  It\\'s difficult to put a finger on precisely when or exactly why this idea of the CEO as hero emerged. I mean, they rarely hit anything out of the park, you can\\'t dance to anything they do, and they certainly don\\'t risk their lives to save anybody. Somehow, though, I suspect Lee Iacocca is heavily mixed up in current thinking on the subject.  When Chrysler Corp. was down for the count, Mr. Iacocca took a page from the lives of Joe Namath and Muhammed Ali (both bona fide heroes), and went before Congress to stage the corporate equivalent of personally guaranteeing he would beat the Colts, while simultaneously taunting Sonny Liston. When Chrysler got up and staggered back to its corner to continue the fight, the modern chief executive hero was born. Forget that the turnaround at Ford Motor Co. is in many ways a more impressive business achievement; how many Americans can identify Donald Petersen?  It wouldn\\'t have worked, of course, if Mr. Iacocca were ugly or poorly spoken. This is truly the media age, a time when there is a place to print or a time to broadcast the most inconsequential doings of anyone remotely deemed to be a \"public\" person, as long as he has a little style. A friend, for example, recently suggested an idea for a nationally syndicated local cable TV show to be called \"Lifestyles of the Nouveau Riche and Not Famous Until Now.\" And I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see it catch on.  Not that Mr. Iacocca\\'s business achievements were without substance. But who could\\'ve foreseen that his coup would inspire some guy to buy an electric shaver company, invade our living rooms with commercials about how much he likes the shavers and then write a book starring himself as the CEO hero? Probably anyone who could\\'ve predicted that Vanna White would grace the cover of Newsweek.  Somewhere in all this, that question of style vs. substance looms large. Allen H. Neuharth, the chairman and former CEO who built Gannett Co. into a media giant, is often interviewed about how he shaped the company and how he created USA Today. But he\\'s also often asked why he only wears black and white and has black toilets in white bathrooms (he wears gray now in his eminence).  He says it\\'s just for convenience and to keep from mismatching socks and ties and such. But we don\\'t believe him, do we? This is a matter of style that one suspects he picked up from some role model (is there a little Hugh Hefner in this eccentricity?). And it leaves him open for detractors who can\\'t find anything wrong with his P/E ratio to say things like: \"You can\\'t tell where the sharkskin ends and Al begins.\"  Mr. Neuharth is one who relishes corporate heroism. He was thrilled to sit in George Washington\\'s church pew recently and receive the Poor Richard Club Gold Medal, placing him alongside the likes of Walt Disney, Dwight Eisenhower, Gen. David Sarnoff, William Paley, and, of course, Lee Iacocca.  Yet he concedes that many of his peers don\\'t share such feelings. \"Of the CEOs I know very well, the majority have been inclined to not want much public recognition,\" he says, perhaps because \"most surveys seem to indicate that the public doesn\\'t hold them (CEOs) in very high esteem.\" (Or is it because the currency of celebrity has been so incredibly debased?)  In any case, as Coke\\'s Mr. Goizueta notes, most people don\\'t have any idea what the substance of a CEO\\'s job is anyway.  \"Everyone wants to know \\'What are you going to buy next? What are you going to sell?,\\'\" he says. \"That\\'s what they think a CEO does today. The media like to focus on singular acts, like changing the (Coke) formula. This is a huge company to run. But if we tell them we\\'ve had a 25% compounded return since 1981 compared to the prior 10 years\\' return of less than 1%, they don\\'t care. It\\'s not sexy.\"  He\\'s right, of course, it\\'s not -- unless you\\'re a shareholder. And even then you\\'re more likely to think of the CEO as having done what you pay him enormously well to do, rather than as your hero.  Where it gets really confusing, though, is with the new breed of CEO/investment banker or \"asset player.\" It\\'s hard to embrace as heroes the folks who have made America\\'s corporate landscape \"more efficient on a yield basis\" by dismantling or gobbling up all manner of companies without regard to synergy, or even compatibility, much less such intangible concepts as employee loyalty. The sole goal and product of their effort is money. They don\\'t produce anything for society. They don\\'t run companies; they own them. Then they sell them and buy some more. And the marketplace confirms their belief that money conquers all.  But they do appear to be the \"heroes\" if not the soul of the future. Surveys at the nation\\'s elite business schools show that most future MBAs aspire to \"investment banking\" or \"mergers and acquisitions,\" as opposed to such mundane pursuits as \"manufacturing.\"  Now if you follow such things, think about this: What\\'s the difference in the way you feel after you learn that your favorite overpaid NBA power forward has been busted for crack, and the way you feel when a rich investment banker is handcuffed and hauled off to jail for insider trading? Personally, I\\'ll miss watching the forward\\'s turnaround slammajamma, and I\\'m disappointed that he\\'s so stupid. On the other hand, the shackling of the shark brings a smile to my face.  I suspect most of America agrees with me on this. And that\\'s why most CEOs just can\\'t be heroes even if they want to be. If they could, people would write country songs with titles like: \"Mamas don\\'t let your babies grow up to be CEOs.\"  --- Mr. Huey is The Wall Street Journal\\'s Atlanta bureau chief. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0079': '--- In Search of Pioneer Spirit: The Administration\\'s Critic of \\'Corpocracy\\' Now Wonders if We All Aren\\'t Turning Gray --- By Richard G. Darman</HL> A few months ago when I noted that some parts of America\\'s corporate establishment showed a tendency toward \"corpocracy,\" my remarks seemed to touch a nerve.  Many people, including many executives, expressed strong agreement. But, in some quarters, an immediate dfensive reaction was evident. What struck me most about this defensiveness was the apparent sense of outrage that the subject had even been raised. Denial of the legitimacy of raising the subject seemed in itself a regrettable symptom.  By the same token, my remarks needed to be put in a broader perspective. I certainly did not intend to criticize all of business. And, it would be unfair to suggest that our competitiveness problem should be blamed solely on weakness in part of the corporate culture. To some degree, the corporate culture is a reflection of the larger culture in which it resides. And problems in one suggest the likelihood of problems in the other.  It\\'s not simply that parts of corporate America seem to have turned a \"corpocratic\" gray. Sometimes America itself seems to be graying.  The idea of a graying America is hard to accept. America is meant to connote youthful vigor, romantic dreams, boundless opportunity, pioneering spirit. A graying America seems a contradiction in terms -- like Bruce Springsteen in a gray flannel suit.  Of course not all is turning to gray. Even in corporate culture, there are still colorful adventurers: Jobs, Pickens, and Perot, for example.  These are hardly dull conformists. (When I first met Steve Jobs, he had not yet become a media phenom. I mistakenly greeted one of his older, three-piece-suited associates as if he were the chairman of Apple Computer. It hadn\\'t occurred to me that the then-chairman would be the one in an open shirt, wearing what looked like a refined version of Mr. T\\'s neck chains.) But the very media attention that Jobs \"et al\" have received suggests that these flamboyant risk-takers are exceptions who prove a rule: Most corporate leadership is a rather conventional gray.  That is not necessarily a bad thing. An economy cannot afford to have everyone take high risks any more than a nation can have everyone explore new frontiers, or a football team can have everyone go out long.  But the question still presses itself upon us: Are we becoming a bit too gray -- losing our youthful energy and missionary vision as we age? Is our pioneering spirit flagging?  Clearly, the current interest in competitiveness suggests that there is some problem. Our huge current-account deficit has been a troubling symptom in the \\'80s. An even more troubling indicator is our comparative performance in productivity growth. It has been lagging since the \\'50s.  In the period 1950-1965, total U.S. business productivity grew at 3% a year. From 1965 to 1973, it grew at about 2%. And since 1973, it has grown at roughly 1%. But worse: Our manufacturing productivity has consistently grown more slowly than that of our major trading partners. From 1950 to 1985, ours grew at an average of 2.5% a year. Japan\\'s grew at 8.4%. Germany\\'s and Italy\\'s grew at 5.5%, France\\'s at 5.3% and Canada\\'s at 3.5%. Even much-maligned Britain surpassed us, growing at an average of 3.1%.  There has been an abundance of excuses and explanations. Excessive fiscal deficits, the run-up of the dollar, asymmetry in our openness to imports, the LDC debt crisis -- all these contributed to our trade deficit. The destruction of Europe\\'s and Japan\\'s capital stock in World War II -- and their associated opportunity to rebuild from scratch -- played a part in our productivity lag. So, too, did the rise of our service sector (with lower measured productivity growth than manufacturing), as did the widespread integration in the labor force of previously excluded and undertrained minorities and women.  But warmed-over excuses for cold statistics should not lead us to underrate what appears to be a long-term secular trend: In the post-war era, we have been losing our edge.  Yes, America has made remarkable advances. We have pioneered in areas ranging from biotechnology to the industrialization of space. In more conventional fields, corporate America has managed substantial restructuring. And the twin deficits, fiscal and trade, seem to be turning in the right direction.  Still, we should not delude ourselves into thinking that the troublesome long-term trend will easily be put behind us. Beyond Japan is Korea, along with other rising Asian economic powers. Beyond the trade deficit is competition in services -- as well as an increase in \"invisible\" returns to foreign owners of U.S. debt and equity. Beyond a decline in relative economic power is a likely cost in foreign policy. And if the productivity lag is not reversed, America may face an identity problem: As Presidents Kennedy and Reagan have argued, America is not meant to be second best.  The federal government has been conspicuously clumsy and misguided at times. But to reverse the long-term trend we must not only examine government policy, as Washington is now doing. We must also examine our curiously self-satisfied culture.  Clearly, the symptoms of \"corpocracy\" are not confined to business. Some of our most vital support systems seem to be weakening with age. Our basic educational system, for example, has become a giant \"mediocracy\", one of the world\\'s foremost manufacturers of the culturally and competitively mediocre.  We seem to have slipped into moral and intellectual complacency -- not just in some plush boardrooms, but generally. The work ethic is now rivaled by the leisure ethic, the consumption ethic and the \"I-can-have-it-all\" ethic. The Yuppie phenomenon is only the most visible outward sign of a pervasive and dull materialism -- unconnected with higher purpose, divorced from the idealistic tradition that sought to build a shining city upon a hill. It sometimes seems as if the rising stars of our commercial culture think Americans fought and died to make the world safe for wine coolers, the BMW, a year-end bonus and designer underwear.  Interdependence has risen. But we still tend to think of ourselves as protected by oceans, an isle unto ourselves. Comforted by our own rising standard of living, we have often forgotten to consider how our position is changing relative to other nations. But more basically: We have often lost sight of our higher standards, those that would expand the limits of human potential, and give meaning to our endeavors.  It is as if we were fading back into the gray self-satisfaction of the \\'50s. But the world has changed. To meet its challenges, we need to reawaken the spirit of America\\'s youth. Self-examination is a useful start. The trade deficit should do for us now what Sputnik did: infuse not just corporate culture, but the larger society, with renewed vigor and vision -- calling us again to our more vibrant colors.

       " 'WSJ870320-0076': 'Pound, Dollar Decline a Bit; Trading Is Quiet --- By Charles W. Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) </IN> The British pound\\'s rally paused, and the U.S. dollar also eased in quiet foreign exchange trading yesterday.  Trading was subdued by concern about possible central-bank intervention to prevent exchange rates for both the pound and dollar from venturing beyond the levels of recent dealings.  Anxiety about central-bank intrusion into currency markets is caused by last month\\'s exchange-rate stabilization agreement among the U.S. and its top five economic allies, traders said. Most major currencies have traded in a relatively narrow band since the accord by the Group of Six, or G-6, was announced in Paris Feb. 22.  \"Despite everyone\\'s expectations that the market would challenge the G-6\\'s supposed ranges of tolerance, the test of their resolve isn\\'t any closer than it was a month ago,\" said James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York.  While overall foreign-exchange activity was light yesterday, trading in sterling, and especially between sterling and West German marks, continued to dominate the market, dealers said.  \"The market is moribund. It\\'s difficult to see what\\'s going to shake the dollar out of the doldrums. The only action is in sterling and sterling-Deutsche mark,\" said Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell\\'Agricoltura in New York.  Sterling lost ground yesterday as it encountered relatively heavy corporate selling and traders who were reluctant to buy the currency for fear of intervention by the Bank of England. Concern about the central bank selling pounds was raised Wednesday after Britain\\'s chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, reiterated his opposition to further strengthening of the pound. \"Some people think the Bank of England is holding a sword over sterling, and that its potential is limited,\" Mr. Vick of Manufacturers Hanover said.  The pound was unaffected by the favorable news that Britain\\'s unemployment rate fell to 11.1% in February from 11.3% in January.  In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6003, down from $1.6080 Wednesday. Sterling also fell to 2.9338 marks, from 2.9513.  The dollar slipped to 1.8333 marks, from 1.8354, and to 151.48 Japanese yen, from 151.86.  The dollar\\'s uneventful dealings were due to a lack of consensus about U.S. economic growth prospects, compared to the rest of the industrialized world, as well as to worries about central bank intervention, traders said. \"You don\\'t have any major reason to go in either direction,\" said Francois Soares-Kemp, vice president and chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais in New York.  In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 151.35 yen from 151.48 yen in New York yesterday afternoon.  On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose 20 cents an ounce to $405.30 in light trading. The estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces.

       " 'WSJ870320-0073': 'Firm Spent Little on Exploration in \\'86 --- By Karen Blumenthal Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) </IN> Phillips Petroleum Co. said its global crude oil reserves fell 20% last year, while its overall energy reserves slid 6%.  Analysts say the declines are further indication that Phillips is liquidating at a faster rate than other major oil companies. Like most oil companies, Phillips invested relatively little in exploration last year because of low oil and gas prices.  The energy concern also is highly leveraged, with long-term debt of $5.76 billion at year\\'s end, and has been selling oil and gas properties to reduce its debt load.  \"It suggests to me that they are fighting an uphill battle and they are losing,\" says Sanford Margoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.  The disclosure of reserve data in the company\\'s annual report comes on the heels of active trading in Phillips\\'s stock that has pushed the stock price as high as $15.675 a share -- the highest level since early 1985.  Phillips has been the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange twice this week, with more than four million shares changing hands on both Tuesday and Wednesday. In composite trading, Phillips shares dropped 25 cents to close at $15.125 each on volume of 1.7 million shares.  Analysts attributed the stock activity to firmer oil prices and more confidence in the company\\'s future, but they cautioned that the company\\'s debt still makes it a relatively risky investment. \"I prefer other companies in the energy group,\" says Edith Barschi, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst.  The company said its U.S. oil reserves fell 24% during 1986. Its U.S. natural gas reserves declined 10%.  World-wide, however, Phillips\\'s gas reserves grew 5%, primarily because of revisions in reserves at the company\\'s Ekofisk field in Norway. As previously reported, the Norway reserves were reduced in 1985 because Phillips had to reinject natural gas into the field to keep it from subsiding. The amount of gas reinjected was reduced in 1986, allowing the company to again count the reserves.  The company\\'s global natural gas liquids reserves grew 13%, while its U.S. natural gas liquids reserves increased 28%.  Overall, Phillips reserves declined less than the 11% the company predicted last fall because of the adjustment to the Ekofisk field and because U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves were higher than initial evaluations indicated.

       " 'WSJ870320-0072': 'That Chrysler May Be Forced to Lift Bid --- By John Bussey Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> American Motors Corp.\\'s board is to meet again today amid investor speculation -- perhaps optimistic -- that Chrysler Corp. may be pressured to sweeten its $4-a-share bid for the company.  Chrysler last week agreed to acquire from Regie Nationale des Usines Renault its 46.1% stake in ailing AMC, and proposed to buy the rest of AMC in a stock swap valued at $4 a share. The total transaction, which includes Chrysler stock, bonds and cash, is valued at as much as $1.11 billion.  Yet AMC\\'s stock, which had been trading around $3.50 a share, immediately jumped above $4 on news of the proposal and has stubbornly stayed there on heavy volume. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AMC shares closed at $4.375, up 12.5 cents, and Chrysler shares closed at $53.50, down 12.5 cents, both in light trading.  \"What the market seems to be saying is that American Motors may hold out for a higher price from Chrysler\" for public shareholders, said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The board isn\\'t overwhelmed by the Chrysler offer.\"  Nor are some Wall Street traders, some of whom believe Renault is getting a better deal than other AMC shareholders. \"You might see another dollar\" added to Chrysler\\'s per-share offer, one arbitrager contended, saying his firm took a position in AMC after it topped $4 a share. Another arbitrager said her firm bought 200,000 shares of AMC for $4.25 each after calculating that Chrysler\\'s agreement with Renault, which contains variables based on AMC\\'s future performance, ultimately will give Renault as much as $8 to $9 a share. Her firm is gambling that AMC thus will be able to wring more from Chrysler for other shareholders.  Not everyone believes in that gamble. \"I\\'m telling my clients they should sell American Motors shares,\" said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s going to be a sweetener.\" He said that upon completion of the agreement with Renault, AMC warrants and junior convertible preferred shares that would be part of the transaction would help give Chrysler control of the board. Even though Chrysler at that point wouldn\\'t have two-thirds of the voting stock necessary to approve the acquisition, he said Chrysler nonetheless might not feel pressured to buy out minority holders, though it has said it wants all of AMC. AMC has about 116.7 million shares outstanding.  Wall Street analysts don\\'t see any other bidders stepping forward, though last year Ford Motor Co. evaluated and rejected making an offer. Still, AMC has retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to review Chrysler\\'s bid. And if Shearson concludes that $4 a share is inadequate, AMC may gain some additional bargaining leverage. But Charles Brady, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said, \"I think $4 (a share) is going to be accepted as a fair offer.\" An AMC spokesman said he expects Shearson to present at least a preliminary opinion at today\\'s AMC board meeting.  So far, AMC has been coy with Chrysler, issuing terse news releases saying merely that the Southfield, Mich.-based auto maker is evaluating Chrysler\\'s proposal. AMC executives have said they are frustrated about the timing of the bid, contending AMC was just about to turn the corner after a string of troubled years. The company\\'s Jeep sales are strong and AMC is just now introducing lines of larger Renault cars that could finally give it a position in a broader segment of the auto market -- but only if currently skeptical buyers start returning to AMC\\'s showrooms.  Investors \"think Chrysler is buying American Motors at the pivotal time,\" another arbitrage specialist said.  Under Chrysler\\'s stock swap offer, an AMC holder could get more than $4 a share if Chrysler\\'s stock exceeds $58.22 before the shares are exchanged. Some investors may be gambling on that appreciation and have chosen to buy AMC stock, instead of more expensive Chrysler shares, because \"this is a way of playing Chrysler for $4,\" one source familiar with the acquisition bid said. Nonetheless, Chrysler shares have continued to trade in the low 50s since the proposal was announced. Chrysler wouldn\\'t say whether it is buying AMC stock. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0071': 'Its Credibility in the Computer Industry --- By Janet Guyon Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN> In an attempt to buttress its flagging credibility in the computer industry, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans a big news conference next Tuesday to showcase new products and its latest top computer executive, Vittorio Cassoni.  Separately, James E. Edwards, an AT&amp;T senior vice president who preceded Mr. Cassoni as head of the computer division, said he is leaving the company, effective Monday.  According to managers in the computer, or Data Systems, division, AT&amp;T will announce new products that include an addition to its 3B minicomputer line, software products to connect its machines to those of International Business Machines Corp., a laser printer, the latest version of the Unix V operating system software and some local area network products.  None of the products are technologically significant but mainly catch up with competitors, AT&amp;T managers and consultants said. The announcements, to be made at AT&amp;T headquarters in three separate meetings with consultants, reporters and industry analysts, are meant to show that Mr. Cassoni and AT&amp;T are still serious about selling computers. The intent, AT&amp;T sources say, is to \"reassure customers unsettled by events of the past six months\" and \"convince customers who are still \\'on the fence\\' that AT&amp;T is the right choice.\"  AT&amp;T\\'s credibility in computers has plummeted as it has reshuffled management, posted pre-tax 1986 operating losses of $1.2 billion in the division, and appeared to be de-emphasizing computers in favor of long-distance phone service.  Product sales have been dismal recently; according to AT&amp;T sources, the company in January sold a mere 2,000 PC 6300 and 6300 Plus personal computers, its most successful machine, against a business plan of 120,000 for the year. Last year, sources say, the company took a $100 million write-off, in two steps, on its Unix PC, and stopped ordering the machine, resulting in layoffs and salary cuts at its maker, Convergent Technologies Inc., San Jose, Calif.  Several Data Systems executives have quit recently. John Walsh, a vice president in charge of the 3B minicomputer line, surprised colleagues in January when he left to join a small West Coast videoconferencing concern. And just yesterday Mr. Edwards said he is leaving to become president and chief executive officer of TelWatch Inc., a Boulder, Col., developer of systems to manage networks.  \"I\\'ve escaped,\" said Mr. Edwards. Telwatch \"had been working on me for the last 30 to 35 days to see if they could tempt me to leave Big Mama. I\\'ve always had the ambition to run my own company.\"  Though Mr. Cassoni has a tough job ahead of him, he is trying hard to reestablish AT&amp;T\\'s credibility. He attended an important personal computer industry conference in Phoenix, Ariz., last month -- the first year that AT&amp;T has gone to that particular conference. \"Vittorio seemed a lot more interested in what the industry is doing\" than past AT&amp;T computer executives, said John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc.  Mr. Edwards, who cited a number of reasons for AT&amp;T\\'s trouble in computers, also said he thought Mr. Cassoni\\'s job will be made easier by his coming from Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy, which has agreed to make and develop all AT&amp;T personal computers and workstations. He said he supported the decision made last October to replace him with Mr. Cassoni.  In Mr. Cassoni, \"you aren\\'t bringing in just another outsider. You are listening to a strategic partner,\" Mr. Edwards said. Since Mr. Cassoni arrived, \"my observation is that the strategic relationship with Olivetti is working better,\" he said. AT&amp;T previously had disputes with Olivetti over transfer pricing and marketing strategy.  Industry consultants said Mr. Cassoni\\'s approach thus far is to rank products in terms of profitability and cut those that aren\\'t money makers. \"He is either going to make it profitable or they are going to get out of the business, and I figure he has two years to do it,\" said David Taylor, a program director at Gartner Group who left AT&amp;T\\'s computer division last April.  But product managers also grumble that, because of directives from Mr. Cassoni\\'s bosses, whose experience is in AT&amp;T\\'s regulated long-distance business, expenses are being restricted so much that they can\\'t adequately serve customers. According to some, each product manager is allowed only $3,000 a year for travel and entertainment. On that budget, product managers say, they can\\'t determine what customers need, let alone sell them anything.  An AT&amp;T spokesman wouldn\\'t comment on specifics, but said the company would spend what was necessary to sell products.  \"If they really restrict them to that, there is going to be a lot of time spent over the phone,\" said Mr. Taylor. \"They won\\'t be able to hold people to that and get products out.\"  In addition, Mr. Cassoni is plagued by the same problem that hurt Mr. Edwards: He doesn\\'t have his own sales force to sell computers, but has to rely on a sales force that also sells long distance service, modems, multiplexers, telephones and office switchboards.

       " 'WSJ870320-0070': 'To Curb Price Swings --- Futures Exchanges Officials React Cautiously --- By Scott McMurray Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> A top Securities and Exchange Commission official proposed brief, simultaneous trading halts in stock and stock-index markets to combat excessive price volatility.  Richard Ketchum, head of market regulation for the SEC, said such an unprecedented step would eliminate the \"potential for a cascade or snowballing effect\" in the two markets, with heavy selling in stocks and stock-index futures feeding on itself.  He proposed the idea at a Futures Industry Association convention here, where the stock-price swings often associated with index-futures trading have dominated discussions. While a market crash is unlikely, Mr. Ketchum said, the prospect \"can\\'t be discarded entirely.\"  Regulators\\' struggle to moderate stock-price swings takes on added urgency this afternoon, during the quarterly \"triple witching hour.\" Traders and analysts are predicting extremely heavy volume near the close on the New York Stock Exchange, when stock-index futures, options and individual stock options all expire simultaneously.  In a related development, Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials discarded a previous plan aimed at addressing the problem. Bowing to pressure from securities firms, Merc officials said at the conference that they have withdrawn a controversial proposal, pending with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to place a 12-point daily limit on price moves in the Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index futures market. The S&amp;P pit is the biggest index futures market by far, accounting for more than 75% of all stock-index futures volume.  Several big securities firms that are members of the Merc objected to the idea, predicting that the price limit would become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy,\" William Brodsky, the Merc\\'s president, said. Fears that prices would hit the limit could send traders scrambling to close out their positions, thereby accelerating the price moves, he said. A \"limit move\" usually effectively halts trading by drying up bids or offers.  Critics of limits also said that once the Merc\\'s Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500 stock-index futures contract had reached its 12-point limit up or down from the previous day\\'s close, traders would simply transfer all their activity to the stock market, which trades without limits.  An SEC report on the volatility issue is set for release Monday. The agency studied swings in stock and stock-index prices last Sept. 11, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115 points in just over an hour before rebounding, and on certain days in December and January.  Mr. Ketchum said the SEC concluded that a fundamental change in investors\\' market outlook, reflected first in the declining bond market that day, was the main reason for the precipitous decline Sept. 11 and the following day.  Arbitrage trading, or simultaneous activity in stock-index futures and stocks, was \"a very substantial part but by no means a predominant part\" of the forces driving the decline, he said.  Mr. Ketchum said his suggestion for a joint trading halt, characterized by some industry executives as a trial balloon, was his idea, although he had discussed it with other senior SEC officials.  He proposed the idea, Mr. Ketchum said, as a way of \"building on (Big Board chairman) John Phelan\\'s suggestion of a safety net\" to keep the stock and stock-index futures markets from becoming locked into a precipitous pas de deux.  Futures-exchange executives were guarded in their response. Although Mr. Brodsky said he wasn\\'t aware of Mr. Ketchum\\'s trading-halt proposal before hearing it yesterday, he said it was \"worth discussing.\"  Lewis Horowitz, president of the New York Futures Exchange, a Big Board subsidiary that trades stock-index futures and options, said he would favor a meeting among stock and futures exchanges to consider the idea.  Mr. Ketchum also suggested that futures exchanges should consider allowing securities firms to use their capital to execute large trades that couldn\\'t be accommodated by traders in the futures pits. He drew a parallel with block trading on the Big Board, in which securities firms risk their own capital to match big trades off the trading floor.  Futures exchanges had been expected to lobby hard against further regulation at the convention on the grounds that more restrictions would hurt, rather than help futures markets.  Many futures industry officials are watching to see if additional steps taken by the Merc recently to curb abuses in the S&amp;P 500 pit will be adopted by, or pressed upon, other futures exchanges. The Merc last week announced reforms that, if adopted, will sharply restrict its S&amp;P 500 brokers from the industry-wide practice of trading for their own as well as customer accounts. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0069': 'Agree to Changes To Prevent Delays --- By Laurie McGinley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN> The nation\\'s airlines ended four days of meetings here, agreeing to make about 275 changes in their summer flight schedules to head off delays during peak times, according to Federal Aviation Administration officials.  In addition, said Edward Faberman, deputy chief counsel for the agency, the carriers had made about 70 changes immediately before the sessions began and have agreed to try to make more revisions for Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare International Airport and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in coming weeks. The main carriers at those airports will meet again with the FAA April 10.  The meetings, which the FAA supervised, convened Monday under a Transportation Department grant of antitrust immunity. The department contended that the carriers had scheduled too many flights at peak times, and that adjustments were needed to prevent delays this summer. Besides Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, other airports included in the talks were Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield International Airport, Newark, N.J., International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport.  Mr. Faberman said he was generally pleased with the results of the meetings -- except in the case of the Atlanta airport, where the carriers fell about 90 changes short of the goal of 290 revisions. \"We\\'re all a little disappointed about that,\" he said.  The carriers made about four dozen changes at Chicago, one at Dallas-Fort Worth and 13 each at Newark and Philadelphia. Mr. Faberman said that he was satisfied with the new schedules for Newark and Philadelphia, and that he hoped additional changes at Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth could be made at the April meeting.  The changes agreed to this week will involve the airlines\\' April-October schedules. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0068': 'Computer Stocks Weakest of OTC Technology Group --- By Priscilla Ann Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMPUTERS (EDP) PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN> As technology stocks go, recent history suggests, so goes the over-the-counter market. And OTC technology stock prices have been slipping this month.  They are slipping from far loftier price levels than most investors realize they\\'ve attained and, analysts say, that may be one reason why several major categories of OTC technology stocks are particularly vulnerable right now.  Technology issues comprise the second biggest group of stocks in the OTC market -- some 28% of the 4,600 stocks in the OTC\\'s Nasdaq automated quotation system.  While bank and financial stocks outnumber the technology issues, embracing one-third of the Nasdaq issues, their prices tend to proceed at a more leisurely pace. When prices of the volatile biotechnology, computer and electronic stocks all begin moving rapidly in the same direction, up or down, they can move the OTC composite 5% or more in a matter of days.  The current weakness in technology is confined to computer-related stocks, which have dropped about 5% in the past few weeks after roaring ahead more than 65% in the first two months of the year. Biotechnology and electronics stocks, the other two major technology subgroups, are still managing to creep ahead.  Followers of the computer-related stocks are watching International Business Machines Corp., which is about to disclose details of its clone-proof microcomputers. IBM\\'s announcement, expected in the first week of April, will make clearer which companies will be affected and how.  \"Investors are trying to guess what effect the new IBM clone-proof microcomputers will have on the various companies,\" explains Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. Among the worst hit are some of the disk-drive makers who have benefited from sales related to IBM\\'s current models. They have tumbled in price, dragging down with them even the stock prices of unrelated companies such as Maxtor Corp., a disk-drive maker whose sales have nothing to do with these IBM models.  \"Many investors just buy or sell groups,\" says Mr. Wolf.  Despite a slight recovery in the computer issues this week, the problem could get worse. \"The market hasn\\'t fully factored in IBM. Computer stocks could move down further when the announcement occurs,\" he adds.  Analysts say that the three big groupings of technology stocks don\\'t have an effect on one another, but when all three move up together, as they have this year, they can boost the broad performance measures of the whole OTC market. Thus, this year\\'s more than 50% jump in OTC technology stock prices has been the principal driving force behind a concurrent 25% rise in the Nasdaq composite index.  The huge technology stock price rise, verified by a broad Wall Street Journal sampling, has been far greater than many investors realize. That\\'s because the indexes commonly used to gauge technology stock trends, such as the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index, are imperfect measures of such performance in the OTC market. The PSE technology measure is up only 33% this year.  The PSE technology index also includes exchange-listed technology stocks, which have moved in a different pattern than the OTC issues this year. IBM alone accounts for 5% of this PSE index. And while IBM has driven the OTC computer group prices lower this month, its own price has risen 5% in recent weeks.  The OTC subgroup that has proved most volatile over the past few years is biotechnology, where stock prices still are moving up a bit. But, some analysts say, many of these stocks may now be fully priced and vulnerable.  \"The stocks are already pretty nicely priced relative to future earnings,\" says Robert Kupor, biotechnology stock analyst with Cable, Howse &amp; Ragen in Seattle. In fact, he says, multiples based on estimates of future earnings are about where they were in the second quarter of last year, when the biotechnology market peaked.  He also says the market in these stocks is psychologically driven, with investors reacting to guesses about what the companies may do in 1990 or 1992, rather than to current performance. Given that, and their lofty price levels, Mr. Kupor says he would \"not be stunned to see the biotechnology market top out\" as a result of \"any one or two negative events\" such as a delay in federal approval of a drug or a decision in patent law.  Stocks now moving the biotechnology group are the biomedical issues, including such stocks as Centocor Inc., up 12% since the beginning of March.  Like most other companies gaining ground in this group, there is an AIDS play. Centocor is working on an vaccine against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  Sometimes the connection to AIDS is tenuous. Amgen Corp., also up sharply in the past few weeks, is moving on speculation that a product it is developing to treat anemia may find a large market once the Food and Drug Administration approves azidothymidine, or AZT, a proposed AIDS treatment made by Burroughs-Wellcome Co. That\\'s because anemia is one of the reported side effects of AZT. \"The company also has a protein that could be given instead of transfusions, making it a double AIDS play,\" says Mr. Kupor. \"But who knows? Everyone is guessing.\"  In the electronics group, many semiconductor, microwave relay and other communications issues have been lackluster performers this month. But other shares have been advancing so strongly that they are lifting the performance of the group as a whole. These hot stocks include optical scanning and industrial robot development stocks, which were hardest hit in last fall\\'s technology stock sell-off and have been among the last to recover this year.

       " 'WSJ870320-0067': 'Arbitragers Are Baffled by Bids That Often Fail To Materialize --- By Randall Smith</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> Sometimes a takeover bid isn\\'t really a bid.  A spate of conditional acquisition proposals in the past year has confounded Wall Street arbitragers, who have lost money betting on \"bids\" proposed -- but never formally made -- for such companies as USX Corp., Lucky Stores Inc. and Borg-Warner Corp.  Here is an example of what happens:  Last Nov. 25, Borg-Warner directors received a letter from Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who together with Minstar Inc. controlled 7.7% of the plastics, car parts and chemicals concern and proposed to buy the rest for $43 to $48 a share.  Although the figures he used were quite specific, Mr. Jacobs said he wanted to see the books before negotiating a friendly acquisition. Even though his letter didn\\'t constitute a formal offer, it was referred to in news stories as a \"bid\" or an \"offer,\" and the stock rose $1.375, to $39, in response.  But the gulf between the stock price and the figures cited by Mr. Jacobs reflected skepticism that such a bid would really arrive. The letter was viewed as a move to hasten a restructuring, or to spark a bid by another Borg holder, GAF Corp.  Since then the company largely has ignored Mr. Jacobs, who threatened a hostile tender offer Feb. 19, and the stock has lagged behind the market.  Such tactics are \"in vogue,\" because they are \"a cost efficient way of stirring up the stew,\" said Arthur Fleischer, a merger lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson.  \"What is a postage stamp, 22 cents?\" he said. \"You can cause a lot of consequences to a company by simply sending a letter. Basically, you may -- but not necessarily -- put the company in play,\" he said.  Lawrence Schloss, a mergers executive at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said of those who make the proposals: \"Some are your basic greenmail artists. Some are bona fide buyers who see value but really don\\'t have the appropriate information to make an offer. And some are a combination of the two.\"  In an interview, Mr. Jacobs said he didn\\'t write the letter merely to stir the stew or put Borg-Warner in play, and said the company has agreed to talk to him. \"Don\\'t assume nothing is happening. Don\\'t assume we\\'re just sitting here waiting for the phone to ring,\" he added.  But he acknowledged that disclosure of a proposal may put pressure on a company to deal with a suitor. \"I think people who are running certain companies pay more attention to what Wall Street says sometimes. And if no one knows anything, then there\\'s no pressure (for the company) to say anything.\"  In a typical pattern, an investor will buy a 5% stake, try to get arbitragers to buy shares, and then make a bid \"proposal\" to focus attention on the potential values. Mr. Schloss said that target companies must usually hire investment bankers to evaluate the proposal. \"They have a fiduciary obligation to see if it\\'s real and then respond.\"  Once in play, the target company may negotiate with the \"bidder,\" seek a rescuing suitor, or execute a restructuring to boost the stock price. Plenty of takeover attempts turn into mergers or leveraged buyouts through just such a process.  \"Maybe it\\'s a way of starting talks with management. It works if you can find weak management that perceives itself as weak,\" said Juliusz Sas, a special situations analyst at the brokerage house Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. who has followed the Borg-Warner siege. \"It\\'s like pointing at them with an unloaded gun.\"  But for the corporate raider forced to pull the trigger in such a circumstance, the results can be an embarrassing \"click.\" That\\'s what happened at the denouement of Asher Edelman\\'s pursuit of Lucky Stores, a California grocery chain.  Mr. Edelman\\'s pursuit of Lucky had all the twists and turns of a Gothic novel. After accumulating a reported 3% stake, he proposed a $35-a-share friendly purchase in a letter disclosed Sept. 24. He demanded that any restructuring be \"prompt and efficient. Lip service will not satisfy me.\"  After company officials refused to meet Mr. Edelman, Lucky stock peaked at $37.875 in early October on reports that the investor was ready to launch a hostile tender offer. But he didn\\'t follow through on that threat after Lucky formally rejected the proposal Oct. 6 and began a defensive restructuring and stock buyback.  The investor then raised his proposed bid to $37 a share. Lucky rejected it again. Mr. Edelman dropped his proposal, then renewed it again Nov. 19 after buying more shares. But after holders approved the restructuring in late December, the stock fell to $26.  (Mr. Edelman was more determined in his pursuit of Ponderosa Inc. He disclosed a 19% stake in late November, and without further preliminaries, launched a tender offer Dec. 2 that, after some sweetening, snared the company.)  Two weeks ago, Mr. Edelman reached a three-year standstill agreement limiting his Lucky stake to 5% and barring him from attempting to gain control. Lucky paid him just $2.8 million to cover expenses.  Although Lucky shares have rebounded to $31.875, they have lagged behind the market since the takeover attempt, and some arbitragers are bitter. \"As far as I\\'m concerned, he sold his credibility for $2.8 million,\" said one.  Mr. Edelman was out of the country this week and couldn\\'t be reached for comment. His lawyer, Burton Lehman of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel, said that while Mr. Edelman\\'s proposals \"weren\\'t bids in the nature of a tender offer, they were serious bids seeking to work out a basis to purchase the company. But the company rejected each of them and went ahead and did its restructuring.\"  Perhaps the most prominent \"non-bid\" bid was Carl Icahn\\'s run on USX. Mr. Icahn and several other corporate raiders had taken positions in the depressed stock. On Oct. 6, he proposed a \"friendly\" $31-a-share acquisition, subject to a look at the books, but threatened a hostile tender if the company didn\\'t accept or undertake a \"radical\" restructuring.  One prominent merger lawyer said arbitragers erroneously \"treated Icahn\\'s conditional approach to U.S. Steel as an unconditional bid. It wasn\\'t a bid. He said he would make a bid \\'if-if-if.\\' But the Street treated them as a company that was in play.\"  Mr. Icahn and USX management soon became embroiled in a lengthy effort to agree on conditions under which the investor could look at the books. Then the insider-trading scandals that broke in mid-November tainted his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, putting in doubt some raiders\\' ability to get financing and leaving Mr. Icahn stuck in USX. The stock fell to 20 before rebounding on higher oil prices. In January, he abandoned the effort, but still owns the stock.  This month, Mr. Icahn and his Trans World Airlines made a proposal for a bid that got set aside before it was ever made. TWA bought 15% of USAir Group stock and suggested it might bid $52 a share for the whole company after USAir made a bid to acquire Piedmont Aviation.  The Icahn move was widely interpreted as an effort to foil a combination that stood to rob him of two choice candidates to merge with -- or, preferably, buy -- TWA. But USAir rejected the bid as \"highly conditional,\" among other things. After a federal judge blocked further purchases and Piedmont agreed to merge with USAir, Mr. Icahn said he wouldn\\'t seek control for the moment.  Many bona fide tender offers are contingent on the target company dropping anti-takeover provisions, including a bid this week by AFG Industries and Wagner &amp; Brown for GenCorp. Takeover experts said it is also legitimate for would-be acquirers to want to see a company\\'s books.  But last summer, Wagner &amp; Brown made a proposal for a bid that never went through. Wagner &amp; Brown suggested paying $50 a share for Panhandle Eastern Corp. last June 30, and the stock initially surged near that price.  But Panhandle soon rejected the bid and took a $460 million charge to settle a dispute with Algeria. Terms included what amounted to an anti-takeover provision giving the Algerians the right to sell Panhandle stock back to the company at an above-market price. The stock sank to $40 following those moves, as investors began to fear Wagner &amp; Brown wouldn\\'t really make a bid.  Possibly fearing another takeover move, Panhandle then spun off its most attractive asset, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and the two stocks combined eventually rose well above the $50 figure.  A proposed bid in the oil patch that never actually materialized came from Canada\\'s Belzberg family for Ashland Oil Inc. a year ago. The Belzbergs said they were prepared to pay $60 a share, but later accepted $51 a share from the company for their 9.2% stake.  Skeptics are already wondering about a proposal Feb. 23 from Columbia Ventures, a Miami-based partnership that said it might pay $19 a share for Harnischfeger Industries Inc. The stock, which initially ran up to $18.25 on the news, has since retreated to $17.625.  Of course, how a company treats a proposal varies according to the proposer\\'s identity. Mr. Schloss of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette said if it\\'s, say, Texaco Inc., directors have to consider it seriously. But, as Borg-Warner observed last month: \"We do not consider letters from Mr. Jacobs as formal offers or legally binding.\"  In deciding how to value a target company\\'s stock, arbitragers go through a similar thought process. Even though they have all taken greenmail in the past, Messrs. Icahn and Jacobs and Canada\\'s Belzbergs have gained credibility by actually buying companies on occasion.  However, one takeover speculator focuses on the target company instead of on the proposer. \"It doesn\\'t matter whether the bidder is serious,\" says this arbitrager. \"You look to see whether the target is going to care. Just look at the board of directors. People who are from the Boy Scouts of America\" aren\\'t likely to put up as much resistance as \"someone whose name is on the company.\"  ---  How Some Highly Conditional \\'Bids\\' Fared Stock\\'s \\'Bid\\'*      Initial Date**      Reaction***       Outcome Bidder (Target Company) TWA/Carl Icahn (USAir Group) $52         +5 3/8 to 49 1/8  Bid, seen a ploy to get 3/4/87                        USAir to buy TWA, is shelved Monday with USAir at 45 1/4; closed Wed. at 44 1/2 Columbia Ventures (Harnischfeger) $19         +1/2 to 18 1/4    Harnischfeger rejects 2/23/87                       bid Feb. 26 with stock at 18 3/8; closed Wed. at 17 5/8 Irwin Jacobs (Borg-Warner) $43-$48     +1/38 to 39       Borg-Warner ignores 11/25/86                      Jacobs; stock lags market, closed Wed. at 41 1/4 Carl Icahn (USX) $31         +1 1/8 to 27 5/8  \\'Bid\\' expires Oct. 22 10/6/86                       and stock later falls to 20; closed Wed. at 27 7/8 Asher Edelman (Lucky Stores) $35         +1 3/4 to 36      Lucky rejects bid and 9/24/86                       restructures; stock slumps to 26; standstill pact reached March 6; closed Wed. at 31 1/2 Belzberg family (Ashland Oil) $60         +2 5/8 to 54 5/8  Bid \\'deadline\\' passes, 3/26/86                       Ashland buys back Belzberg stake at 51; stock slips below 47, rebounds to 63 1/8 Wed. *Per share **Announced or disclosed ***On first trading day bid was known ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0066': 'Beals Takes Harley-Davidson on New Road --- By Jeff Bailey Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Vaughn L. Beals Jr. got up at a Washington news conference earlier this week and offered to give up what many U.S. chief executives would dearly love to have -- a stiff tariff against foreign competitors.  The chairman and chief executive officer of Harley-Davidson Inc., the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker, said his company doesn\\'t need the final year of a five-year tariff aimed at big Japanese motorcycles, and he asked the International Trade Commission to cancel it.  The move brought immediate praise from Congress and gave a boost to controversial efforts to aid other battered domestic industries with trade legislation. Mr. Beals\\'s offer to drop the tariff early \"is the kind of attitude in American business that we need,\" says an aide to Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, a Republican who backed Harley\\'s efforts to get the tariff in 1983. Harley\\'s move shows that a tariff can be a short-term tonic to a company, Sen. Heinz feels, and needn\\'t become a permanent lifeline, as opponents to such measures have warned.  But the 59-year-old Mr. Beals didn\\'t bring his company back from the brink of collapse by giving away competitive advantages, nor is he doing so now. His plea to terminate the tariff is more intended to portray Harley as a Chrysler Corp. on two wheels.  Mr. Beals concedes that the tariff, which falls to 10% from 15% April 1, is at this point worth little or nothing to Harley, the only remaining U.S. motorcycle maker. And some say it was never essential to Harley\\'s survival. \"I think they could have pulled it off without the tariff,\" says Kevin Bahr, a securities analyst who follows Harley at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee.  Rather, Mr. Bahr says, it was Harley\\'s streamlining of its manufacturing process and improvement of quality that saved the company. Some of the measures, such as so-called just-in-time inventory control, are patterned after Japanese industrial practices.  Though Mr. Beals was saying in Washington that the tariff had given Harley a \"respite from predatory import practices,\" the company noted in its stock offering last summer that \"the benefits . . . from the special tariff have been limited.\"  A spokeswoman at the trade agency said yesterday that Harley hasn\\'t yet filed its request to cancel the tariff and that, when it does, the agency will need at least three months to research the request and then make a recommendation to President Reagan.  Mr. Beals says that making such a request has been under consideration for several months, but that he wanted to wait until just before the tariff levels were lowered to 10%, when the tariff won\\'t be \"worth a whole bunch.\"  Mr. Beals, himself an avid rider of Harley\\'s big Electra Glide, or \"hog\" cycles, led a management buyout of Harley from its then-parent, AMF Inc., in 1981. Almost immediately, high interest rates, a soft market for big cycles and a global war for market share among the much bigger Japanese motorcycle brands, Honda and Yamaha, threatened to send Harley to the junkyard.  The two Japanese makers were rapidly introducing new models and cutting prices. Their U.S. inventories were bulging, threatening still more price cuts. \"When the elephants dance, the ants get trampled,\" Mr. Beals says. Harley also was still dogged by a 1970s reputation for uneven workmanship.  President Reagan granted the company tariffs on imported cycles with engines of 700 cubic centimeters or bigger, known as heavyweight cycles, beginning at 45% of wholesale prices and falling year by year to 35%, 20%, 15%, 10%, and ending in April 1988.  But, Mr. Beals notes, that was easily skirted. Japanese makers quickly began building so-called \"tariff busters\" -- cycles with engines between 690 and 699 cubic centimeters. And the glut of Japanese cycles already in the country wasn\\'t affected. \"I\\'d bet my net worth,\" Mr. Beals says, that some Japanese dealers are still selling \"new\" cycles that were imported before the tariff.  As a result of the improved manufacturing techniques he installed at Harley, Mr. Beals\\'s net worth is now considerable. His 15.9% stake in Harley\\'s almost six million shares, which went public last summer, had a value of about $12 million at yesterday\\'s closing price of $13.50, up 25 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.  Mr. Bahr says that\\'s a rich price -- almost 16 times 1986 operating earnings of 82 cents a share, or $4.3 million -- for a company in a mature industry, but adds that \"there is still kind of a mystique -- the only motorcycle company in America.\" Sales last year were $295.3 million and market share rose to about 19% from a 1983 low of 12.5%, Mr. Beals says.  Mr. Beals monitors quality by doing his business travel, weather permitting, on a \"hog.\" On a recent trip from San Francisco to Denver with his wife, Eleanor, he discovered a defect in the 1986-model seat: the rear, or passenger, seat tilted forward and Mrs. Beals\\'s helmet kept bumping his whenever he hit the brakes. They stopped in Reno, Nev., to call the factory, but test riders there had already found the flaw. ',\n",

The rating concern downgraded Bethlehem\\'s senior debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus and its subordinated debt to triple-C-minus from triple-C. S&amp;P affirmed its single-C rating on Bethlehem preferred stock. Dividends on the stock were suspended last year.  The actions reflect \"concern for Bethlehem\\'s viability over the intermediate term, rather than any immediate threat to solvency,\" S&amp;P said.  In light of Bethlehem\\'s \"weak financial condition, the firm\\'s ability to weather any substantial price competition or a general economic downturn is questionable,\" S&amp;P said.  Choosing bankruptcy, \"which relieved some of Bethlehem\\'s competitors of their financial burdens,\" is still an alternative for the company \"in the absence of any visible exit from the industry\\'s morass,\" the rating concern said.  The steelmaker\\'s liquidity, though, is strong relative to requirements this year, S&amp;P said. Bethlehem\\'s cash position improved to $463 million at year\\'s end from $395 million Sept. 30 and $99 million at the end of 1985.  But Bethlehem has raised its cash reserves through non-sustainable actions such as selling assets, reducing working capital and drawing on bank credit facilities, rather than from operations, S&amp;P said.  A Bethlehem spokesman termed the downgrading \"inappropriate\" in light of the company\\'s \"stability\" in the market, \"realization of the anticipated improvements in our steel operations\" and the current liquidity level. Bethlehem expects to maintain ample liquidity through this year, the spokesman said. ',\n",

Schmitt Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> First Interstate Bancorp, which last month dropped a takeover bid for BankAmerica Corp., asked shareholders to approve measures that would facilitate future acquisitions as well as discourage a hostile takeover of itself.  Separately, the company said in a regulatory filing that it was \"premature\" to decide whether it would have to reclassify any of its $504 million in Brazilian debt as non-accruing, following that nation\\'s recent suspension of payments on its foreign debt. First Interstate said if the loans were reclassified that it would reduce 1987 income before taxes by about $33.5 million. The company had 1986 net income of $337.9 million, or $7.19 a share.  In the proxy statement for its April 24 annual meeting, First Interstate asked shareholders to approve an increase in authorized common shares to 250 million from 100 million. The bank holding company said the increased number of shares could be used for acquisitions or other unspecified \"investment opportunities.\" It indicated that it currently doesn\\'t have any plans for issuing newly authorized common as part of a takeover. Other possible uses, it said, were for future financings, stock splits or dividends, and employee benefit plans.  First Interstate also said the jump in authorized shares would enable it to discourage a hostile takeover by issuing warrants or rights to purchase added shares. But it said it wasn\\'t aware of any effort to seek control, and that it doesn\\'t currently plan to use the shares as a takeover defense.  While abandoning its unsolicited $3.23 billion takeover offer for San Francisco-based BankAmerica, First Interstate has indicated continued interest in expanding outside its current 12-state territory, possibly into Texas. Several large California banks are changing their charters to give them more clout in dealing with unsolicited overtures, reflecting a recent change in California law to allow New York banks to make acquisitions in the state beginning in 1991.  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, First Interstate shares closed at $59.25, up 12.5 cents.  In addition, First Interstate disclosed that Charles W. Parry, chairman of Aluminum Co. of America, and L.S. Skaggs, chairman of American Stores Co., recently resigned as directors. It said Mr. Skaggs would remain on the company\\'s Utah bank board, but didn\\'t give a reason for Mr. Parry\\'s resignation. It also said Bruce Nordstrom, co-chairman of Nordstrom Inc., didn\\'t seek reelection for personal reasons. Ralph Davidson, Time Inc.\\'s executive committee chairman, was nominated to the board, leaving it with 14 members.  Reflecting a recent change in Delaware law, First Interstate also proposed to limit director liability for damages in cases of negligent or grossly negligent behavior. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0063': 'Decision to Sell Weapons to Iran --- President Denies Knowing Proceeds Were Diverted To Rebels in Nicaragua --- By Ellen Hume and John Walcott Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) AEROSPACE (ARO) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> A self-assured President Reagan vigorously defended his decision to sell arms to Iran, but said he \"would not go down that same road again.\"  In his first news conference in four months, Mr. Reagan last night appeared to do what his aides had said he had to do: He confidently fielded a barrage of questions about his secret Iran and Nicaragua policies and remained in command of the half-hour session.  The president again denied knowing that profits from the Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras. Asked whether he knew White House aides were directing private aid to the Contras, he acknowledged only that he knew private individuals and groups were aiding the insurgents after Congress cut off U.S. aid to them in 1984. \"I don\\'t believe it was counter to any law,\" Mr. Reagan said.  The president\\'s performance was in sharp contrast to his previous news conference Nov. 19, during which he appeared defensive and unfamiliar with the details of his own Iran policy. During that earlier session, Mr. Reagan repeatedly denied that the U.S. had condoned Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1985, but aides issued a correction minutes after the news conference ended. Last night, Mr. Reagan said that he simply had misspoken and that he immediately had directed his aides to set the record straight.  Asked why he initially told reporters there was \"no foundation\" to a report that the U.S. had secretly sold arms to Iran, the president said he was trying to save the lives of the American hostages in Lebanon and Iranian middlemen whom he believed were helping to free them. At the time, Mr. Reagan said, he believed two more hostages were about to be released.  \"I\\'m not going to tell falsehoods to the American people,\" he said. \"I\\'ll leave that to others.\"  On several occasions, however, the president appeared to contradict both Vice President George Bush and his own commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.  Asked whether Mr. Bush had advised against the Iran policy, Mr. Reagan said, \"No.\" Mr. Bush, on a campaign trip to Michigan last month, told reporters that he had \"expressed reservations\" about the Iran arms policy to \"key players\" in the administration.  Mr. Bush\\'s press secretary Steve Hart last night said the president\\'s statement didn\\'t contradict Mr. Bush\\'s February comments. Mr. Hart pointed out that Mr. Bush has said on several occasions that he supported the Iran policy. Mr. Hart wouldn\\'t comment on how that support, or the president\\'s comments, squared with the \"reservations\" Mr. Bush has said he expressed.  Although the commission, headed by former Sen. John Tower (R., Texas), reported that the Iranians had paid far more than market value for U.S. TOW anti-tank missiles, Mr. Reagan said the U.S. \"asked for $12 million, which was the cost -- no profit -- on those weapons.\"  The Tower Commission also reported that former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane testified that Mr. Reagan had given advance approval for Israeli arms sales to Iran in an August 1985 telephone call. Last night, Mr. Reagan said he didn\\'t think he\\'d approved the sales in a phone call. Erroneously recalling Mr. McFarlane\\'s testimony, Mr. Reagan last night said his former aide had testified that the approval was given during a meeting at Bethesda Naval Hospital, following the president\\'s colon cancer surgery in July 1985.  The Tower Commission also reported that the president changed his account of whether he approved the Israeli sales in advance, first saying he did and later saying he didn\\'t recall doing so. Last night, Mr. Reagan said he did approve the sales, but couldn\\'t remember when.  But when he was asked whether he also could have forgotten that he was told funds from the Iran arms sales were being diverted to the Contras, he replied: \"Oh no. You would have heard me from -- without opening the door to the office -- if I had been told that at any time. No. And I still do not have the answer to that money.\"  The president declined to say whether he thought former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former National Security Council aide Oliver North had deceived him by secretly funneling military aid to the Contras. \"I don\\'t know . . . I want to get to the bottom of this and find out all that has happened,\" he said.  But he defended his hands-off management, which the Tower board criticized. \"I think that most people in business would agree that it is a proper management style,\" Mr. Reagan said. \"You get the best people you can to do a job. Then you don\\'t hang over their shoulder. . . . The only time you move is if there\\'s incontrovertible evidence that they are not following policy, or they have gone down a road where they are not achieving what we want.\"  Earlier yesterday, it was disclosed that shortly before he tried to commit suicide last month, Mr. McFarlane wrote letters to his lawyer, Leonard Garment, and to three lawmakers, asserting that the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S. secretly offered to give $1 million a month to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1984.  Mr. McFarlane revealed the offer, but not who made it, in written testimony last month to the Tower Commission, which told of the offer in its report. Bank records made public this month by Contra leader Adolfo Calero show the insurgents received $1 million a month from a Swiss bank account between July 6, 1984, and Feb. 7, 1985, and a further $24 million between Feb. 27 and March 25, 1985.  Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan has denied that he or any other Saudi has offered aid to the Contras. The existence of the letters was disclosed yesterday in the Washington Post and confirmed by Mr. Garment. ',\n",

Atlanta Coca-Cola bottling received subpoenas last month for documents relating to the pricing practices of its Athens and Cornelia, Ga., operations, the Atlanta-based soft drink bottling concern disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing connected with a debt offering.  The company declined to elaborate on the disclosure.  Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49% owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., previously said in its initial offering prospectus that the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department was investigating allegations of price fixing in the industry. The prospectus said the investigation focused on various parts of the country, including territories where certain of the Coca-Cola Enterprises bottling units conduct business.  The investigation has already resulted in the conviction of an employee of Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. Coca-Cola Enterprises said its Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co. may also be indicted in a continuing investigation in that case.  In January, Mid-Atlantic Bottling was added as a defendant in a separate civil class-action suit filed by a customer of Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling, Coca-Cola Enterprises said.  Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling purchased Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Co. -- the territories that include Athens and Cornelia, Ga. -- in 1985. Should the grand jury investigation result \"in proceedings, fines or damages\" against Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling, the unit may have a claim for indemnity against the sellers of the Athens bottling concern under the terms of the purchase agreement, Coca-Cola Enterprises said in the filing.  Coca-Cola Co., the previous owner of the various Coca-Cola bottling units, entered into an indemnity agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises prior to the initial offering providing reimbursements to the company should the investigations result in criminal or civil fines.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $17.125 a share, down 37.5 cents. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0061': \"Continue to Dump Chips, U.S. Says --- By Art Pine Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> A Commerce Department review has confirmed charges by U.S. microchip makers that their Japanese competitors are dumping in foreign markets despite the two countries' semiconductor trade accord.  The analysis, distributed yesterday to senior U.S. officials, essentially says U.S. producers have a good case against the Japanese. Dumping is the practice of selling products in a foreign market below fair market value or the cost of production.  Under the pact reached July 31, Tokyo agreed to press Japanese chip makers to stop predatory pricing, both in the U.S. and in third-country markets. Tokyo also agreed to allow U.S. chip makers to have a larger share of the Japanese market.  Chip manufacturers in the U.S. have insisted for months that their own data -- which made up the lion's share of the information used in the Commerce Department review -- showed continued violations of the accord.  Japan has submitted new data that Tokyo says show recent Japanese enforcement efforts have resulted in some improvement, but U.S. officials say they haven't reviewed all of the data.  Next week, the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is slated to consider whether to impose the sanctions that the U.S. industry has requested against the Japanese. Although the outcome of that session still isn't certain, officials say there's strong support within the council for some sort of retaliation. Such action already has been recommended by a lower-level task force.  Precisely what kind of sanctions the council might impose isn't clear, but administration policy makers say the most likely action would be for the U.S. to impose punitive tariffs on Japanese products -- such as laser printers -- that use semiconductors, rather than try to limit imports of microchips themselves.  Imposing duties on semiconductor imports directly would hurt U.S. corporations that use microchips in the products they make, U.S. strategists said.  Officials say the council may put off formal action for a day or two to evaluate the new data Japan submitted.  Separately, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution calling on President Reagan to take action against the Japanese for violating the semiconductor pact. \",\n",

About $6 billion of securities are affected.  The ratings concern lowered the securities firm\\'s senior debt, issued both in the U.S. and in Europe, and its senior guaranteed Eurodebt to single-A-one from double-A-three. Merrill Lynch\\'s subordinated debt rating was lowered to single-A-two from single-A-one. The firm\\'s prime-1 commercial paper rating wasn\\'t changed.  Moody\\'s said that while Merrill Lynch\\'s earnings will continue to increase, its \"profitability will lag that of its peers.\" The agency noted that Merrill Lynch is increasing its risk by aggressively committing its capital to merchant banking activities such as bridge financing of mergers, and said that while Merrill Lynch is trying to improve its profitability by controlling costs, those attempts will be limited by accelerating competition.  Moody\\'s noted, however, that additions to senior management have aided Merrill Lynch\\'s efforts to enhance a broad range of credit, financial and operational controls.  Moody\\'s had placed the company\\'s ratings under review for downgrading last December.  A Merrill Lynch spokesman, citing a record performance in 1986, said the company was \"disappointed\" by the downgrading.

       " 'WSJ870320-0059': 'Is Taken in Stride By Carrington Chief --- Opinion Is Due to Lawsuit; Pharmaceutical Company Says Case Is Not \\'Serious\\' --- By Cynthia F. Mitchell Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> The president of Carrington Laboratories Inc. talks as if everything at his company is fine.  But the company\\'s year-end filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission discloses that Carrington\\'s auditors, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., qualified its opinion of the company\\'s financial statements because of the potential adverse effects of a pending lawsuit.  In the filing, the company said that it hasn\\'t received any payments since November from Nutri-Metics International Inc. -- which is suing Carrington -- for Nutri-Metics\\' purchase last year of Carrington\\'s direct-sales business.  Nutri-Metics filed suit against Carrington in January, claiming breach of contract and other charges, and asking for upward of $4 million in punitive damages, the filing said. Payments from the Industry, Calif.-based direct-sales concern constituted about 26% of Carrington\\'s sales for its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1986.  On top of that, the filing also disclosed that Carrington doesn\\'t currently have working capital to carry it past 1987, and that it doesn\\'t have a bank line of credit or other arrangement through which it can obtain additional funds. For its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, Carrington reported a loss of $3.4 million on sales of $3.5 million.  But Clinton Howard, Carrington\\'s president, is unfazed. The lawsuit, to which Carrington has responded with its own, is \"insignificant\" in his opinion, and didn\\'t warrant a press release at the time it was filed. \"We\\'ve been negotiating for settlement. Our own attorneys have agreed with us and felt that Nutri-Metics didn\\'t have any serious suit, so we didn\\'t feel it was worthy of sending (a press release) over,\" he said.  Carrington will generate working capital past 1987, Mr. Howard and the filing said, by granting other companies licenses to develop and market products containing Carrisyn, a pharmaceutical using derivatives from the aloe vera plant that the company claims successfully treats bedsores, ulcerative colitis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The company says it plans to seek approval soon from the Food and Drug Administration for human clinical tests of its compound as an AIDS treatment. In October, the FDA ordered a private physician to stop his independent human tests of the compound as an AIDS treatment.  Mr. Howard said the company is in \"serious\" discussions with three large drug companies for Carrisyn licensing agreements. Also, he said, the company\\'s wound-treatment division is \"growing fast\\' and alone could support the company\\'s cash needs in about a year.  As for the company\\'s profitability, Mr. Howard predicts Carrington will be in the black by the end of the year.  Nutri-Metics could not immediately be reached for comment.  In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Carrington common stock, which has traded as high as $33 and as low as $9.25 in the past year, closed at $21, down 25 cents. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0057': 'Shearson-Stake Offering, Sources Say --- By Steve Swartz and Michael R. Sesit Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> American Express Co.\\'s board will be asked Monday to approve a public offering of part of the company\\'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. securities unit, company sources said.  Meanwhile, American Express announced that it had reached an \"understanding\" to sell a 13% stake in Shearson to Tokyo-based Nippon Life Insurance Co. for about $530 million.  American Express sources said that if the board approves the public offering, an announcement would be made late Monday, followed by a news conference Tuesday. The sources declined to say how much of Shearson, one of the nation\\'s largest and most profitable securities firms, might be offered to the public.  Board approval is also necessary before a definitive agreement can be reached with Nippon Life, by far Japan\\'s largest life insurance concern. The Nippon Life accord also hinges on the approval of Japan\\'s Ministry of Finance.  American Express declined to comment on the reports of plans for a board vote on a Shearson offering.  In its announcement, which was expected, American Express, the charge-card and travel-services giant, said it and Shearson would \"explore mutually advantageous, nonexclusive business and investment opportunities\" with Nippon Life.  American Express has been anxious to improve its own stock price and to relieve itself of the burden of funding Shearson\\'s mounting need for capital. Like other major securities houses, Shearson is rapidly expanding operations overseas, while investing increasing amounts of its own funds in corporate finance, an activity known as merchant banking.  At the end of last year, Shearson had equity capital of $1.36 billion and total capital, including debt, of $2.8 billion.  But Rodney Schwartz, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., figures Shearson should have a value of about $4.3 billion in equity if it were a stand-alone firm in the public market.  American Express sources said the $530 million from Nippon Life would be added to Shearson\\'s equity capital. The increased equity would also allow Shearson to borrow more.  American Express\\'s confirmation of a deal with Nippon Life, which had been rumored in the market Wednesday, sent its stock up only 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $78.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume was roughly 1.5 million shares, about half Wednesday\\'s turnover, when the stock climbed $1 on rumors of the Nippon Life tie.  Analysts calculated that Shearson\\'s book value is now about $1.49 billion. Thus, analysts said, the indicated 2.7-times-book value Nippon Life would be paying for its stake is slightly better than what some other top securities firms have been trading at in the public market.  A Nippon Life association also would offer Shearson a link with one of the wealthiest Japanese financial institutions and an influential partner in one of the world\\'s most dynamic financial markets.  Backed by one of the world\\'s highest savings rates and a huge current account surplus -- a broad measure of trade in goods and services -- Japan is one of the most liquid countries in the world. A slowing domestic economy is encouraging Japanese individuals and institutions to invest more in financial instruments, a trend that benefits large securities firms such as Shearson.  Analysts see a role for Shearson as a money manager as well as an agent for Nippon Life\\'s purchases of U.S. government securities and stocks. As of March 31, 1986 -- the end of its fiscal year -- Nippon Life had the equivalent of $82.98 billion in assets.  Analysts also said that Shearson, which has a unit that structures real estate limited partnerships, could work with Nippon Life on real estate investing. Nippon Life also could help Shearson obtain investment banking relationships in Japan and a seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  A Nippon Life-Shearson partnership wouldn\\'t face the strict management restrictions that the Federal Reserve Board placed on Sumitomo Bank Ltd.\\'s $500 million investment in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. last year. The federal Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and investment banking, doesn\\'t apply to insurance companies.  In the U.S., Nippon Life has a representative office and three subsidiaries. The office mostly conducts research and analysis of U.S. financial markets for its Tokyo parent.  A wholly owned unit, Nissei Life America Inc., acts as an agent, selling life insurance products, mostly to Japanese companies in the U.S.  Nippon Life also has a subsidiary, Nissei Realty Inc., which invests in U.S. real estate, and a joint venture with Bank of Tokyo Ltd. that manages assets on behalf of non-American investors.

       " 'WSJ870320-0056': 'Argentina Looks to Stem the Flow of Emigrants --- By Eduardo Helguera</HL> They came in ships, at the turn of the century and after the world wars. By the hundreds of thousands they came, all of them looking for a better life. Six million European immigrants arrived in Argentina between 1860 and 1964, and they slowly drew the features of Argentina\\'s 30 million population.  Today, however, their discouraged grandchildren are crowding the planes that will take them to more promising latitudes. Since 1960 approximately 601,000 Argentines have settled abroad, according to a report co-sponsored by the Center for Population Studies and the United Nations Institute for Social Development and Research. The most sought after destinations are the U.S., Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, Australia and Canada.  \"I will be out of work shortly; that\\'s why I want to leave,\" says Ruben Arabean, a 30-year-old engineer, married with two children. As he waits in line for his immigration visa at the Australian Embassy, he explains: \"I want to live in a country where things are planned out, where the budget is approved at the beginning of the year, not at the end.\" While a television screen publicizes the bounties of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, Mr. Arabean concludes: \"If I don\\'t take the leap at 30, I\\'ll never do it.\"  The diaspora craze is so pervasive that in September a consulting agency for potential emigrators opened its offices at the fancy Alvear Palace Hotel. Orientar, as the firm is called, publishes a $24 guide with 10,000 tips to get jobs, second passports and work permits in 26 countries. \"In less than two weeks we sold out our first edition,\" says Carlos Alberto Denari, Orientar\\'s enthusiastic director. He explained that his firm also runs a computerized data bank connected to personnel agencies in the U.S. and Italy.  An unrelentless economic decline -- the legacy of several decades of corporate-statist presidents and military governments -- is the clue to understanding Argentina\\'s new status as a breeder of emigrants. While there are encouraging new signs that Argentine policy makers may, at last, be recognizing the destructive qualities of a bloated, statist economy, those who are leaving need more substantive evidence of a change in the economy.  Argentina began to shed its population in the 1960s, after the full impact of Juan Peron\\'s statist economy became manifest. Enrique Oteiza, a U.S.-trained engineer and social scientist who studied the issue at the time, concluded in a study titled \"Argentine Brain Drain\" that the emigration was a response to serious structural problems in Argentina: While the state universities produced thousands of professionals every year (tuition and admissions were -- and still are -- free), the economy made little use of them. Many important economic areas were, and still are, out of bounds for those professionals who had no entry into government bureaucracies (because oil, coal, gas, electricity, post office, railways, airways, communications and water supply are activities monopolized by the state companies). This created, and still creates, an academic lumpen-proletariat, forced either to evade the shrinking, formal economy by operating within the underground economy or to physically get out, which is another form of evasion.  Brutal left-wing terrorism, a \"dirty-war\" military reaction that stopped the chaotic aggression at a significant social cost and chronic three-digit inflation rates were the hallmarks of the 1970s. This grim decade saw an additional 248,000 Argentines leave their homeland, this time from all segments of society.  Of course, the return to democracy in 1983, and President Raul Alfonsin\\'s commitment to halt inflation, slowed the urge to leave for a short time. But the increasing focus on the debt and uncertainty about the future of the economic \"Plan Austral\" -- particularly in light of the failure of the Cruzado Plan in neighboring Brazil -- have once again been pushing people out the door.  Recent statements from President Alfonsin\\'s top advisers indicate that Argentina\\'s economic planners seem much more willing to adapt to the realities of the marketplace than were Brazil\\'s planners. Adolfo Canitrot, secretary of economics, was quoted this week as saying: \"An open market is the only acceptable way out for Argentina\\'s problems and to achieve sustained growth.\" Other advisers have stressed the need for the state to get out of the productive sectors and manage only the essential services. However, to reverse the flow of emigration, the government must tackle some extremely complicated byproducts of statist management:  --Pensioners, who were forced to pay mandatory retirement dues to the state while in active work, are now obliged to survive on less than $70 a month. Years of regimes continually dipping into the social-security well for their own purposes have all but bankrupted the system. When the Supreme Court ruled that the state would have to pay senior citizens close to $25 billion (half the country\\'s foreign debt) in delayed or underassessed pensions, the Executive declared a \"state of social-security emergency,\" because the money simply doesn\\'t exist. President Alfonsin has expressed interest in starting a private social-security system.  --Argentina\\'s informal (underground) economy may be as high as 60% of its GNP, a thorough analysis carried out by the Institute for Contemporary Studies revealed recently. This means that more than half of the population finds no incentives to produce and save within the legal economic system. Those disincentives that drive people out of the legal sector must be identified and eliminated.  --A terribly confusing and ominously progressive tax system (in which 36% of all tax revenue comes from 1,500 taxpayers) just gets worse. People continue to try every trick to avoid taxes while the government continues to increase taxes. Value-added tax evasion is estimated to be 70%. Out of 2,800,000 taxpayers, only 1,200,000 bother to file returns. Despite many tax-amnesty bills, the root causes of tax evasion -- regulation and excessive taxes -- are not attacked.  --The law of privatization is stalled in Congress, and, anyway, excludes the 11 \"Sacred Cows\" (the state monopolies). The new emphasis is on making state monopolies more efficient by creating an interministry holding company with \"really capable\" businessmen to run them.  --Nothing is done about federal expenditures -- they seem to be \"inelastic,\" as a government official said recently. Yet the public sees millions wasted in ways that become increasingly difficult to justify. For example, three of the four television stations are owned by the government, and two of those stations sustain a combined loss of $2 million a month. The private station makes about $1.2 million a month.  Yes, the winds seem to be slowly changing for the better. But the emphasis still seems to be misplaced. \"Enlightened protectionists\" say: \"Make the monopolies more efficient,\" without placing enough emphasis on deregulation and complete privatization. Until this is achieved, and a favorable socioeconomic environment is restored, people will go where it is simpler and more profitable to live.

Municipal bond prices fell while corporate bonds drifted slightly lower. Most of the attention was focused on several large new issues.

Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\\'s index of long-term Treasury bonds declined 0.51 point to close at 1427.64. The high level for the day was 1431.64, while the low was 1426.18.

It averaged 6.07% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. On Wednesday, it averaged 5.97%.  The rate on the Treasury\\'s latest three-month bills fell slightly to 5.50% bid from 5.52% Wednesday. But the rate on the Treasury\\'s latest six-month bills rose to 5.51% from 5.48%.  The Federal Reserve yesterday reported that the nation\\'s basic money supply, known as M1, rose $500 million in the week ended March 9. That was a much smaller increase than many analysts had expected, but bond traders ignored it anyway because the Fed appears to be paying little or no attention to M1. Fed officials have indicated that they feel the M1 measure has lost its reliability as an indicator of economic and inflation trends.  The Fed estimated that the M1 measure rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $738.7 billion from $738.2 billion the previous week. The M1 measure consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public.

       " 'WSJ870320-0053': 'Crude Oil Prices Ease in a Session Of Uneasy Trading --- By John Valentine Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN> Crude oil spot and futures prices eased and some petroleum product futures prices firmed after wide intraday swings in choppy and uncertain trading.  The April crude oil contract opened higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange before dropping to an intraday low of 38 cents a barrel under Wednesday\\'s close. But late demand pared the decline to a modest nine cents a barrel, with the April contract settling at $18.60 a barrel. The May contract managed to close up 18 cents at $18.36 a barrel.  In the heating oil market, the April contract posted a gain of 0.24 cent for the day, settling at 50.59 cents a gallon, while the May contract closed at 49.38 cents a gallon, up 0.80 cent. Both months recovered from early price weakness. The spot, or non-contract, price rallied from early declines, but didn\\'t manage to get into the plus column for the day. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, late in the day was quoted at $18.70 a barrel, a decline of about 15 cents after earlier being as much as 35 cents lower.  Some traders blamed the early weakness in product prices for the selling pressure on crude oil futures, the same situation that drove the market Wednesday. One analyst said there\\'s a spreading perception that recent tightness in heating oil has been alleviated somewhat as the heating oil season draws to a close. Analysts said that some traders, instead of rolling forward their positions by selling their April contracts and reinstating them in more deferred contracts, were liquidating them outright, creating pressure on the market.  One analyst said the feeling was growing that the market has reached its nearterm objective of $19 a barrel and \"the enthusiasm to buy oil at $19 isn\\'t what it was at $16.\" Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for Josephthal &amp; Co., New York, termed the market \"basically overbought.\" The market appeared to be ignoring a 1% decline in North Sea oil production, to 2.75 million barrels a day, because it was ascribed to maintenance work, he said. \"I see the market pulling back somewhat to the $18 to $17.90 area,\" Mr. Cardillo said.  Eric Bolling, oil broker for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Boston, believed most of the heavy selling that prevailed in all positions was principally hedging by oil companies to protect prices of oil they had bought. The pre-expiration liquidation in the April contract pushed that position down more than the other months, he acknowledged.  In other futures markets yesterday:  STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices climbed as traders began to bail out of the market in anticipation of today\\'s triple witching hour, or simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures and options and individual stock options. To avoid an anticipated volume surge this afternoon, many traders closed out their positions, said Jeffery Tabak, a managing partner of Miller, Tabak, Hirsch &amp; Co., New York. Another factor was the New York Stock Exchange\\'s planned tightening of rules on disclosure of stock trades before today\\'s close. \"There was a lot of unwinding\" of positions, said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Commodity Corp., Chicago. Generally, though, traders\\' worries about a possible washout today eased. Mr. Tabak said, \"There was concern toward the end of last week that it would be a very down day. People are now fairly convinced it won\\'t be.\" Continued speculation that Japan and West Germany will make a new round of discount rate cuts, stimulating their economies, also lifted stock-index prices, some analysts said.  LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Pork belly futures prices rose the maximum daily limit of $2 for the second consecutive day. Traders are \"trying to get prices high enough to divert bellies into storage,\" said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. Light movement of bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, into storage may create a shortage this summer, analysts said. Higher wholesale prices buoyed hog prices, analysts said. Cattle prices continued their upward trend.  SUGAR: Futures prices closed higher despite a higher estimate of Cuban production by a major London sugar brokerage house. The May contract ended 0.13 cent higher at 7.77 cents a pound after recovering from an early decline touched off by the projection, according to analysts. The British brokerage, C. Czarnikow, estimated Cuban production this year will total 7.5 million metric tons, about 1.5 million tons ahead of last year\\'s output, analysts said. Earlier predictions among traders had Cuban production dropping to as little as six million tons because of drought and harvesting delays. The market is more focused on the perception that new demand for sugar is about to come from Japan, South Korea and China, although traders said they didn\\'t have details. One analyst observed that if Czarnikow\\'s Cuban projection proves accurate, any Soviet buying on the world market would be reduced significantly. With a 7.5 million-ton harvest, Cuba might supply about 3.7 million tons to the Soviet Union and this, along with estimated Soviet domestic output of about 8.75 million tons, would leave only a few hundred thousand tons for the Soviets to buy, the analyst said.  GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices were mixed. Lack of generic certificate movement and continued rumors about Soviet corn purchases gave strength to the nearby contract, analysts said. Wheat prices finished mixed on speculation that a speech by a high-level government official could result in subsidized wheat sales to the Soviets. Soybean and meal prices were up as oil prices closed lower. ',\n",

Under Connecticut banking laws, a New England bank holding company such as Fleet wouldn\\'t be allowed to operate a Connecticut bank holding company if it merged with a non-New England company. Norstar is based in Albany, N.Y. Last March, Fleet acquired First Connecticut Bancorp, a Hartford-based bank holding company that operates four banks in that state.

The merger still requires regulatory clearance and approval by both companies\\' shareholders.

The move is aimed at helping the institutions maintain their \"financial health,\" the banks said.  The group, which includes Fuji Bank Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., said the new company, JBA Investment Inc., will be based in the Cayman Islands.  Bank officials said JBA Investment, capitalized at $84,000, will be headed by Shigeru Murata, former managing director of Fuji Bank.  The company will issue preferred stock, which will be purchased by the participating banks. Proceeds from the stock sales will be used to buy Latin American loans from the banks at a discount. Then the company will either pool the loans and try to resell them to investors, or hold them to maturity.  The establishment of JBA Investment is \"part of the efforts by the country\\'s commercial banks to counter the problem of Latin America\\'s mounting external debts and its inability to pay interest,\" one official said.

Under the current pact, which was reached in February 1986, South Africa agreed to repay $2.5 billion last year, including $500 million of principal. The government had proposed much easier repayment terms, including a moratorium on payments until 1990. But South Africa has been meticulous in making debt payments on time since last year\\'s agreement. Mr. Stals said last September that the country intends to repay a further $2 billion in 1987.

The delay stems from opposition party members objecting to the tax plan.

But after being named acting chief executive in September, Mr. Tisch was quoted in various news reports as saying that, for example, he didn\\'t want to become permanent chief executive and had \"complete confidence\" in his top managers. And he described initial reports that he was seeking major budget cuts at CBS News as \"ludicrous.\"  Later, Mr. Tisch was named permanent chief executive after hinting he wanted the post; stripped the head of CBS publishing operations of his duties; and approved $30 million in cutbacks at CBS News.  At least one director, Walter Cronkite, has criticized Mr. Tisch\\'s handling of the news cuts, which included the dismissal of 215 people and the closing of three bureaus. But the board agreed with Mr. Tisch that the cuts were necessary. Mr. Tisch still faces scrutiny in Congress, which is preparing to hold hearings on news division cuts at all three networks.  Mr. Tisch attributed the apparent contradictions to, among other things, being misquoted or taken out of context in some news reports; misinterpretation by some CBS managers to his off-the-cuff remarks, which were leaked to the press. He also noted that changing circumstances sometimes caused him to change his mind.  \"The most important thing to me is my integrity,\" Mr. Tisch said, \"and everything I\\'ve said has been true\" at the time.  Colleagues also attribute Mr. Tisch\\'s public relations problem to inexperience in the spotlight that comes with being CBS chief executive. \"He didn\\'t realize how public it is and how quickly the tide could turn against him,\" said one CBS executive.  As chairman of Loews Corp., which now controls 25% of CBS shares, Mr. Tisch rarely spoke with the press and wasn\\'t subject to much public scrutiny. And until now, Mr. Tisch has been known primarily as a savvy investor and top stock-picker rather than as a corporate manager.  Associates say Mr. Tisch was particularly troubled by the backlash over the recent CBS News cutbacks. Mr. Tisch initially said CBS News President Howard Stringer initiated the cuts. But later, after Mr. Stringer protested, he acknowledged that he had suggested the division might operate efficiently with 15% to 20% less money.  On the advice of friends, Mr. Tisch is consulting public relations specialist John Scanlon, who is known in part for his work in CBS\\'s defense of a libel suit brought by retired Gen. William Westmoreland and for his handling of public relations for New York City during its 1970s fiscal crisis. \"I think he said to me, \\'Don\\'t be as off the cuff\\' as I\\'ve been,\" Mr. Tisch said.  And now Mr. Tisch plans to be more careful about his press contacts. \"I\\'ve lost a certain confidence in the press, I must say,\" he said in yesterday\\'s interview, which CBS tape-recorded and which was attended by a senior CBS public relations executive. \"I won\\'t be as ready just to talk to people over the telephone,\" he said.

Federal aid to public schools totaled $8.9 billion in fiscal 1985, which ended Sept. 30, 1985. This compares with $9.1 billion, or about 9% of the total, in fiscal 1980. About $1.4 billion went to local school systems directly in fiscal 1985; another $7.5 billion was distributed through state and local governments for vocational education, school lunch, and other programs.  The Census Bureau reported that public school revenue totaled $146 billion in fiscal 1985, a 9% increase from the year before. An 11% increase in direct state aid was the main reason for the rise. State aid accounted for 46% of general public school revenue in fiscal 1985. Local taxes and governments accounted for 48% of total revenue for schools, with property taxes being the single largest source of local revenue.  Spending rose 9% in fiscal 1985 to $143 billion. Salaries continued in 1985 to represent the largest single area of spending, at 60%. Construction outlays for the year rebounded after a four-year decline, rising 23% to $5.2 billion. Increases were reported by 40 states. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0038': 'Takeover Offer Loophole</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) </IN> A Senate panel voted to plug loopholes that allow many partnerships to begin takeover bids without first filing under the pre-merger notification requirements of antitrust law.  Currently, partnerships that are formed specifically to complete such acquisitions often can acquire large blocks of shares in target companies without disclosing the purchases. They also don\\'t have to provide the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission with information about their intentions and the likely competitive impact of the proposed transactions.  The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee yesterday approved by voice vote a measure to include partnerships in the filing requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

In a rhetorical broadside against Democratic lawmakers, the president said that some in Congress \"want to back away from our commitment to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Some are even saying they want to raise taxes again on the American people. Well, I\\'m sorry, but that isn\\'t going to happen.\"  The statement increased the pressure on congressional Democrats who are encountering political difficulties in fashioning a budget for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. The chairmen of the House and Senate Budget committees have said that meeting the Gramm-Rudman law\\'s deficit target of $108 billion for fiscal 1988 is impossible without resorting to accounting gimmicks.  Still, the president seems to have left the door slightly ajar for some type of tax increase that doesn\\'t involve tax rates. Using language almost identical to a recent speech, he said: \"My pledge to veto any tax-rate increase remains rock solid.\"  The president also reiterated his condemnation of the federal budget process, calling it \"unworkable.\" Administration officials have said in recent days that the White House soon will send Capitol Hill a package of proposed revisions in the budget process.

       " 'WSJ870320-0034': 'Industrials Rise, But Uneasiness Keeps Average Beneath 2300 --- By Beatrice E. Garcia</HL> STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN> The Dow Jones Industrial Average once again flirted with 2300 in nervous trading on the eve of today\\'s triple witching hour in the futures and options markets, but a final-hour rally fell a shade shy of that century mark.  Blue-chip stocks such as the 30 issues that make up the industrial average posted bigger gains than secondary stocks. The industrial average rose 12.64 to 2299.57 -- its third consecutive record.  In addition to some nervousness over the impending futures and options expirations, the usual profit-taking when the industrial average approaches century marks might have pushed prices down slightly just before the closing bell, some traders said. The average had traded briefly above 2300 during Wednesday\\'s session.  Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index moved up 1.30 to 294.08, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.64 to 167.28. Both market indexes also continued their winning streaks, but Big Board gainers just outpaced losers, 855 to 759.  Trading was more active in the latter part of the afternoon, but overall volume was rather light by 1987 standards. More than 166.1 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, down from 198.1 million Wednesday.  Fear of the wild price swings that have occasionally accompanied triple witching hour -- the once-quarterly simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks -- has been keeping major institutional investors on the sidelines this week, traders said.  Richard Kehne in the equity trading department at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. said, \"We talked to several major institutions who said they weren\\'t doing anything\" out of concern about triple witching hour.  Trying to figure out what stock prices will do in the final minutes of trading is \"almost like tossing a coin,\" said Gerald Simmons, a managing director with Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York.  The talk around some trading desks on Wall Street yesterday was that there could be an upward push on stock prices late today and that a large number of shares would be traded in the final minute because of a barrage of market-on-close orders. Close to 100 million shares changed hands in the final minute at the previous triple expiration, Dec. 19.  One futures trader estimated that if index funds, which tailor their portfolios to match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index, still own the March S&amp;P 500 contract, they would have to either buy stocks or the June futures contract to replace the expiring March contract before today\\'s close. Because the June S&amp;P 500 contract is trading at a healthy premium to the S&amp;P 500 index, this trader believes such fund managers might be more inclined to buy the stocks. Most index fund managers are required to be fully invested in either the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 index or the futures contracts.  In an attempt to curb stock-price volatility, the Big Board is asking members to enter voluntarily all market-on-close orders by 3:30 p.m. EST. Word of order imbalances will then be quickly disseminated through the market and, after 3:30 p.m., only market-on-close orders on the other side of the imbalance or to initiate an arbitrage position can be entered.  Some market participants said these guidelines were a little vague and may still leave plenty of room for surprises at the closing bell. At the Dec. 19 expiration, while it initially appeared that there would be substantially more sell orders to be processed at the close, a surprise buyer -- Salomon Brothers -- emerged in the final minutes and more than soaked up all the supply, driving up prices dramatically. However, futures traders said that there are so many different strategies investors could employ today that accurately predicting the final impact on stock prices is impossible.  American Express inched up 1/8 to 78 3/4 on more than 1.4 million shares. The financial services concern confirmed that it has a general agreement to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan a 13% interest in its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit for $530 million. Wednesday, the stock rose a point on rumors of this transaction.  Nancy Young, who follows the brokerage industry for Tucker Anthony, estimates that Nippon Life would be paying nearly 2.8 times book value for the Shearson stake. Because many publicly owned brokerage firms are trading between 1.5 times and 2.5 times book value, she believes investors \"have been significantly undervaluing\" these stocks.  That would help explain the rise in many brokerage stocks despite the news that Boyd L. Jefferies, chairman of Jefferies Group, abruptly resigned from the company and agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating securities laws in a case partly stemming from the Ivan Boesky scandal. Jefferies Group closed down 1/4 at 11 after trading as low as 9 1/4 in the over-the-counter market.  Merrill Lynch rose 2 1/2 to 45 1/4 in active trading. The stock was reportedly recommended by PaineWebber. Separately, Moody\\'s Investors Service downgraded Merrill Lynch\\'s long-term debt.  First Boston rose 1 to 51 1/4, E.F. Hutton moved up 1 1/4 to 41 1/8, L.F. Rothschild advanced 1 1/8 to 14 3/8, PaineWebber moved up 7/8 to 37 3/4 and Bear Stearns added 1 to 21 3/4. However, Salomon eased 1/4 to 41 1/2.  Morgan Stanley jumped 4 1/4 to 74 7/8. Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services, speculated that some investors were betting that Morgan Stanley might attract another foreign investor that would be willing to pay top dollar for the Wall Street firm. But Mr. Long believes the price gains posted yesterday are likely to disappear once all the excitement over the Shearson Lehman-Nippon Life deal fades.  ChemLawn rose 2 3/8 to 34 1/8 in OTC trading. Waste Management is prepared to raise its bid for ChemLawn to $33 a share from $27 if the company is willing to negotiate a two-step merger plan. ChemLawn had rejected a $27-a-share offer as inadequate. Waste Management rose 1 1/2 to 76 3/8.  Another OTC stock, AmeriTrust, rose 1 3/4 to 53 1/4. The company proposed a 2-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend. An investor group led by Equitable Bancorp Chairman Alfred Lerner said Monday that it holds a 9.6% stake in AmeriTrust.  GenCorp continued to advance, gaining 2 1/2 to 109 in active trading. It soared 16 Wednesday. A partnership affiliated with AFG Industries and Wagner &amp; Brown has launched a surprise tender offer at $100 a share.  Stars-to-Go sprinted ahead 1 to 18 1/2 in OTC trading. The company signed a contract to install its video rental program with Convenient Food Mart, a chain of about 1,320 franchised convenience stores. It signed a similar agreement with Circle K last week.  Pennzoil fell 1 1/8 to 80 5/8. Texaco is asking an appeals court to order a new trial in its litigation with Pennzoil, claiming that Pennzoil didn\\'t file a court-ordered reply to a Texas appeals court that slightly reduced the multibillion-dollar judgment awarded to Pennzoil by a lower court jury. Texaco\\'s stock eased 1/8 to 35 3/8.  Other oil issues pared early losses, just as crude oil prices moved off their lows late in yesterday\\'s futures trading session.  Colonial Municipal Income Trust, an initial offering of a closed-end mutual fund, was the Big Board\\'s most-active issue, with more than 3.1 million shares changing hands.

Gen. Richard Secord to turn over private bank records related to the Iran-Contra affair.  The resolution was approved on a voice vote without debate, and Michael Davidson, the Senate legal counsel, said he will file a motion in federal court next week. If the Senate is successful, Gen. Secord risks being held in contempt of court until he turns over the records sought by the Senate committee investigating the scandal.  The resolution was initiated solely by the Senate. But as a practical matter, it is part of a joint effort with the House to secure Swiss bank records. Those records are needed to understand transactions behind U.S. weapon shipments to Iran as well as covert arms shipments and money funneled to Nicaraguan insurgents.  Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, also has been frustrated in securing the documents; even if he is successful, he has told investigators he won't share the information with Congress because of commitments to Swiss authorities.

       " 'WSJ870320-0029': 'Apparently in Response to U.S. Pressure --- By Yoram Kessel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AEROSPACE (ARO) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Israel said it will downgrade its ties, especially military, with South Africa, apparently in response to U.S. demands that it review its policy toward Pretoria.  The lower-profile policy, which includes a promise not to conclude any fresh defense contracts and to reduce cultural and tourism links, was decided Wednesday night by the inner cabinet of 10 senior Israeli ministers and confirmed yesterday in the Knesset, Israel\\'s parliament, by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The policy switch appears motivated more by a desire to placate Washington than a belief that it will help end white domination in South Africa.  \"We shall gradually reduce our relationship with South Africa following policies that other democratic countries pursue,\" Mr. Peres said in speech. He stressed that while Israel unreservedly condemned racism in South Africa, it could \"not lead and we are not going to lead a world policy toward South Africa. At the same time we are not going to remain outside of a world policy as it is formulated by {democratic} countries.\"  Israeli leaders apparently recognize that their previous statements denouncing apartheid on moral grounds no longer suffice and that the receipt of valuable military aid from the U.S. could be in jeopardy because of a State Department report, due April 1, that is expected to name Israel as a major exporter of weapons to South Africa. That would put Israel on the spot; under terms of the congressional Anti-Apartheid Act of October 1986, countries that sell weapons to South Africa stand to forfeit U.S. aid.  Israel, the largest recipient of U.S. aid, receives $1.8 billion in military assistance out of an overall annual military aid package of $3 billion. \"We have taken U.S. opinion into account,\" Mr. Peres told the Knesset.  \"We simply cannot afford the risk of another wrangle with Washington at this time,\" one official said in an indirect reference to the strained relations over the Iran-arms scandal, in which Israel played a part, and the recent sentencing of U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard as an Israeli spy.  Officials in Pretoria hadn\\'t any official comment on the Israeli move, but politicians and commentators said it was understandable, given U.S. pressure on Jerusalem. \"Israel, like South Africa has been among the pariah nations . . . and whatever military link was forged between the countries was because of this,\" the pro-government Citizen newspaper commented in an editorial. \"It is vitally important for both South Africa and Israel that they are not estranged from each other because of U.S. blackmail.\" Because South Africa produces 90% of its own weapons, Pretoria officials seemed more concerned about a cutoff of nonmilitary Israeli goods than arms, analysts said.  Before Wednesday night\\'s decision, Foreign Minister Peres had been pushing for Israel to fall into line with Western European states, but both other men in the governing triumvirate -- Prime Minister Yitshak Shamir and Defense Minister Yitshak Rabin -- had argued firmly against a major shift.  Mr. Shamir argued that while Israel condemned apartheid vigorously on moral grounds, it couldn\\'t afford to neglect the interests of South Africa\\'s 115,000 Jews, always close friends of Israel. (The Citizen, in its editorial, noted that South Africa was one of the first countries to recognize Israel and that the South African Jewish community had been allowed to maintain financial ties with Israel despite South Africa\\'s stringent control over foreign investments.)  Mr. Rabin had been swayed by the arguments of a powerful defense-industry lobby, which maintained that thousands of jobs could be lost if defense contracts were summarily curtailed. Needing to make its home-based arms industry economically viable, Israel has long adopted the approach of selling arms to any government that wanted them. Consequently, arms exports amount to more than $1 billion annually.  But Mr. Rabin and Mr. Shamir lined up with Mr. Peres in Wednesday night\\'s decision, with only Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister and currently industry and trade minister, arguing against sanctions. \"American attitudes, especially given the mood in wake of the Pollard sentencing, weighed heavily with both Shamir and Rabin\" one cabinet source observed.  The new policy isn\\'t clearly delineated. It stipulates that no new defense contract will be signed. But Mr. Peres refused to respond to reporters\\' questions on how long existing arms-export contracts with South Africa will run.  Military censorship precludes mention of the precise amounts involved in such defense contracts or what they involve. But foreign estimates say that existing arms contracts with South Africa are worth between $200 million and $500 million annually and involve the transfer of technology more than weapons. In the Knesset, Mr. Peres rejected as \"baseless slanders\" a claim by a Communist member about alleged Israel-South African cooperation in the production of nuclear weapons.  The government also wouldn\\'t elaborate on any other sanctions that will be instituted. But officials say they probably will involve limiting trading, cultural and scientific ties.  An important element of the trade relationship is coal. Israel imports $112 million worth of South African coal annually for its electricity-generating plants. But Mr. Peres said coal from China could be subsitituted for the South African coal. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0028': 'On Tax Break For Oil Producers --- By Stephen Wermiel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) NATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN> Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposal to restore a tax break for domestic oil and gas producers is limited in scope and would cost the Treasury much less than earlier estimates have indicated.  In a news briefing, Mr. Herrington said that \"a reasonable\" proposal to restore the oil-depletion allowance would involve only new oil wells and wells using \"enhanced recovery\" methods to get oil that is particularly hard to extract.  He said this limited 27.5% annual depletion allowance, which excludes old wells, would cost the Treasury $200 million in net tax revenue each year. He said other estimates, ranging from $2 billion in a recent Department of Energy report to $7 billion in industry estimates, were too high.  One department official said an explanation for the difference in the estimates may be that Mr. Herrington was using a net figure, taking into account that increasing domestic production would generate other taxable revenue, rather than the gross cost of the depletion allowance.  Mr. Herrington said the depletion allowance is just one of several options -- aimed at increasing domestic oil production and reducing imports -- that may be discussed at a White House domestic policy meeting today.  He said that although the White House was \"cool\" to the idea of altering tax laws after last year\\'s big tax bill, an Energy Department report released this week may force the Reagan administration and Congress to look at the proposal seriously. The report said that increased reliance on oil imports presents a threat to U.S. national security interests.  The oil-depletion allowance permitted companies to deduct 27.5% of the value of oil produced from wells until 1975. Major oil companies lost the break in 1975, and the allowance for independent producers has fallen to 15% since then. ',\n",

Floersheim denied links to companies and individuals named by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a huge insider-trading case, involving a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executive.  Mr. Floersheim, president of E&amp;C Trading Ltd., a Zug, Switzerland, trading firm, said yesterday that he had \"never heard\" of Nahum Vaskevitch, a top London official of New York-based Merrill, until the SEC named Mr. Vaskevitch as a defendant in its action last week. He also said he doesn\\'t have any ties to another defendant, Israeli businessman David Sofer, nor to Plenmeer Ltd. or Meda Establishment, two companies also charged by the commission. Mr. Floersheim hasn\\'t been accused of any wrongdoing.  The SEC alleged that Messrs. Vaskevitch and Sofer masterminded an insider-trading scheme that netted $4 million in illicit profits, using accounts at Plenmeer and Meda. In its charges, the commission claimed Mr. Floersheim was a \"long-time associate\" of Mr. Sofer who, according to Mr. Sofer, had a \"financial interest\" in Plenmeer.  Merrill Lynch\\'s London banking unit loaned more than $1 million to finance 1985 purchases by Mr. Floersheim of Ampal-American Israel Corp. It made the loans while Mr. Floersheim and Mr. Sofer were waging a hostile proxy fight against Ampal, a New York company that invests in Israel.  In a telephone interview, Mr. Floersheim said that Mr. Vaskevitch didn\\'t have a role in securing the loans. He also said he never shared trading profits or had a joint account with any of the parties that the SEC named as defendants. He said his only dealings with Mr. Sofer were during the proxy fight, staged unsuccessfully for seats on Ampal\\'s board.  A Merrill Lynch lawyer in London said Wednesday that the firm was investigating the loans to see whether they were linked to Mr. Vaskevitch. Yesterday, however, William Clark, a Merrill Lynch spokesman in New York, said investigations into the loans were completed \"weeks ago,\" and had turned up \"no association with Vaskevitch.\"  Mr. Floersheim has declined to give testimony to the SEC in its investigation of Messrs. Sofer and Vaskevitch. The SEC said it can\\'t subpoena Mr. Floersheim, a Dutch citizen, because he lives in Switzerland.  Mr. Floersheim said an Israeli businessman who knew Mr. Sofer approached him in 1984 and asked him to participate in the proxy battle and the purchase of Ampal shares. \"The figures looked good, and I said I\\'d play ball,\" said Mr. Floersheim. \"But that\\'s it.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870320-0018': '--- Rural Voters See Botha and His Ruling Party As Weak-Kneed Liberals --- By Roger Thurow Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> On Faan Lemmer\\'s side of the Soutpansberg Mountains, where the Limpopo River separates white South Africa from black Zimbabwe, there\\'s only one thing worse than the drought that has ruined his farm. It is all those liberals in government who are ruining his country.  \"They\\'re giving away South Africa,\" fumes Mr. Lemmer. \"Everyone is pushing them around. That\\'s the way it is with liberals, you know.\"  Many words have been used in many places to describe the government of President P.W. Botha, but liberal usually isn\\'t one of them. To most of the outside world, Mr. Botha is a stubborn hard-liner, resolutely resisting the forces of change that are wrenching his country. But in some parts of South Africa, mainly the rural ones, Mr. Botha and his National Party are despised as weak-kneed liberals who have backtracked too far on the principles of apartheid and surrendered too much to those pushing for black majority rule.  The intensity of these right-wing feelings here is an indication of the deepening polarization within South African society. The political and emotional divide has always been great between the various color groups, but it is now widening even among the whites. As the May 6 white election nears, ideological unrest is raging on both the right and the left.  Here, in the shadow of the Soutpansbergs, the view of Mr. Botha is particularly harsh. The white farmers, the Boers who once were the backbone of National Party support, have become as unforgiving as the cruel weather. Many of them now pledge their allegiance to the Conservative Party, which campaigns under the slogan \"Stop inflation, reject integration, save the nation.\"  Such rhetoric, aimed at the Afrikaner heart, is finding an easy mark here in the northernmost corner of South Africa, where international sanctions and the domestic recession are making it even harder than usual to eke out a living from the parched soil. The farms are plagued by all manner of predators, the worst being the anti-apartheid terrorists who slip across the Limpopo by night, leaving land mines and taking cattle.  The farmers are convinced that the forces of black-majority rule, which turned neighboring Rhodesia into Zimbabwe in 1980, are camped literally at their doorsteps, ready to storm South Africa and wipe out everything they have achieved.  \"A black man has never ruled a country and can\\'t rule a country. The same will be proven here,\" says Mr. Lemmer. He\\'s in a particularly bitter mood these days: Last year, 25 head of cattle were stolen by raiders from across the border; later, he sold off the rest of his stock as the drought persisted. Gesturing north toward the country he still calls Rhodesia, he adds, \"The blacks over there are starving. P.W. Botha talks about power-sharing, but it will end up like over there.\"  Thomas Langley, the area\\'s Conservative Party member of parliament, whose farm is a long stretch of dirt road away from Mr. Lemmer\\'s, says his constituents are \"strong-minded people who know what they want.\" And that, he says, is a government that will put the blacks in their place and reassert South Africa\\'s interests abroad.  Such harsh views bother Pieter Vorster, the National Party organizer in the Soutpansberg constituency. \"This is a crucial time in our history, for the Afrikaners are divided as never before,\" Mr. Vorster says. \"Here, we\\'re battling the right. The Conservatives are fanatics. They are always the rebellious ones, against any change no matter what it is.\"  The Conservatives\\' rebellion began in 1982, when they split from the National Party and formed their own political movement. This revolt shattered the Afrikaner power monolith that ruled the country since 1948, opening a way for the unabashed expression of Afrikaner nationalism.  As South Africa\\'s racial conflict intensified, support mushroomed for the new pro-apartheid Conservative Party, as well as for the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, an extreme right-wing group dedicated to preserving white domination.  Today, the Conservative Party claims about 15% to 20% of the white electorate and holds 18 seats in the 177-seat parliament. Its influence on the government, however, is much greater than its size would indicate, political analysts say.  \"The government knows that it can\\'t leave these people behind. After all, they are all Afrikaners,\" explains a former South African diplomat who now runs a private business. \"P.W. Botha won\\'t move forward without the right wing.\"  As a result, the National Party has put the brakes on its cautious program -- initially designed to appease the country\\'s liberals -- of dismantling some aspects of apartheid. The state president and top cabinet officials have become more bellicose, belittling domestic opponents and threatening foreign ones. The government imposed its state of emergency last June partially to satisfy right-wing demands. And it called an election for May 6 in the hope of recapturing the conservative ground.  In so doing, the National Party touched off a wave of left-wing dissension that is causing some of the more enlightened Afrikaners to defect to the campaigns of independents or candidates of the liberal-minded Progressive Federal Party. And on the right, the government\\'s tough talk is being drowned out by the even tougher talk of the Conservatives. Although the National Party is in little danger of losing its big parliamentary majority, it most likely won\\'t get the resounding endorsement it is seeking.  \"The National Party is trying to do the impossible by appealing to the right and appeasing the left,\" says Connie Mulder, a leading member of the Conservative Party. \"But a middle-of-the-road party never succeeds in South Africa.\"  Which is why the Conservatives are steering far to the right. No attempt is made to hide their support of grand apartheid, as they loudly advocate a \"partition\" scheme which would put each of the black tribes in a designated area where they could rule themselves. Nor do they try to hedge their deep conviction that the Afrikaner identity must be defended at all costs, even if it means bloodshed.  \"Integrated power-sharing is suicide and that is why it\\'s out for whites,\" says Mr. Langley.  At his headquarters in Louis Trichardt, the biggest town in the constituency, there is an atmoshpere of urgency. Koeks Terreblanche, the Conservative Party campaign organizer, says the National Party is leading the country into a future of one-man, one-vote, and must be stopped -- quickly. \"Time is short,\" he says.  At the religious video shop directly below the Conservative Party offices, a similar message is heard -- this one urging sinners to repent before it\\'s too late. The store is filled with tapes of Jimmy Swaggart, the American television evangelist who preaches that old-time religious values are the only road to salvation.  \"Mr. Swaggart is very popular here, particularly with the Afrikaners,\" says Elma van Niekirk, the shopkeeper. \"He doesn\\'t beat around the bush like the liberals. He goes straight to the heart.\" ',\n",

Big Board short interest rose 2.5%, or 11,203,287 shares, to 459,393,918 shares. A year earlier, short interest was 318,624,104 shares. Big Board short interest set a record in the month ended last Nov. 14 of 469.1 million shares.  The American Stock Exchange said short interest rose 4.3%, or 1,359,233 shares, to 32,772,671 shares from a revised 31,413,438 shares. A year earlier, short interest was 24.9 million shares. Amex short interest reached a record 37.2 million shares in the month ended last July 15.  A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock. While a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock\\'s price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.  The seller in a short sale expects a price decline that would enable the purchase of an equal number of shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven\\'t been purchased for return to lenders.  Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitrage.  In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company\\'s stock is to be exchanged for that of another, or for a new issue, in a proposed merger. The profit opportunity arises when the stocks sell at disparate prices.  An arbitrager may make a per-share profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.  A number of utility stocks recorded some of the highest percentage gains in short interest last month. Short interest in Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., for instance, rose ninefold. Other utilities with high percentage increases in short interest include Tucson Electric Power Co., Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co., Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. and Idaho Power Co.  Utilities have been underperforming the stock market lately, notes Philip B. Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Advest Inc., a Hartford, Conn.-based brokerage firm. \"That\\'s what I call smart shorting,\" Mr. Erlanger said.  Short-sellers in American Motors Corp. might not be feeling so brilliant. The company had the month\\'s highest short interest volume -- 12 million shares. Chrysler Corp. recently agreed to buy American Motors for about $4 a share.  The level of negative betting increased last month, despite the bull market. The Big Board short interest ratio was 2.61 times average trading volume, compared with the previous month\\'s 2.22.  Adjusted to remove issues that are subject to arbitrage and examining those issues that are fully \"at risk,\" the ratio for the period rose to 1.66 times average daily trading volume from 1.46 last month. The adjusted ratio is designed to reflect the degree of pessimism in the short interest figures.  The increase in short interest while stock prices are also rising \"gives the stock market a strong base,\" Mr. Erlanger says. \"Euphoria isn\\'t a problem.

Terms of the agreement were settled last fall, but the signing was delayed by wrangling among the banks. Such haggling is likely to change the way new bank loans are made to distressed big debtor countries.  Several smaller banks were reluctant to lend more money to Mexico because they consider the country a poor credit risk. Some creditor banks still aren\\'t committed to the Mexican loan, and the loan books will remain open for several more weeks. During the past few days, senior officials of BankAmerica Corp., Citicorp and other big banks have been telephoning many small banks, trying to persuade them to lend the last $100 million of the loan package.  Because of these difficulties, such loans may be structured differently in the future, to get a broader consensus among banks and to offer them lending options.  The bank advisory committee system -- used in major country debt agreements since 1982 -- isn\\'t working well and also could be modified, many bankers and debt negotiators say. Under that system, a group of about 10 or 12 of the biggest bank lenders negotiate an agreement with the borrowing country, and then get other creditor banks to ratify it.  \"I think there are ways this {process} can be speeded up, by giving banks more options so they don\\'t all have to participate in exactly the same fashion,\" said Mark Walker, a partner at the New York law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton and an adviser to Mexico. He says new ways must be found to improve the consensus among bank lenders.  Many bankers agree. \"I think there are some indications there could be a change in the process; people are exasperated this {Mexican loan} has taken as long as it has,\" said a senior banker at a major U.S. money-center bank who requested anonymity. Another U.S. banker who also sits on an advisory committee questioned the present committee system: \"The Russian slang word for committee roughly translates into a dog with four hind legs,\" he said.  The $7.7 billion of loans to Mexico have a maturity of 12 years. They include $6 billion in new loans and $1.7 billion of contingency loans. The contingency loans include $500 million to be lent if Mexican economic growth slumps and $1.2 billion to be lent if Mexican export receipts fall dramatically.  All $7.7 billion carries an interest-rate margin of 13/16 percentage point over the cost of funds.  Banks contribute to such new loans for distressed debtors according to the percentage of a country\\'s debt they held when its debt difficulties arose.  Argentina is the next challenge. Its major bankers probably soon will start cajoling the country\\'s 360 foreign creditor banks to contribute to about $1.5 billion in new loans. But big banks and the Argentines are wary about the time this may take. \"It\\'ll probably be sometime between July and September before we get the money we need for this year,\" says Jose Luis Machinea, the Argentine central bank governor.  The banks and the Argentines therefore are discussing possible ways to get quicker commitments from many smaller creditor banks. The Argentines have estimated that 96 of their foreign creditor banks hold a total of only 1% of the country\\'s $34.4 billion foreign bank debt.  The country\\'s total foreign debt, including money owed to other governments and international agencies, is $49.8 billion, according to Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.  --- Brazilian Aide Asks to Quit RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- The chief foreign debt negotiator at the Brazilian central bank, Antonio de Padua Seixas, has asked to resign, but it\\'s not clear whether his request will be accepted.  Sources close to the bank said the bank\\'s governor, Francisco Gros, was trying to persuade Mr. Seixas to remain in his post. But Mr. Seixas, unhappy with Brazil\\'s debt moratorium and particularly with the scant contacts with international banks since then, seemed determined to leave.  An experienced negotiator and a friend of Fernao Bracher, the former central bank governor, Mr. Seixas is widely respected among New York bankers. His departure would probably accentuate the widespread sense among these bankers that no accord to end the Brazilian moratorium is likely to be found soon. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0009': 'Benedict Arnold Was Generally Maligned --- He May Have Been a Traitor, But His Defenders Stress The Rest of His Record --- By Bob Davis Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Maybe Benedict Arnold wasn\\'t such a bad guy after all.  Sure, he plotted to sell out West Point to the enemy back in 1780 and then set fire to New London, Conn. But maybe he has been misunderstood all these years.  Then again, maybe he hasn\\'t been. But a dedicated band of Arnold buffs think so anyway. They make pilgrimages to the sites of his battlefield triumphs and prowl musty libraries for their hero\\'s artifacts, but they aren\\'t making much headway. Defending Benedict Arnold \"is like trying to redeem Genghis Khan,\" says William Stanley, a stockbroker who comes from Arnold\\'s hometown of Norwich, Conn.  It is hard to love a traitor, especially one as obnoxious as Benedict Arnold. A short, vain man with a hawk nose and an explosive temper, the Revolutionary War general was quick to take offense -- he fought three duels -- and was obsessed with money. He also ratted to the British on his friend George Washington, nearly causing his capture.  But Arnold also was one of America\\'s greatest warriors. He saved the Colonies three times from British assaults, built the first American fleet and trekked through the Maine wilderness to invade Canada. He was shot twice in the left leg and limped in pain until his death. \"There\\'s no doubt Arnold was a traitor,\" says Willard Wallace, an Arnold biographer. \"But there\\'s also no doubt he was a bloody, blooming hero.\"  Vincent Lindner, a narrator of industrial films, is one of Arnold\\'s most loyal defenders. Mr. Lindner lives in a drafty 1770 farmhouse in Scotch Plains, N.J., that boasts three Benedict Arnold portraits and a Benedict Arnold flag. He prints Benedict Arnold stamps and has handed out Arnold Society cards that read, \"Dedicated to the belief that Major General Benedict Arnold was a loyal, dedicated officer.\"  In 1973, Mr. Lindner petitioned the Pentagon to reopen a court-martial conviction of Arnold for misuse of public property. \"It was a smear job,\" he says. The Army quickly dismissed his plea, but that hasn\\'t slowed him down. He paid $1,600 to install a stained-glass window honoring Arnold in the London church where the general is buried, and now he is finishing a novel, called \"The Diogenes Project,\" about the court-martial.  Mr. Lindner says he plans to sue the Army for Arnold\\'s back pay -- a sum he reckons is worth slightly more than $1 billion now. Asked for comment on the activities of Mr. Lindner and other Arnold buffs, a Pentagon spokesman jokingly replies: \"Have you tested these people for sanity?\"  Rejection is a way of life for Arnold\\'s army. George Estee, a retired Dover, N.H., security guard, spent seven years compiling a petition to pardon Arnold, which he says President Carter returned \"without a word.\" Billy Menna, the mayor of Ansonia, Conn., several years ago planned to have Arnold\\'s remains shipped to Connecticut from London, but he dropped his quest after complaints by residents of New London, which Arnold burned to the ground in 1781.  Audrey Wallace, a retired New York Racing Association office worker, is having better luck. She and a distant Arnold relative in Britain expect to win approval from the Westminster City Council this spring for a historical marker on Arnold\\'s London home. Miss Wallace, who lives down the road from Arnold\\'s greatest battlefield victory, in Saratoga, N.Y., says she has traveled to England 15 times largely to do research on Arnold. A few years back, she even had tea in Arnold\\'s old study -- then an apartment rented by an Indian couple.  Now Miss Wallace is hard at work on an Arnold biography, and she has compiled an inch-thick chronology of Arnold\\'s daily activities. \"If I want to know where he was any day of his life, I flip through it,\" she says.  Arnold\\'s foremost act of treason was scheming to deliver his command at West Point to the British for the equivalent of $500,000. But his plot was foiled by American highwaymen who captured a British spy carrying plans for West Point\\'s fortifications, plans that Arnold had provided. Realizing that his scheme would soon be uncovered, Arnold fled his West Point home minutes before George Washington was due for breakfast.  After serving as a British officer for the duration of the Revolution, Arnold made his way to London. Later he founded trading businesses in the Canadian wilderness and the West Indies. While on a trading mission in Guadeloupe, he was captured by the French during a dispute with the British; he escaped by bribing his guards and rowing through shark-infested waters. He died at age 60, heavily in debt and suffering from asthma and edema.  Most historians attribute Arnold\\'s treachery to greed and jealousy; throughout his career, less competent officers were promoted over him. But to his defenders, that is only part of the story. They say Arnold feared that the French would invade if the Colonies defeated Britain. They claim that his second wife was a British spy who seduced him for the British. And they add that he was justified in trying to end an unpopular war. \"It was like Vietnam,\" says Mr. Lindner.  Even Ronald Arnold, Benedict\\'s great-great-great-grandson, doesn\\'t buy such arguments. Mr. Arnold, a school administrator in Peace River, Alberta, Canada, named his son John Benedict Arnold. (Thirteen-year-old John Benedict says he considers his middle name \"kind of neat\" and especially good for shocking history teachers.) But as for his infamous ancestor, Mr. Arnold says simply, \"The man was guilty as hell.\"  So far, Benedict Arnold\\'s hometown of Norwich hasn\\'t taken its native son to heart, either. His only preserved possessions are a key to his house and a half-foot section of banister. The city also refused to buy the site of Arnold\\'s homestead when it went on the market a few years ago. Instead, a retired policeman bought the property and built a ranch house with yellow aluminum siding and fake brown shutters.  But a few people in Norwich think Arnold got a raw deal. Mr. Stanley, the stockbroker, is one of them. He works out of his basement, which is outfitted with a computer terminal, ticker tape, two Benedict Arnold portraits and a proclamation by Arnold explaining why he defected to the British. As a high-school student, Mr. Stanley says, he was suspended for two days for writing a paper celebrating Arnold as \"the most important American who ever lived.\"  Now 57, a bulky man with ruddy skin and a full head of white hair, Mr. Stanley looks more like Tip O\\'Neill than Benedict Arnold. Even so, he has portrayed Arnold twice on local television and figures he has given 150 talks on Arnold around Connecticut. \"You\\'d swear Benedict Arnold came out of the grave and occupied Bill Stanley\\'s body,\" says Joseph Levanto, the superintendent of Mr. Stanley\\'s old high school.  Resurrected or not, Mr. Stanley is a good PR man for Arnold. He inspired Claude Pelanne, a Boston television producer, to pitch a TV miniseries on Arnold\\'s life to WCVB in Boston. (WCVB hasn\\'t decided yet whether to proceed.) Now Mr. Stanley and Mr. Levanto are hopeful that Norwich can be persuaded to build a statue to Arnold in its renovated harbor area.  \"Up in Salem they honor witches,\" Mr. Levanto reasons. \"Why can\\'t we honor Benedict Arnold?\" ',\n",

Lauderdale, Fla., for spring break, swinging robins head north to Community College of Beaver County, Pa.  For the past week, dozens of robins have been bellying up to branches of a half-dozen flowering plum trees in the campus courtyard, downing wrinkled, fermented plums. And getting drunk.  \"They\\'re staggering around, flying into windows and diving into the ground,\" says John Rizzo, vice president of business affairs at the Monaca, Pa., campus. But \"we haven\\'t seen any ice packs for their heads, yet.\" Some administrators, noting that the same thing happened last spring, are pushing for a Diving Under the Influence law.  So far, none of the robins are flying upside down, but a couple have fallen from their perch in the trees. That doesn\\'t stop the party, though; they simply eat the plums on the ground.  Mr. Rizzo says someone threw bread out to the birds, hoping it might soak up the alcohol in their tiny bodies. The bread is still there, untouched.  Experts say birds don\\'t seem to suffer any physiological problems when they tie one on. (\"None of them have bad livers as far as I know,\" says Lindsay Clack, an aviculturist at the Pittsburgh Aviary.) The main problems seem to be smashing into windows or landing on the ground beak first. The tipsy birds may also fall victim to a curious cat or hungry hawk.  But once the fruit is gone, the problem is gone. \"It\\'s like people who get smashed once a year on New Year\\'s Eve,\" says Paul Zeph of the Atlantic region of the National Audubon Society. Adds Kenneth Parkes, senior curator of birds at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History: \"They pull out of it the same way humans do.\"  Still every spring, when hungry flocks return north to find overly ripe berries and fruits left from last autumn, ornithologists receive reports of drunken birds falling off fence posts. The most vulnerable are the fruit-eating robins and waxwings.  Mr. Zeph says he gets calls from worried but amused bird lovers with fruit trees or grape vines in their backyards. \"It\\'s a riot to watch,\" Mr. Zeph says. \"A lot of people look forward to it. It\\'s like an annual event.\"  But Mr. Clack, the aviculturist, doesn\\'t see what all the fuss is about.

       " 'WSJ870320-0007': '--- By Jean Marie Brown Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> U.S. farmers and farmland investors looking for a lift in wheat prices this year won\\'t get any help from Moscow.  The Soviet Union, usually the second-largest purchaser of U.S. farm products after Japan or the Common Market, is likely to continue to shun U.S. grain markets in coming months, further depressing wheat prices, grain merchants and economists say.  Despite a flurry of rumors that sparked a recent surge in wheat futures prices, many experts say the Soviets aren\\'t likely to reenter U.S. grain markets on a large scale this spring. Their absence may contribute to futures price declines of as much as 24% to 31% by July, says Richard Loewy, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.  A near-record harvest has curtailed the Soviets\\' overall import needs. And they\\'ve already bought much of the grain they require from other countries -- at prices far below those offered in the U.S.  In fact, many expect the Soviets to violate their long-term grain agreement with the U.S. for the third year in a row. The agreement requires Moscow to purchase at least 8.5 million metric tons of U.S. grain and soybeans annually, including a minimum of four million metric tons each of wheat and corn.  The Soviets may buy the required amount of corn by the Sept. 30 deadline; Washington confirmed a purchase of 1,250,000 metric tons yesterday, bringing total Soviet purchases so far this season to 2,250,000 metric tons. But, barring a U.S. offer to subsidize wheat sales, the Soviets are likely to turn their backs entirely on U.S. wheat, most analysts and economists say.  That would be bad news for U.S. farmers and policy-makers, who in the past decade became increasingly dependent on Soviet purchases as other markets dried up. Moscow\\'s foray into world grain markets in the 1970s touched off a boom in East-West commerce that peaked two years ago, when the Soviets purchased a record $2.7 billion of U.S. grain.  That year, 17% of all U.S. wheat exports and roughly one-third of all U.S. corn exports were bound for Soviet ports. Largely because of the Soviets\\' recent absence, U.S. wheat exports so far this year are lagging 19% behind last year\\'s dismal level.  Of course, the Soviets have surprised U.S. analysts before. Last month, when some experts had all but given up hope for any sales to Moscow, the Soviets purchased U.S. corn. It was the first such purchase in nearly a year and sparked the recent spate of rumors.  Many do think that the Soviets would buy U.S. wheat if they were offered subsidies under the U.S.\\'s export-enhancement program, and industry and congressional leaders have been pushing for such an offer. But the administration, still smarting from the Soviets\\' rebuff of a similar subsidy offer last fall, has resisted making a new one.  \"I\\'m very discouraged about Soviet-American relations. I don\\'t think they\\'re going to be buying,\" says John Chrystal, an Iowa banker who has advised the Soviets on agriculture for 25 years.  Barring a subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices simply aren\\'t competitive, most experts say. In recent months, Argentine wheat has been selling for as much as 25% less than U.S. wheat, the Agriculture Department says. \"Why (should the Soviets) pay more for U.S. wheat when they can go someplace else?\" asks John Urbanchuk of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.  Moreover, recent policy changes and technological improvements have slashed Soviet grain import needs some 13% this year, the Agriculture Department says. In 1985, the Soviets began a major push to better coordinate the use of fertilizer, chemicals and equipment on their best land. Partly because of that push, last year\\'s grain crop was the best in eight years.  The Soviets are also making better use of forage grasses, thereby reducing their need for imported livestock feeds, experts say. \"We\\'ve seen livestock numbers increase faster than feed demand has increased. It\\'s an indication that they\\'re using things other than wheat and coarse grains,\" says Mr. Urbanchuk.  Such policy changes may slash future Soviet demand for grains, casting another shadow on the U.S.\\'s long-term export outlook. Some grain merchants predict total Soviet grain imports over the next five years will hover around 25 million metric tons -- well below their average over the last decade. And, barring catastrophe, they are likely to turn to the U.S. as little as possible, analysts say.  \"I don\\'t think we\\'re even the residual supplier any more,\" says Laurie Law, a Soviet analyst with E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. in New York. \"We\\'re the supplier of last resort.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0006': 'To a Phone Policy Benefiting Comsat --- By Bob Davis Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) </IN> The Federal Communications Commission proposed to eliminate, over the next decade or so, a key international telephone policy that benefits Communications Satellite Corp.  The policy, called balanced loading, requires American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to use satellites owned by the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization for about half its overseas calls. Comsat, a satellite company based here, owns 25% of Intelsat, a 113-nation consortium that has a near monopoly on international satellite communications.  The FCC started its balanced-loading policy in 1966 to ensure that AT&amp;T gave some of its business to the fledgling Comsat, rather than route all its calls on AT&amp;T undersea cables. At the time, satellite transmission was considered a cheaper form of communications than cable.  But now, with the emergence of fiberoptic technology, transmitting telephone calls by cable may cost less than satellite transmission. At the same time, Intelsat has kept its rates high on certain high-volume transmission routes, such as the North Atlantic, in an effort to subsidize communications to countries with less telephone traffic. As a result, critics contend, requiring AT&amp;T to transmit overseas calls by satellite inflates rates for consumers.  \"We hope to speed the days when we\\'ll have a more competitive environment,\" said FCC Chairman Mark Fowler. Page Montgomery, vice president of Economics &amp; Technology Inc., a Boston consulting firm, said the FCC plan \"would drive down costs in the North Atlantic region.\"  The FCC\\'s balanced-loading policy expires at the end of next year. The agency voted 5-0 to seek comments on three replacement policies. One would eliminate balanced loading immediately in 1989, and the other two would phase it out over as long as 12 years.  The agency appears to be leaning toward phasing out the policy. Top FCC staffers and commissioners have said it was necessary to move slowly in order to keep Intelsat and Comsat afloat. \"It may be possible to gradually step away (from balanced loading),\" Mr. Fowler said in an earlier interview. \"It would be a gradual cut and would give Comsat time to diversify.\"  Jack Hannon, vice president and general counsel for Comsat\\'s world systems division, said he views the FCC action positively because of its \"strong message of support\" for the Intelsat system. \"It\\'s clear that the FCC is looking for a reasonable transition period,\" he said. \"It wants to make sure that the marketplace is ready to handle total flexibility before it removes itself from the loading process.\"  AT&amp;T said it was \"encouraged\" by the FCC plans, but it added that it had a \"long-term commitment to satellites.\" William Thaler, a Georgetown University professor of telecommunications, predicted Intelsat would survive the change because demand for overseas calls has increased and because the consortium plans to launch a new generation of communications satellites. Intelsat officials didn\\'t return calls seeking comment.  Comsat shares closed yesterday at $33.75, off 25 cents, and AT&amp;T at $23.125, off 25 cents, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Separately, Albert Halprin, chief of the FCC\\'s common carrier bureau, said he would resign sometime in the next few months. He and Mr. Fowler, who is leaving sometime this spring, plan to go into business together. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870320-0005': 'Investors Wary Of Stock Plans For Directors --- By Jill Bettner Special to The Wall Street Journal</HL> Stockholders of some major corporations may find a new item on the agenda for this spring\\'s annual meetings -- a management proposal to give stock options to outside directors.  So far, perhaps only 5% of large firms pay outside directors partly with stock options or other equity grants, says Peter Chingos, a principal at accountants Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. But he and others say that such sweeteners, which come on top of the cash retainers and daily allowances non-employee directors usually get for attending board and committee meetings, are a growing trend.  \"Many companies are looking for more innovative ways to attract good talent to their boards,\" says a spokesman for Data General Corp., a Westboro, Mass., computer company that introduced stock grants for outside directors three years ago. Adds a spokesman for Monsanto Co., a St. Louis-based chemicals and pharmaceuticals company that also adopted an equity plan for outside directors in 1984: \"There\\'s been a recognition generally in management circles that it\\'s a good idea for directors to have a financial stake in the corporation. This is one way of doing it.\"  Some investors, however, see cause for concern. Although they support the idea in principle, they say stockholders could end up paying too much for board members at a time when certain holders are already being forced to give up some prerogatives. Under new laws that limit directors\\' liability, shareholders of companies based in Delaware and some other states have lately forfeited their right to sue directors for some forms of negligence.  Jamie Heard, deputy director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, says a few plans have been too generous. A good plan can help align \"directors\\' economic interests with those of stockholders,\" he says. But with \"give aways,\" such as stock options at below-market discounts, directors profit whether or not the company prospers.  Greta Marshall, investment manager of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which has most of its $42 billion in publicly traded securities, says she would question \"the true independence of directors when they\\'re receiving sizable benefits and perks from the very management they\\'re supposed to be overseeing.\"  Some investors also say that giving significant equity to outside directors could reduce some companies\\' per-share profits and, thus, lower the prices of their stocks. But to date, at least, the small amounts of stock involved causes only minimal shareholder dilution at companies with several million shares outstanding.  Equity awards for outside directors may include options on a few thousand company shares, a similar amount of restricted stock or stock-appreciation rights -- so-called \"phantom\" shares, which let holders participate in any capital gain in the company\\'s stock without actually owning it. Typically, the awards are granted when the outsider joins the board and can be exercised upon departure. If there is a takeover, however, most plans vest outsiders immediately.  Some companies also give annual awards. At Monsanto, for example, non-employee board members get $5,000 of restricted stock each year, along with a $20,000 cash retainer and $1,000 for each meeting they attend. The company plans to double the stock award this year. (While most companies have put the issue to a shareholder vote, Monsanto won\\'t -- saying it isn\\'t legally required to do so.)  Will the promise of bargain equity cause reluctant outsiders to rush to the boardroom? Vernon Jordan, a Washington lawyer who serves on the boards of eight major corporations -- including the publisher of this newspaper, Dow Jones &amp; Co., which doesn\\'t have such a plan, and Corning Glass Works, which does -- thinks the answer is no. \"People who care about being a director aren\\'t going to make a decision one way or another based on whether the company gives them restricted stock,\" he says.  Still, such plans can be attractive for outsiders, says New York lawyer Frederick Bruenner, a director of National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp., another company that gives equity to non-employee directors. The plans \"are a good way to compensate directors whose duties clearly have expanded over the years in terms of the level of care required and their exposure to this litigious society,\" he says.

       " 'WSJ870320-0003': 'Swissair Order Of $650 Million --- By Judith Valente Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AEROSPACE (ARO) AIRLINES (AIR) </IN> McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it received a $650 million order from Swissair for six of its MD-11 wide-body jets and options to acquire a dozen more.  The European airline\\'s decision represents a major victory for the St. Louis-based aircraft maker, which has been trying to build a strong base of orders for the new version of the DC-10. It also deals a blow to Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that has been battling McDonnell to stake out the market for a new generation of jumbo jets. Airbus hasn\\'t yet made a final decision whether to build its proposed competitors in that market segment: the A-340 and the A-330.  A Swissair official said the airline chose the McDonnell jet over its chief Airbus rivals largely because of the MD-11\\'s earlier delivery date. He said McDonnell would finish its first Swissair jets in May 1990, while Airbus\\'s earliest proposed delivery date is 1992.  The Swissair official also said the airline was heavily involved in the planning of the MD-11 and that McDonnell had been willing to meet certain specifications that the airline wanted, such as enlarging the plane\\'s rear cargo door.  The airline intends to use the new MD11, a long-distance jet, on several of its nonstop international flights, including Chicago to Zurich and Boston to Zurich. Depending on the seating arrangement, the MD-11 can carry between 276 and 405 passengers as far as 6,600 nautical miles.  Swissair is the fourth airline to sign purchase contracts for the new jets. McDonnell said it has received orders and options from 17 customers for 119 of the planes.  Although potential purchasers include several large foreign carriers, such as Alitalia, British Caledonian Airways and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), McDonnell has yet to land an order from a major U.S. airline -- an accomplishment aircraft analysts believe is critical to the long-term success of the jet.  An Airbus spokesman in Washington said that nine airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, had made commitments to buy 104 A-330s and A-340s. The two versions seat between 260 and 330 passengers.  \"We\\'re sorry to have lost the Swissair sale,\" the spokesman said. \"It\\'s a blow, but not a serious enough blow that we won\\'t launch the aircraft program.\" Airbus, which is supported by the governments of France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, estimates the A-330/A340 development program will cost $2.5 billion.  Airbus and McDonnell both face fierce competition from the industry leader, Seattle-based Boeing Co. Boeing makes the wide-body 747 and 767 models used by several domestic carriers. It has 85 orders on hand for its two-engine 767-300-ER and 773 orders for all models of its four-engine 747.

Mr. Smith, a narcotics detective nearing the end of a six-month undercover operation here, was in a local bar when two men grabbed him and pulled him into the restroom. \"We\\'ve got some serious problems with you,\" said one man, from whom Mr. Smith had bought marijuana just the week before. The man accused him of having given secret testimony about local drug dealing to a grand jury, describing in detail testimony that the detective had, in fact, just given.  Mr. Smith strenuously denied it, and managed to get out of the place. He began sleeping with two loaded pistols by his bed. Yet, hoping the leak was confined to a narrow circle, he decided to continue infiltrating the local drug culture until the appointed bust.  That was early yesterday. And though not all went as planned, the operation reached a climax with a 5:30 a.m. series of arrests. As a confrontation earlier in the night would show, Mr. Smith had stayed under cover until the last possible moment.  Though the war on drugs now often is waged with speedboats, planes and sophisticated tracking devices, its front-line soldiers still are faceless detectives like Mr. Smith. These are not television cops; no sound track accompanies a marijuana buy in Mason, Ohio. Their work, as a week spent with Mr. Smith near the end of the Mason operation shows, involves danger and ethical dilemmas, but it also entails mind-numbing hours of inactivity and humiliating rejections by two-bit dealers they are trying to befriend in pool halls.  \"Undercover work is the most difficult, exposed, dangerous assignment the public asks one of its representatives to take,\" says Peter Bensinger, a former head of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency. \"It isn\\'t always glamorous, high-tension, high-rolling, high-money transactions. It is repetitive, dull, tedious and very frustrating.\"  Going undercover also can impose a burden in terms of a detective\\'s sense of himself. Outfitted like a deadbeat, he must get used to people subtly reacting to him as such -- to a mother, for instance, holding her children close as he passes by. He must get used to the constant edginess that threatens to develop into paranoia.  When it all gets to be too much for Mr. Smith, he sometimes stands before a bathroom mirror in his seedy room. \"I am Gary Smith,\" he says aloud to the scruffy figure peering back. \"I live in Wisconsin. I have a wife who loves me, and a house. I will make it.\"  Mr. Smith\\'s assignment in this quiet community of 10,000 near Cincinnati began last September. Town officials, wanting to ferret out drug dealers but mindful that local detectives would be recognizable, hired a detective agency to supply an undercover man at $5,000 a month. That agency, Mr. Smith\\'s employer, is Professional Law Enforcement Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, one of a growing number of security firms offering such services.  Using the cover of a traveling errand boy for a rich father, Mr. Smith (his real name) immersed himself in the town\\'s drug culture, sharing \"roach clips\" with dealers, courting drug-hungry women and haunting darkened streets and bars into the wee hours. No one in Mason was told of his identity except the police chief and his two staff detectives.  He fights the drug wars unarmed but well-defended by his wits and a knack for blending in. A 32-year-old college graduate and former policeman, he looks more like a drifter in his flowing beard, black Panama hat and baggy clothes -- the same ones often worn for days on end. Anyone can dress the part, but Mr. Smith is blessed with a particularly convincing feature: bad teeth. The overall effect is unsettling; \"Gary looks nuts,\" says an agency administrator, Gary Vest.  Mr. Smith likes undercover work because the only thing that counts is results. He leaves far behind the politics and paper-shuffling that he hated about standard police work. Still, he lives with some irksome restraints. Mason\\'s budget, for example, is so tight approval is needed for any drug buy of over $200.  \"It\\'s exasperating,\" he says. \"I mean, we\\'re never going to stop the flow of drugs at this rate. I\\'ve got to spend all this time with small buys and second-rate dealers just to have a chance at getting up the ladder.\"  In such an environment, sampling illicit pleasures is also a constant temptation; last year more than 300 undercover officers nationwide were themselves arrested on drug and other offenses. Mr. Smith worries about his drinking habits; to do his job well, he must repeatedly spend long evenings knocking back beers with drug dealers and users.  \"We have to be priests,\" says Mr. Smith, \"yet a sex maniac and a drug addict at the same time.\"  In some ways, working in towns like Mason is more challenging than similar work in, say, New York City. In New York, a senator seeking to prove a point can buy \"crack\" from strangers on a street corner, but here a detective can buy only from people he has gotten to know. \"In these small towns, people have known each other practically since birth,\" says Edward Probst, a PLE supervisor. \"They\\'ve all gone to school together. It\\'s tough to infiltrate that.\"  Yet the danger is still there. The recent murder of a teen-age girl in a Mason park is unsolved but suspected of being drug-related. Another PLE agent, working in another Ohio town, recently found himself pinned to the ground by a wild-eyed drug dealer with a knife who \"told me if I was a cop I was dead meat.\"  A week in the life of Gary Smith, accompanied by a reporter he introduces as an old friend, illustrates some of the highs and lows of small-town undercover work.  Friday Shortly after 7 p.m. on a freezing night, Gary slides into his black Sunbird and pops a cassette into the tape player. \"Let\\'s roll,\" he says, as, to the pulsing sound of the theme from \"Miami Vice,\" he peels out of the gravel parking lot.  Tonight\\'s focus is a 28-year-old drug user mentioned by several people with whom the detective struck up conversations. Two nights ago Gary met her by a simple but unorthodox maneuver: He walked to her front door and introduced himself. Flashing a roll of $100 bills seemed to help break the ice.  Through this woman, whom we will call \"Julie,\" Gary has met a dealer from the Cincinnati area, a fast-talking man in his mid-20s whom we will call \"Mike.\" He has ordered a quarter-ounce of marijuana and some Valium pills, to be delivered this night at the cramped, littered apartment of the woman\\'s sister and brother-in-law -- across from the Mason police headquarters. While they wait for the dealer to arrive, Gary and his hosts sip beer and watch Donald Duck cartoons.  Before long \"Mike\" breezes in, a blondbearded young man in a red sweatshirt. From his wrist hangs a yellow plastic K mart shopping bag filled with Baggies of marijuana and a colorful assortment of pills.  \"Good news, bad news, dude,\" the dealer cheerfully tells Gary. \"I got the quarter, but I need the V\\'s for later.\" Gary hands over $35 for a banana-shaped packet of marijuana and arranges to buy the Valium the following week. No questions, no hassle: the best kind of drug buy.  But now he can\\'t just walk out; \"Julie\" and the others expect to get at least a little high. A joint is rolled and passed around. And Gary, having asked to buy the dope, can hardly decline it.  This presents several problems. At least some of the drug must be saved as evidence of the buy, evidence he will turn over to the police as soon as possible. Moreover, the detective knows that taking drugs, besides violating the law, is against his employer\\'s policy and a sure way to ruin a case against the dealer.  And it will be known whether he has indulged; PLE agents must take lie-detector and drug tests after each operation. So when the joint comes his way, Gary takes the smoke into his mouth without inhaling, the hot fumes rasping at the back of his throat before he slowly exhales. His reporter friend does the same.  The sister of \"Julie,\" holding a baby in one arm, takes the joint and sucks in deeply. Thick smoke settles softly over the family\\'s three sleepy children. \"I try not to keep much pot around the house, just my personal stash,\" the brother-in-law says between drags. \"You know, the kids and all.\"  Most undercover operations target neither Colombian drug lords nor Mafia capos, and Gary\\'s are no exception. To \"climb the ladder\" to big dealers, detectives have to begin with factory workers, housewives, teen-agers and businessmen -- often family people with sad stories and everyday worries. Says William Taylor, PLE\\'s president: \"When the old lady fixes you dinner and you start playing with the kids, that\\'s when you start feeling a little guilty. You realize that if you do your job, you\\'ll break up a family.\"  Few tasks bother Gary more than \"working\" female sources. \"I love my wife very much,\" he says, before setting out this evening. \"I couldn\\'t do anything out here without her.\"  He goes to great lengths to maintain a healthy marriage; every Saturday night he begins an 11-hour round-trip drive to his home in Wisconsin. He returns each Tuesday, locking his life and love in a gray-metal strongbox in the trunk of his car. Inside the box are police manuals, log books recording his activities, pictures of his wife -- and his wedding ring. All this weighs on him when, at a raucous bar later this night with \"Julie,\" Gary rests his hand in the small of her back and, in the din from a heavy-metal rock trio, strokes her hair. She places her hand on his knee.  Driving home, Gary asks the woman to accompany him to Florida in April. \"I hope we can share it together,\" he says, and the two hold hands above the car\\'s stick shift. At evening\\'s end, he walks her to her front porch. In the darkness they embrace.  \"You know,\" Gary says, returning to the car, \"in another world, another time, she might have been somebody.\"  After stops at two Mason bars, he returns to his room at 3:30 a.m., then walks outside to a pay phone to call his wife. In 20-degree weather, he talks with her for more than an hour.  Wednesday Five nights later the dealer and a promised Valium buy are nowhere to be found. The evening seems wasted until \"Julie,\" like some drug-culture Avon lady, volunteers to go door-to-door among friends in search of marijuana. \"This is the kind of night I love,\" Gary whispers later as she scampers to a door. \"Look at all the places she\\'s taking us. Think of all the people we\\'ll meet.\"  Only when it seems all the friends will pile into his car at once does the detective get irritated. \"This is getting to be a three-ring circus,\" he mutters at one stop. By 10 p.m. he is escorting three self-described potheads to what seems like the 20th Ohio town in search of marijuana. Finally, a biker in nearby Lebanon provides a quarter-ounce for $45.  It has been a lot of work for such a tiny payoff; Gary, not having seen the buy occur, can only tip police or hope to buy from the biker later. Most narcs don\\'t dwell on the fact that they aren\\'t making much of a dent in the national drug nightmare. \"Remember,\" Gary says at one point as a drug dealer approaches his car, \"if we don\\'t make the deal, no one cares. No one cares at all. No dope deal is worth getting killed over.\"  After the biker buy, Gary wonders aloud why the other dealer didn\\'t show. \"He might think you\\'re a narc,\" says \"Julie\" matter-of-factly. \"But that\\'s stupid. I wouldn\\'t show no narcs around. Besides, he hasn\\'t known you as long as I have.\" It has been exactly one week since they met.  Thursday A light snow is falling as Gary follows the blue sedan into the bustling streets of nearby Hamilton, Ohio. There, at the home of one of Mason\\'s two regular detectives, he updates the town\\'s police chief. Gary has been \"under\" so long he has forgotten the chief\\'s name.  It is James Edwards. Mr. Edwards smiles as the undercover man reels off names of the dealers he has bought drugs from. \"You\\'re leading us into an inner circle we\\'ve been trying to get at for years,\" the chief says.  Peter Schultz, one of the town\\'s detectives, says, \"We\\'re not naive enough to think this will end our drug problem, but it\\'ll make dopers think long and hard the next time they sell another joint.\"  That night Gary and \"Julie\" find their no-show dealer at a Mason house. He is regaling friends by telling how he supposedly beat drug tests at his workplace by swallowing a mixture of water, fruit juice and aspirin. Though temporarily \"dry,\" or out of inventory, \"Mike\" agrees to help Gary buy Valium or marijuana from a dealer at a nearby pool room.  Once there, Gary orders a beer, chalks up a cue stick and gets to work. Between games of eight ball, he disappears outside with the youthful new dealer, returning 10 minutes later with another quarter-ounce of marijuana. Two hours later, the two again disappear, this time into a dank, concrete-block bathroom, returning minutes later with more marijuana that Gary says is for a friend. He ducks out a third time to secretly jot down the license plate of the new dealer\\'s car. During a fourth trip he sets up a Valium buy with \"Mike.\"  By 2 a.m. the narc and the two young dealers have become pool-playing, back-slapping, beer-drinking buddies. At one point, as the three lean on their cues between games, snippets of conversation can be heard through the din of a jukebox.  \"We could do it. We could do it. He\\'s cool. He\\'s cool.\"  \"Could we really buy a whole ounce?\"  \"Five-fifty? Man, what a price!\"  \"You\\'re blowing my mind! You\\'re blowing my mind!\"  By closing time Gary has arranged his biggest deal yet in Mason, agreeing to supply more than $500 to help the two young men buy an ounce of cocaine for $2,000. Smiles abound as the three walk outside into falling snow. On the drive back to Gary\\'s tiny room, the car radio blares an anti-drug song called \"Smuggler\\'s Blues\":  It\\'s a losing proposition, but someone had to lose.  It\\'s the nature of the business.  It\\'s the smuggler\\'s blues.  Yesterday morning at 5:30, more than 40 officers from several Ohio law-enforcement groups began arresting some three dozen suspected drug dealers and users named in about 100 indictments -- one indictment for every 100 inhabitants of Mason. Most were were roused bleary-eyed from their beds.  The arrests climaxed an otherwise dismal night for Mr. Smith and the Mason police. After two scheduled drug buys had fallen through by 1:30 a.m., Mason detectives made plans to raid an after-hours party at a local bar, where they hoped to find drugs and maybe \"roll\" some dealers, that is, coax them into cooperating. But Mr. Smith, inside the bar with another agent, was again heatedly accused of being an undercover agent. At 2 a.m., Mason police received an urgent call from his partner. \"I think you better come get Gary out -- now,\" he said.  Ten minutes later, eight Mason and PLE detectives with pistols drawn burst in and lined up the 25 or so patrons against the bar. They also arrested and handcuffed Mr. Smith, mindful that blowing his cover now might jeopardize the arrests scheduled for three hours later.  That didn\\'t convince two patrons, who continued to accuse Mr. Smith of being a narc. So the handcuffed detective suddenly charged one of the men, flailing with his shoulders and kicking until pulled away. \"I thought someone would stop me,\" Mr. Smith said later, \"so I kicked him.\"  Later yesterday morning, Mr. Smith stood in the Warren County Jail and watched as more than 20 of his drug sources -- among them \"Julie\" -- were brought in in handcuffs. Many gaped or stared when they saw a badge hanging from Mr. Smith\\'s neck. Not one uttered a word. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0152': 'The Main Line Murders --- By Benjamin J. Stein</HL> What on earth is wrong with people? What internal and external mechanisms of the most minimal common sense and even self-preservation are lacking in human beings?  In the late 1970s, in the Main Line suburb of Upper Merion, Pa., there were many strange people. One was William Bradfield, a middle-aged teacher at Upper Merion High School. He was obsessed with Ezra Pound, a Svengali figure to a number of women teachers, and perhaps a bisexual. He established relationships with a number of weak-willed colleagues, stray particles even in the constrained world of Upper Merion. He told them about Helen of Troy and about \"The Cantos\" and then he stroked his beard, and they were amazed. One woman became his live-in girlfriend and turned over practically every cent she had to his fanciful endeavors. She stayed loyal and devoted to him even after he openly had affairs with other women and with schoolgirls (although whether any of his affairs went beyond cuddling is not clear).  A second strange guy was Jay C. Smith. Mr. Smith, an \"educator,\" was for a time principal of Upper Merion High School. According to colleagues and friends, he had the eyes of a goat, and sexual tastes to match. While he was principal he would sometimes break into the class via the public address to meander through an extemporaneous speech filled with sexual innuendo. He was a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, well read, and might just have murdered his daughter and son-in-law to get their drug rehabilitation checks. He did dress up like a Brinks guard and rob a Sears store in suburban Philadelphia at Christmas time.  These are the main characters of an extraordinary true story, which the press labeled the Main Line Murders, rendered hypnotically in Joseph Wambaugh\\'s new book, \"Echoes in the Darkness\" (Perigord Press/Morrow, 416 pages, $18.95).  Unfortunately this is just the beginning of what we learn about Bradfield and Smith. Most of the rest has to do with their incredibly complex, occluded, and ultimately incriminatory plans to murder Susan Reinert, a pitifully confused woman, and her young children.  How Bradfield and Smith murdered the Reinerts is still unknown. What is known -- largely as the result of a slogging, tireless quest by a policeman named Jack Holtz who saw the case to its conclusion -- is that they did it for insurance money. Ms. Reinert, a disciple of Bradfield, apparently believed she and Bradfield were about to be married, and had obtained $700,000 of life insurance in his favor. Bradfield and Smith worked out a cunning but ultimately futile crosslinked set of excuses for one another so that neither would be able to be clearly matched to the time or scene of the crime.  But what is most striking is that all of the people around Bradfield and Smith were almost unbelievably, maddeningly, mind-bogglingly stupid. Mr. Wambaugh\\'s work is a peculiarly American variant of Hannah Arendt\\'s epic about Eichmann in Jerusalem and the banality of evil. Mr. Wambaugh\\'s book might well be subtitled \"The Stupidity of Evil.\"  For example, male teachers who were colleagues of Bradfield helped him to hide huge sums of cash, wipe fingerprints off hundred-dollar bills, build silencers for pistols, file serial numbers off guns, and hide typewriters -- always without any good explanation (as if there were good explanations).  Female acolytes, college graduates, helped Bradfield make up excuses for seeing other women, lied to the police about his whereabouts, drove around cars for him without reason, and listened to the most insane drivel as reasons without once noticing (apparently) that they were behaving like cattle.  Mr. Wambaugh\\'s meticulous, spellbinding book tells about people who had gone to college and were trusted to teach the children of the middle class, but who could not sense any danger in a colleague walking around with a silenced pistol, suddenly showing up with sacks of hundred-dollar bills, endlessly telling them that people they knew were about to be murdered. This is a book about men and women who should have heard wild alarms going off around them, and instead dared to eat a peach, about people who know Ezra Pound but who do not know enough to call the cops.  The beauty of this book lies in Mr. Wambaugh\\'s deadpan piling on of an unbearable weight of evidence as to just how degenerated we are as people when nuts and killers like Smith and Bradfield can wander among us openly telling us of their plans while we watch like helpless, spotlit deer. Mr. Wambaugh is furiously angry that people this dumb allowed Karen and Michael Reinert to be killed (probably brutally) before they reached age 10. He is angry enough to end his book with a shriek -- and an eloquent shriek at that -- about how a new generation just as stupid is already coming along; a generation that will forget even the lessons of Ms. Reinert and her children.  \"Echoes in the Darkness\" is carefully wrought, important reading by a brilliant and angry man. By mixing that personal feeling of rage with his always-fluent style and his cop\\'s powers of detail, he has given us not just a book about a crime, but a dizzying book about who we are as a people.  --- Mr. Stein is a lawyer, economist and writer in Los Angeles.

       " 'WSJ870319-0139': 'You Back; Maybe It\\'s a Birthday --- By Andrea Rothman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Perhaps Lee Iacocca should have seen it coming.  Before Henry Ford II fired him as president of Ford Motor Co. in 1978, Mr. Iacocca should have realized that Donald E. Petersen, then an executive vice president, would eventually grab the top spot at Ford. The reason? Mr. Ford and Mr. Petersen share the same birthday, Sept. 4. Mr. Iacocca was born Oct. 15.  Just a coincidence? Not according to James Uffelman, a 43-year-old computer specialist with a theory about corporate succession.  Mr. Uffelman established his theory while developing a line of birthday cards that list birth dates of famous people. In poring over the 28,000 names in his data base, Mr. Uffelman says he began noticing \"certain trends,\" including the fact that chairmen and their successors often share the same or similar birthdays.  At Du Pont Co., for example, former chairman Edward G. Jefferson and his predecessor, Irving S. Shapiro, share a July 15 birthday. At Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Chairman Arthur Hauspurg\\'s birthday is just two days before that of his predecessor, Charles F. Luce.  Lynn Palmer, an astrologer and author, says such trends make sense, since companies need leaders with the same \"sun signs\" that influence governing abilities.  Curiously, though, companies where the birthday phenomenon occurs seem blind to its significance and contend that birth dates are meaningless in choosing leaders. \"At Ford Motor Co. performance is what counts,\" says spokesman Tom Foote. Birthdays \"have no bearing on management policies for advancement.\" If the coincidence was acknowledged at all, he says, Messrs. Ford and Petersen \"probably wished each other happy birthday.\"  At Du Pont, \"the answer is no,\" says spokeswoman Faith Wohl, as to whether the firm uses birthdays in making appointments. \"We are a scientific company,\" she says. As for Con Ed, \"All the company wants to say,\" says a spokesman, \"is, we don\\'t consider the calendar when making executive appointments.\"  Mr. Uffelman, who is president of Technimetrics, a New York data company, says he isn\\'t surprised corporations seem unwilling to consider the merits of his theory. \"I suppose it really (would be) on the fringe of what one would call normal, prudent judgment\" to let birthdays become part of personnel decisions, he says.

Although Hong Kong\\'s courts have acted before to safeguard assets within Hong Kong, they had never extended their rulings to foreign assets.  The judgment means that Asean Resources can\\'t dispose of its 42% holding, valued at the equivalent of about $12.9 million, in a Singapore company, Ocean Front Pte. Ltd. The court said it acted because it believes the men who run Asean Resources have already \"plundered\" its resources in Hong Kong and that it\\'s necessary to prevent them from \"plundering the Singapore company in the same way.\"  The court acted in response to a request by representatives of Ka Wah Bank. Three Malaysian businessmen used loans totaling $27 million from the Ka Wah Bank group to finance their takeover of Asean Resources in 1985. Those loans are in default. The Ka Wah group also lent heavily to Asean Resources itself and is currently owed more than $13.4 million by the company. That debt also is in default.

       " 'WSJ870319-0137': 'Yank Helps Brits Avoid Non-Dairy Sundaes --- By Terry Trucco Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> When Bill Blackburn, an advertising executive from Chicago, moved to London 24 years ago, he couldn\\'t stand the place. It was damp. It was dreary. It was inefficient. And the ice cream was terrible.  That last discovery really hurt. Mr. Blackburn, 57 years old, still gets misty-eyed describing the homemade peppermint ice cream he ate as a kid and helped crank whenever his parents gave a dinner party. \"Good ice cream has to be rich,\" Mr. Blackburn says with a connoisseur\\'s fondness. \"The fat must come from cream and butter, and you need a lot of it.\"  Yet in a land of dairy surpluses and dessert lovers, in a nation that slathers its crumpets in clotted cream, the ice cream somehow managed to be thin, tasteless and, inexplicably, creamless. The lethal ingredient was \"non-dairy fat,\" as the English call it, which usually means the vegetable fat liberally used in lieu of cream. Even that was a big improvement over the postwar years. Because of rations and shortages, English ice cream was fashioned from such tantalizing substances as whale lard and bacon grease. \"Lard ice cream,\" groans sociologist Owen Rossan, an American expat who first tasted the stuff in 1964. \"If ever the sun shone, it would never drip on you.\"  So after a decade here, Mr. Blackburn made a decision. He didn\\'t want to leave England, where his family was happy. And he wasn\\'t ready to air-ship his favorite flavors from the U.S. So he started an ice cream business, using an all-American recipe, heavy on the milk and cream. He rented a modest factory in Western England, designed a chipper red, white and blue carton, and tested flavors (he started out with chocolate, vanilla, Vermont maple pecan and, of course, peppermint). And he dubbed the whole thing New England Ice Cream. \"New England\\'s the part of America I like best, and I thought it might stand for quality in English people\\'s eyes,\" he says.  Dessert fans with a memory insist the situation has improved. These days several companies turn out bona fide ice cream made from all the proper ingredients. In fact, a couple years after Mr. Blackburn invented New England, another American, a former stockbroker, launched Dayvilles 32 Flavors, which aped the all-American multiflavor concept and judiciously abstained from bacon fat.  But much of the stuff that gets plopped on cones, stirred in shakes and scooped onto waffles is a blend of such lip-smacking ingredients as whey powder, glucose syrup, skimmed milk, sugar, artificial flavorings and, of course, vegetable fat. And few Brits seem to mind. \"Food just isn\\'t part of the culture here, and that goes for ice cream,\" sighs Mr. Rossan.  Oddly enough, ice cream was part of England\\'s culture long before Americans had ever licked it. A royal banquet in 1387 included a promising-sounding concoction called creme frez. And in 1750 \"The New Universal Complete Confectioner\" printed an ice cream recipe. Ice cream is still a staple of royal banquets, though food critics routinely skewer Buckingham Palace menus for lack of imagination.  Fourteen years in the ice cream business has convinced Mr. Blackburn that Brits can still learn to love the real stuff. \"I don\\'t think tastes in Britain are different from tastes in the U.S., although I think Americans have a somewhat richer palate,\" he says, poised over a hot fudge sundae at the snappy tile-walled soda fountain he and his late wife, Susan, opened at Harrods department store a few years back. As proof he scans the customers bellying up to the soda bar, a comfortable mix of Sarah Fergusonesque Sloane Rangers and American tourists.  The notorious British fondness for sweets may eventually develop into a taste for super-rich ice cream, too, Mr. Blackburn believes -- and hopes. \"At 14% butterfat, our ice cream was considerably richer than any other when we started out, and now we\\'re up to 15%,\" he says in professorial tones. (America\\'s superduper-rich ice creams are a vein-clogging 18% butterfat.) His company, which now boasts 13 ice cream and sorbet flavors, finally turned a profit three years ago and should chalk up $3 million in sales this year. \"And I\\'m not much of a businessman,\" he adds. \"I just like ice cream an awful lot.\"  The fun part of the job is product testing, and dapper Mr. Blackburn has gained 20 pounds in the process. (His favorites include his Colombian coffee, which has crunchy coffee grains mixed in; a sinful pralines and cream; and double chocolate chip, a new flavor.) He\\'s also gotten a little help from his new Ice Cream Academy, a group of 35 foodies and friends who regularly receive a dozen or so tubs of New England Ice Cream and report their findings. Last fall the academy, whose members include author Len Deighton, actor Ian McKellen, journalist Godfrey Smith and a gaggle of English food writers, met at a big London art gallery for a blind tasting featuring nine brands of ice cream from Britain, Italy and the U.S.  As the champagne flowed, blobs of ice cream were dispersed, followed by bland biscuits to erase the taste. (With no spittoons, the tasters could dispose of their samples as they saw fit.) And the results? New England and Marks &amp; Spencer Luxury, an elegant English concoction, beat out seven other vanillas, including Haagen-Dazs. Vanni of Italy won the chocolate competition, followed by New England and Ben &amp; Jerry\\'s.  Mr. Blackburn\\'s background has made him an ideal, if offbeat, ice cream pioneer. A Princeton graduate, he went into the advertising business in Chicago following a stint in the Army, where he saw a bit of action at the tail end of the Korean War. His specialty was launching new products, which included a disposable diaper called Pampers (the rest seem to have gone the way of most new products). He also handled accounts for several ice cream makers, including the American Dairy Association and Coldwrap Ltd.  As a son of one of the founders of the Kraft Food Inc., he also knew a thing or two about the dairy world, though he insists the family business was never a big attraction. \"When I was about 11 years old, my whole class was taken to see a film about the company called \\'The Romance of Cheese.\\' But cheese didn\\'t seem very romantic, and I didn\\'t have much interest in going into that.\"  Mr. Blackburn became sufficiently serious about the ice cream business in 1977 to fold his advertising firm and concentrate on dreaming up and marketing new flavors. His next plan is to open a chain of American-style soda fountains, complete with counters, stools and a generous scoop of nostalgia. Though drugstore soda fountains were never a big part of Britain\\'s past, the locals have seen enough movies to know the genre. \"I make ice cream. But what I\\'m really selling is American culture,\" Mr. Blackburn says.  --- Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer based in England. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0133': 'In Spite of Plunge in World Oil Prices --- By Mark M. Nelson Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> When Adolphe Demeure de Lespaul died unexpectedly nearly two years ago, the corporate culture he had nurtured as chairman of Petrofina S.A. quickly began to fade.  It was a culture that shunned attachments to the giant holding companies that control much of the rest of Belgium\\'s economy, a culture that put independent industrial success above all else. When asked in 1984 what he thought of joining forces with one of the holding companies, the strongwilled Mr. Demeure rolled out his most damning insult: \"We are industrialists, and they are financiers.\"  But since his death, the financiers have come close to satisfying their long-held longing for this gem of the oil industry. The two holding companies, Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A., together have become Petrofina\\'s biggest shareholders with a stake of more than 18%, and they hold six of 18 board seats. This month, they launched an effort to boost their stake indirectly, through an unusual tender offer for a portion of Britain\\'s Imperial Continental Gas Association, which owns 7.2% of Petrofina.  The main reason for Petrofina\\'s allure has been its performance after the plunge in oil prices that began in 1985. While much of the oil industry struggled to keep from sinking along with prices, the world\\'s No. 15 oil concern quietly continued to churn out profits like clockwork as it had for two decades. Net income increased 7.6% last year, to the current equivalent of $483 million.  Chairman Jean-Pierre Amory explains the company\\'s success in one word: flexibility. He boasts about its tiny central organization of only 400 people for a company that has 200 affiliates and 22,700 employees and sales of $17.37 billion in 1985, the latest year for which revenue figures are available.  Whether the convoluted strategy of Belgium\\'s two big holding companies will succeed isn\\'t clear. Even though they increased their stake in IC Gas to 22.2% through their offer, which closed Monday, the price of IC Gas shares has continued to rise, leading to speculation that another bidder may emerge.  But clearly the Petrofina secret has come into the open. Many observers say that is why last year Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp. of the U.S. made an unsuccessful bid for IC Gas, and why Petrofina is on plenty of wish lists.  Few have been able to penetrate Petrofina\\'s inner circle to discover just how the company does so well. Analysts say Petrofina is tight-lipped about both its successes and its failures. \"It\\'s just what its name says,\" observes Sue Graham, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. in London. \"Petrofina S.A. -- \\'Societe Anonyme\\' -- the anonymous society.\"  Petrofina won\\'t say where it makes its profits or where it buys its oil. It won\\'t disclose how much it makes on production of crude oil and how much on refining and chemical manufacturing. Some analysts think it has a special trading department that specializes in seeking out the best deals and making fast decisions on the world\\'s crude-oil markets. Others think the company bought a huge reserve of oil when the price bottomed out and will use it only after the price rises.  \"But you won\\'t see any of that mentioned in the annual report,\" says Marc de Brouwer, an analyst at Peterbroeck van Campenhout &amp; Cie. in Brussels.  One thing is clear: Petrofina has developed a profit orientation that pervades all aspects of the company -- from its oil fields in Africa, the North Sea and North America to its 11,000 Fina service stations in 16 countries in Europe, North America and Africa. Since 1978, profits have risen an average of 15% each year without a decline.  \"As long as they do that,\" says David Johnson, an oil analyst at London merchant bank Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co., \"they don\\'t have to explain too much.\"  One of Petrofina\\'s central strategies is to have plenty of cash to handle emergencies and make quick decisions. \"Petrofina is the most remarkable company I\\'ve ever met,\" says Ms. Graham, the Merrill Lynch analyst. \"It stuffs money away like there\\'s no tomorrow.\"  The treasure trove certainly helped the company in December 1985 to jump on Charterhouse Petroleum PLC, the British oil company, which it acquired for $230 million. And it helped again late last year when Petrofina grabbed the oil and gas interests of Williams Cos. of the U.S. for an undisclosed price.  Mr. Amory, Petrofina\\'s chairman, says he has another $1 billion on hand for the next opportunity. \"I can write four or five checks and have my billion dollars,\" he says.  He says the company\\'s decentralized structure allows company managers to make on-the-spot decisions without being second-guessed. The company is known to have profited richly on quick purchases at good prices of low-grade crude oil, which it then filters through its highly efficient refinery operations and turns into high-grade products.  In 1986, Petrofina says, 15% of its sales came from chemical products, one of the highest percentages among integrated oil companies.  For all its acuity and stashed-away cash, Petrofina still doesn\\'t fully control its destiny. Fewer than 40% of its 18.2 million shares are held by identifiable parties. The other stockholders have bearer shares and never show up at company meetings lest they run into the tax inspector.  How will Petrofina come out of the big Belgian holding companies\\' battle for IC Gas? If Groupe Bruxelles Lambert and the Tractebel S.A. affiliate of Societe Generale gain control of IC Gas\\'s holding in Petrofina, the two will hold more than 20% of Petrofina shares and will be able to block any major intiative put before the board. Moreover, the winner of the IC Gas stake is expected to be able to assume IC Gas\\'s three board seats.  But if the holding companies lose IC Gas\\'s 7.2% share to an outside party, an erosion could begin of what Mr. Amory, the Petrofina chairman, describes as the \"friendly and stable\" circle of shareholders who now control Petrofina.  Mr. Amory seems to take the idea of a bigger holding by GBL and Societe Generale with equanimity. Asked whether he is worried about the prospect of their exercising greater control, he replies indirectly. \"I would be worried like hell if IC Gas were to be bought by Mr. (T. Boone) Pickens (Jr.),\" the Texas corporate raider. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0132': 'Israel\\'s Pollard Scandal: Arrogance, Not \\'Dual Loyalty\\' --- By Alexander Cockburn</HL> With the Pollards now behind bars, convicted of spying for Israel, the sky is dark with chickens coming home to roost.  American Jews nervously ponder the fact that other spies for Israel may be brought to book and fear the revival of old charges of \"dual loyalty.\" They have sent a high-level delegation to Israel to impress upon that country\\'s government the delicacy of the situation and the damage inflicted on U.S.-Israeli relations. They and others have asked how it is that the Israeli government could have acted with such careless arrogance, first to enter into such a relationship with Pollard when he volunteered his services, and finally to promote the two men identified as Pollard\\'s senior Israeli handlers, Messrs. Eitan and Sella.  The answer is simple enough. Israel, as represented by its recent governments, has acted with careless arrogance because it had every reason to believe that its carelessness would remain unchecked and its arrogance unchallenged. All the talk about \"dual loyalty,\" with that phrase\\'s undoubted anti-Semitic resonance, is something of a red herring. Anti-Semitism and McCarthyism make the accusation of \"dual loyalty\" as a matter of taste, inflicted on persons by reasons of their ancestry, or the kinds of thoughts in their heads or books on their shelves.  But the Pollards did not go to prison for something vaguely designated as \"dual loyalty.\" They agreed they had broken laws relating to espionage. There is a substantive difference, even if it is true that during outbreaks of anti-semitism or McCarthyism, Jews, communists and fellow travelers are likely to be framed on trumped-up charges of espionage on behalf of their presumed foreign masters.  So it has nothing to do with the loaded phrase \"dual loyalty\" to say that the furious resistance among many of Israel\\'s admirers in this country to any criticism of any act of any Israeli governments in recent times has inevitably fostered in the minds of many Israeli officials the notion that they can get away with anything. When it comes to reality checks, yes men are not much use. Fortified by their yes men here, Israeli officials no doubt conceived they would remain immune to sanction concerning such activities as the bombing of the U.S. intelligence ship Liberty, continued occupation of the territories, illegal settlements, sabotage of any realistic peace process, invasion of Lebanon, bombing of Tunis and so forth.  The depth of the arrogance thus produced was well illustrated by a \"Letter to an American Friend\" published in the March 10 Jerusalem Post and written by Shlomo Avineri, a well-known Israeli academic. Prof. Avineri asserted that although American Jews maintain that their position in U.S. society is now secure, their distress over the Pollard affair and concomitant charges of dual loyalty shows that their true position is in fact tenuous and they are still in need of emancipation. This is the ultimate parody of the Zionist argument: The more Zionism messes you up (by recruiting Pollard and thus provoking the charges of dual loyalty), the more this proves, says Mr. Avineri, that America is not the \"promised land!\"  The success of the yes men has produced the ridiculous situation whereby serious scrutiny and criticism of various actions of Israeli governments often can be found only in the Hebrew-language press in Israel. Here may be found even devoted yes men speaking with frankness.  In the Dec. 11 Ha\\'aretz, for example, the executive director of the American Jewish Congress, Henry Siegman, spoke candidly about the consequences for Israel\\'s interests in the U.S. of the arms-for-Iran affair, saying: \"Israel has always claimed that its security will be badly damaged by American arms sales to Jordan and other Arab states. What argument will Israel now have to oppose such arms sales? If there are arguments to justify arms sales to a country like Iran, which refuses to recognize Israel and promises to destroy it, what objection can be made to the armaments for Saudi Arabia or a truly moderate state such as Jordan. . . . If Israel can arm the Iranians, claiming that it might help to moderate them, then why should not other countries at least talk -- not sell arms -- to the PLO, in the hope that such talks will have a moderating effect on this organization?\"  In the Hebrew-language press one can find such frank talk, as well as candid acknowledgment of PLO peace overtures -- all regarded as a matter best kept from the U.S. public. Two decades of success at this kind of manipulation of news and opinion and one easily gets to the point where the Pollard affair looks like something easily brushed under the rug.  So the sooner the yes men see that critical support can be more constructive than blind enthusiasm, the better off Israel and everyone else will be -- particularly those on the receiving end of scandalous treatment by the present Israeli government, which might sit up and take heed if the yes men dared open their mouths.  To take some recent cases, Israel shut down, amid practically no public commotion in this country, two Arab papers in East Jerusalem: Al Mithaq and Al-Ahd. The charge, based on undisclosed evidence, was one of association with \"terrorist groups.\" Then Akram Haniyeh, editor of another Arab paper, A-Sha\\'ab, was expelled from Israel on undisclosed charges. An Israeli citizen, Mordecai Vanunu, charged with spying, was kidnapped in Rome and is now being tried in secret. Imagine the shouts that would have risen from the yes men if the Soviet Union or Nicaragua had perpetrated such deeds.  More recently, in another case that left the yes men unmoved, Israeli authorities have for the first time used the Prevention of Terror Ordinance of 1948 -- in origin a piece of characteristically outrageous British emergency legislation held over from the Mandate -- against an Israeli Jew. On Feb. 16, Israeli police closed the offices of the Alternative Information Center in West Jerusalem. (The offices are within Israel proper, and therefore not under military regulations pertaining to occupied territory.) The center offers news, typesetting and translating services to Western journalists, consulates and groups on the West Bank. Authorities are charging that by some unspecified means the center has been promoting propaganda of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.  To this day the center stays closed. Its leading organizer, Michael Warschawsky, was jailed for a month and reportedly released on bail Monday. In the time-scarred argot of repression, an Israeli policeman has claimed that secretly, Mr. Warschawsky and the others were planning to use the office to provide the left with instruments for advancing its objective.  It is the sort of exercise of state repression that would be headline news if it occurred in Moscow or Managua. In Israel it has caused some alarm, since the emergency laws have often been used against Israeli Arabs but not, until now, against Israeli Jews. Thus Mr. Warschawsky\\'s persecution is seen as a harbinger of a more general crackdown. The people who ordered the closing of the center and Mr. Warschawsky\\'s arrest are those who nurtured the Pollards. Who is to call them most effectively to account for such behavior if not the yes men who helped imbue them with the illusion that they would forever escape reproach or sanction.?

But London shares barely advanced as trading remained surprisingly quiet after Tuesday's budget-related bull run.  Tokyo's Nikkei stock average, which rose 99.36 points Tuesday, surged another 190.33 to 21,705.06, its second consecutive record close. It surpassed Tuesday's 21,514.73.  The stock exchange index rose 17.05 to 1874.80.  Volume was about 2.4 billion shares, up from Tuesday's 1.8 billion and more than double Monday's 1.1 billion. Yesterday's record turnover eclipsed the mark set Aug. 21, when volume was 2.3 billion.  Yesterday's bullishness was inspired either by Tuesday's gains on Wall Street or the Tokyo market's own momentum, depending on the analyst questioned. In any case, traders were optimistic that the Nikkei average will advance further this week as liquidity continues to flow into the market from Japanese tokkin funds, which are similar to U.S. mutual funds. And a feared correction in recent price surges won't take place until April, some analysts say. Others say it won't take place at all.  The unprecedented turnover, 66% of which involved the top 10 gainers, was attributed to large infusions of cash by tokkin funds whose valuations are due tomorrow.  Electric cable issues closed sharply higher amid continued talk about commercial applications of a new high-temperature superconductor refined by Japanese scientists. The technological refinement opens the way to a new generation of cables that transmit electrical power or impulses with minimal resistance.  Most brokerage houses posted only moderate gains despite the record turnover. Nomura and Nikko were up. Daiwa, though, fell on profit-taking.  Export-led electrical and computer shares were mixed to weaker. Early gains by steel issues were eroded by profit-taking, which struck here and there during the day.  Meanwhile, London shares registered very modest gains over Tuesday's record close, which came on the heels of the unveiling of Britain's fiscal 1988 budget.  The 100-share index, which closed Tuesday at a record 2006.3 and stood at 2017.2 early yesterday, closed just 0.3 point higher at 2006.6. The Financial Times industrial share index rose 2.6 to 1589.5.  The market showed early strength, buttressed by yesterday's highs in New York and Tokyo as well as London. But stocks drifted lower the rest of the day in one of the quietest post-budget trading sessions in at least one trader's memory.  Share prices already had discounted many of the budget's bullish measures, which were widely reported in advance, the trader said. Another trader cited lack of overseas demand as investors digest the budget and wait to see how the half a percentage point cut in British banks' basic lending rates yesterday affect exchange rates. In fact, there was disappointment in the market because a full percentage-point reduction had been anticipated, said a market maker at a leading securities firm.

       " 'WSJ870319-0127': 'Keeping U.S. Cotton Competitive</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Your Feb. 20 editorial \"The Cotton Club\" misleads the reader on the history of government cotton programs.  It is true that a high-loan program was initiated in the early 1940s, but a key purpose was to ensure adequate fiber for the war effort. That program continued until 1965, when Congress -- at the request of cotton people -- based cotton\\'s price-support loan on market price rather than a percentage of parity. New legislation in 1978 incorporated a similar approach. From the mid-1960s until early 1985, the market price rarely dipped even close to the loan floor but, across this whole period, averaged some 15 cents above it.  Market forces controlled cotton prices, and the U.S. share of world cotton exports rose substantially from 1965 through 1984. Cotton\\'s sharpest losses to synthetic fibers occurred at a time when their prices were two or three times higher than ours. The losses were due primarily to the strongly promoted \"no-iron\" characteristics of synthetics. In recent years, cotton has regained some of these losses through market development and research financed entirely by growers.  Only from 1985 to mid-1986 did the market-oriented loan keep U.S. cotton from being competitive, and this was primarily due to China\\'s massive increase in cotton production and the dollar\\'s unforeseen rise. The law that took effect in August 1986 -- again at the request of cotton people -- corrected this problem.  Your contention that growers are \"guaranteed a price of 81 cents a pound\" is true only for very small growers. The current limit on payments makes it impossible for growers of more than 150 to 600 acres (depending on yield) to collect the full 81 cents. The largest are guaranteed only a little above 55 cents this season, and that will drop in the future. Cotton\\'s share of total farm-program costs was less than 6% in the first year of the Food Security Act of 1985, compared with the historical average of 10%. USDA projections suggest cotton-program costs will drop by a further 50% or more over the life of the law. The cost of the cotton program is declining, production is increasing, producer income is being protected, jobs are being retained and cotton is contributing positively to the U.S. economy.  Finally, your observation that more than 10 million bales will be used domestically this year fails to acknowledge that imported cotton textiles will supply four million of those bales. Cotton textile imports have doubled in five years. If that growth rate continues, there will be no domestic market for U.S.-grown cotton in another eight years. That is why the U.S. cotton industry favors legislation that would hold textile-import growth to the rate of domestic-market growth.  The U.S. cotton industry is cost-competitive with the major producing countries, but 95% of foreign cotton production is subsidized. Our major competitors include such non-market economies as China and Russia. Without U.S.-government involvement, our markets are forfeited.  U.S. cotton production -- about $4 billion at the farm level -- is worth $45 billion at retail. Farm-program costs and reasonable trade legislation should be viewed as an investment in a viable economy.  Aven Whittington President, National Cotton Council Memphis, Tenn.',\n",

But others -- exporters, government officials, even some foreign bankers -- see signs Mexico is on the mend.  To be sure, the country remains saddled by recession and the second-highest external debt in the Third World. Inflation is roaring ahead at an annual rate of more than 100% and could worsen if monetary authorities succumb to the pre-election temptation to pump up the economy.  Nevertheless, private-sector economists who in the past had nary a kind word for the government have lately been offering grudging praise. Skeptical foreign bankers who have traveled to Mexico recently have gone away appeased. They are encouraged by the way Mexican monetary authorities responded to last year\\'s oil shock, and by the way some Mexican businesses reacted to monetary austerity.  A majority of analysts predict the economy will start expanding again this summer, albeit at a snail\\'s pace.  \"On the external adjustment, they did a much better job than anybody expected,\" says a U.S. bank economist. \"I\\'ve become a little bit more confident about {President Miguel} de la Madrid\\'s seriousness.\"  He adds: \"So far, so good. Of course, they\\'re going to have to keep the brakes on, to keep it all from draining away.\"  The mood of cautious optimism today contrasts with the gloom that prevailed a year ago. As early as February 1986, worried officials realized that the slide in oil prices would cost Mexico billions of dollars in foreign-exchange revenue.  They predicted the country\\'s current-account balance -- which measures trade in goods and services as well as certain unilateral transfers -- would swing to a deficit of $5.5 billion from 1985\\'s surplus of $500 million. They told U.S. officials they would need $9 billion in new foreign loans and interest-rate relief, and warned that if funds ran out, they would be forced to take a radical stand on the foreign debt.  \"It\\'s hard to find any other country whose terms of trade deteriorated so much in such a short time,\" says a Mexican financial official.  But the government\\'s fears never materialized: The central bank puts last year\\'s current-account gap at just $1.29 billion.  Authorities restrained the deficit, in part, by keeping domestic credit so tight that business executives had to bring back dollars from abroad to keep operations going. In addition, the devaluation of the peso made manufactured goods cheaper -- and thus easier to sell -- abroad. The result: Non-oil exports grew a bigger-than-expected $2.4 billion in 1986, to $9.5 billion.  Mexico also got some help from last year\\'s decline in international interest rates. In the end, rather than defaulting on its debt, it was able to negotiate a $12 billion package of new foreign credits. Participating banks have been arguing for months about their contributions, but they are scheduled to reach an accord tomorrow on providing as much as $7.7 billion.  One private economist, who has been highly critical of the government\\'s policies, describes its performance last year as brilliant. \"I think they may be able to get this beached whale {Mexico\\'s economy} moving again,\" he says.  Mexico will actually enjoy a temporary cash surplus if the bank loans come through as planned. But some economists wonder whether it can manage times of relative plenty as skillfully as it managed last year\\'s hardship.  \"When things look unfavorable in the outside world, we\\'re forced to do things better,\" says a Mexican monetary official. \"When there is a reversal of conditions, we seem to relax all the controls and start spending like a nouveau riche.\"  The government has been promising for months that it will loosen credit and fuel moderate economic growth once the foreign bank loans come through. The 1987 budget promises to give businesses access to 20% more credit, in real terms, than last year. Money-supply figures are already on the upswing.  \"This is what is going to scare the foreign bankers most: domestic credit creation,\" says economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O.  He worries that with factory use at about 70% of capacity, investors won\\'t put their share of the new funds into productive assets, but rather into paper ones -- including dollars. The long-awaited loan package \"is money that could flow out of the country,\" he warns.  On top of that, Mexican government officials seem determined to slow the pace of peso devaluations that did exporters so much good last year. The officials say the devaluations contribute to inflation by making imports more expensive.  The Center for Economic Studies of the Private Sector, a Mexico City think tank, says fighting inflation is the right battle, but exchange-rate manipulation the wrong weapon. Its economists wish the government instead would emphasize old-fashioned budget cutting.  They say that if the government tries to restore economic growth as promised this year, without first reducing the budget deficit sufficiently, hyperinflation will result.  Almost no private economist believes the government can meet its goal of reducing inflation to 80% this year from 106% last year. In just the first two months of 1987, consumer prices rose by 16%.  Experts also doubt the government will achieve its target of 2.5%-3% economic growth, reversing last year\\'s 3.7% contraction. But they think it can attain an expansion of 1% to 1.5% without unleashing hyperinflation -- if monetary officials keep money tight.  In an election season, when politicians have been promising growth, that\\'s a big if. Pessimists fear the government will relax the monetary reins as soon as the new foreign loans come through.  Such a course would backfire in the long run, warns a Mexican economist who says the government will eventually have to ask its foreign creditors for more relief. \"You can\\'t go back to the banks and ask for lower spreads on interest rates, or a grace period on interest payments, without taking important additional domestic measures,\" he says.  The U.S. bank economist has doubts about the Mexicans\\' perserverence. In the past, they\\'ve demonstrated their ability to make a dramatic short-term adjustment, he says. \"But have they got the capacity to sustain it in an election year? I\\'ve got to say no, they\\'ll probably blow it again,\" he says. \"But they\\'ll probably blow it less dramatically than they did before.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0117': '--- By John. C. </HL> The heat was incredible. I could hardly breathe. My muscles ached.  As an infantry platoon leader in Vietnam, I had it a little easier than some of the others. My rucksack weighed only 75 pounds or so. But when you added grenades, four or five bandoliers of M-16 ammo and machine gun ammo, it was quite a burden. But I could not think about that now.  I had other things to worry about; my mind was racing. \"Anticipate. You must anticipate,\" I kept telling myself. Where would the next ambush come from and how should I react? My eyes were wide open in search of the unknown.  As I moved my platoon of 20-odd teen-agers through the jungle, I chose to walk third in the line of march. I had no seasoned veterans with me -- no sergeants who had been through it before. Some of my \"men\" couldn\\'t even read a map. If I got hit, I reminded myself, they would have trouble finding their way back to the firebase.  My point man was some well-meaning, poor soul who was on his first patrol. He had a well-trained scout dog, which looked like Rin Tin Tin. Right behind him was Pvt. Larry Gatliff. A tall, gawky guy, Larry was special. Simply put, he was one nice kid. Innocent, polite, cooperative. He wanted everyone to \"get along.\" To defuse arguments and keep harmony among his comrades, he would dig their foxholes in searing heat after a long day\\'s march through the rice paddies. He was the kind of boy who would make any father proud.  On this day, I followed behind Larry as we walked slowly and carefully forward. Having experienced the same scene during training in Panama, I had brought one squad up on my right flank for extra protection. I was \"anticipating.\" As we proceeded up a hill, it happened.  Machine-gun fire. Screaming. Rustling. Groaning. More firing. Blood. Silence.  The scout dog ran off howling through the jungle, never to be seen again. The dog handler was shot through both legs, but was still alive. I yelled at him to fire his M-16 at the enemy.  Larry fell backward next to me. A bullet had passed through his helmet and taken off most of his head.  \"Fire!\" I screamed to the others. \"Fire! Don\\'t stop! Get those bastards.\" Bullets vibrated over my head. I could actually feel them. I was angry. It seems crazy, but I wasn\\'t scared. I was too busy.  The enemy tried to run around to our right. They always seemed to be in control. This time, however, they were too eager. Too cocky. They nearly tripped over my other squad, which was ready for them.  Minutes later, I placed Larry onto a chair that was dropped down from a Medivac helicopter hovering above. Up he went, as I stared at him. Tears filled my eyes. I had done everything \"by the book\": I had anticipated; I had used my intuition. But I had still lost him. Although my voice was drowned out by the noise of the Huey, I yelled to him, \"I\\'ll never forget!\"  Weeks and months passed. There were more ambushes. I lost several other soldiers every week. Such was the hazard of working in I Corps in 1970 in South Vietnam in the Americal Division. I made it a habit not to get close to them. I didn\\'t want to be their friend. I was their lieutenant.  I knew about My Lai, Tet and Son Tay, but I was able to forget or at least accept it. Later, I learned about Agent Orange and felt betrayed. But for some reason Larry\\'s memory kept coming back to me.  Years passed. I considered contacting Larry\\'s parents. I knew that they had been notified by a form letter and that it had been a closed casket. From my friends, I got divided opinions: Some said, \"Don\\'t contact them now -- it\\'s over, forget it; don\\'t dredge up old pain and agony.\" Others would tell me, \"If I were Larry\\'s parents, I\\'d want to know how he died.\"  More time passed. I did nothing.  Finally, on the eve of Veterans Day last year, I visited the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. As I rubbed my fingers over Larry\\'s name, I looked to my left and was surprised to see Chuck Norris standing next to me. I said I didn\\'t know he had been in Vietnam. He whispered that his brother had been there. His name was inscribed very near Larry\\'s.  While at the memorial, I learned that Larry came from Lebanon, Ore., and wondered again if I should contact his family. I decided to call. It was nearly 16 years later, but somehow I thought it must be done.  From that call, I realized the full extent of one man\\'s tragic death.  Since it had been a closed casket, doubt had gnawed at the family for all these years: It\\'s not really Larry, right? There was a mistake, wasn\\'t there? Other questions preyed on them: Did Larry die dishonorably? Was he killed by one of his own men? Was he into drugs? Did he run away? Maybe he fled to another country, ashamed to come home because of a crippling injury. Was it an accident?  I spoke with Larry\\'s mother and revealed the true nature of Larry Gatliff\\'s honor. He was, indeed, one of the best: a hero who died at a young age in an ugly war.  Later, I found out that after our discussion, Larry\\'s mother was able for the first time in 16 years to talk about her son without crying.  In some way, she had found peace.  So had I.  --- Mr. Shoemaker, a sales manager in Southborough, Mass., served in Vietnam in 1970. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0116': 'Intense public opposition to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\\'s proposed nationwide sales tax is destroying political support for the plan and derailing his legislative agenda -- and now threatens to push him from office.  Opposition to the 5% sales tax has been building since Mr. Nakasone and his Liberal Democratic Party introduced it last autumn. Anti-tax rallies now attract tens of thousands of merchants, small-business owners and even Japan\\'s normally meek consumers. A recent poll by the influential Asahi Shimbun newspaper indicated that 82% of the nation opposes the tax.  Vivid evidence of Japanese discontent came last week in conservative Iwate prefecture. After 25 years of staunch support for the ruling LDP, voters elected a Socialist, who opposes the tax, by a margin of two to one. The \"Iwate shock\" brought into the open discontent that had festered within the ruling party for months and sent LDP members scurrying to distance themselves from party support for the tax.  In contrast to the good feeling and consensus that existed after the LDP\\'s overwhelming reelection victory last July, even the deputy prime minister has called on Mr. Nakasone to drop the tax plan or risk a big loss for the LDP in next month\\'s local elections. Mr. Nakasone refuses.  The upshot: Mr. Nakasone may soon be out of a job. Politicians and political analysts say the damage done by the tax proposal leaves Mr. Nakasone few alternatives than to withdraw the tax plan and then resign, perhaps between mid-April and late May.  \"There is a saying in Japan that the lizard cuts off its tail to save itself,\" says Masayuki Fukuoka, a professor of political science at Komazawa University in Tokyo. \"LDP members are saying the head of the lizard must be cut off. Mr. Nakasone is the head. It is the only way.\"  Mr. Nakasone\\'s supporters note he has been astute enough to get out of political scrapes before. The prime minister has good reason for avoiding a showdown. Resigning before his term expires in October would deny him the capstone of his heretofore successful political career, a visit to the U.S. and to the June summit of industrialized nations in Venice.  \"He\\'s lost the chance to do all the things he wanted to do,\" says Takayoshi Miyagawa, an LDP pollster and political analyst who also says Mr. Nakasone will resign early. \"Anti-tax now means anti-Nakasone.\"  The controversy -- and Mr. Nakasone\\'s inabilty to contain it -- is especially ironic because only last July he led the LDP to its most sweeping victory in 30 years. At the time, analysts said the LDP\\'s control of more than 300 of the 512 seats in the parliament\\'s lower house would let Mr. Nakasone punch through whatever legislative measures he wanted.  Some analysts say the ill-fated tax plan may also have unpleasant effects for the \"new leaders\" of the LDP, one of whom had been expected to replace Mr. Nakasone in October. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa heads the government ministry responsible for drafting the tax bill. After his successful meetings with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker on the stabilization of the Japanese yen, Mr. Miyazawa was considered the leading candidate. The controversy also reflects badly on Noboru Takeshita, the secretary-general of the LDP, and Shintaro Abe, the chairman of the LDP parliament affairs committee, who were supposed to maintain party discipline while pushing the bill through parliament.  As taxes go, Mr. Nakasone\\'s sales tax proposal is modest. More akin to a European value-added tax than the sales tax levied by many U.S. states and cities, Mr. Nakasone says it will affect only about 790,000 of Japan\\'s six million taxpayers. It would bring in about $38.6 billion a year, at current exchange rates.  But it is complicated. The government excludes 51 categories of goods and services from the tax, about 65% of basic goods by government estimate. Sales of food, beverages, company shares or land won\\'t be taxed. The costs of a child\\'s birth won\\'t be taxed, but a funeral will. Tickets to traditional Japanese \"kabuki\" won\\'t be taxed, but performances of \"rakugo,\" Japan\\'s equally traditional comic theater will. Only companies with annual revenue of more than $660,000 have to pay the sales tax, which means 90% of retail businesses are exempt.  So what\\'s the objection of the working people? Taxes paid by the big companies will be passed through Japan\\'s complicated distribution web, meaning that small retailers -- and consumers -- will have to shoulder higher prices.  With those fears, the timing of such a tax couldn\\'t be worse. Japanese are already worried about the economy. The high yen has forced Japan\\'s export-oriented industry to cut back capital spending, and in some cases, employment. The economy grew only 2.5% in 1986, the lowest in 12 years. Unemployment is at a record 3% and could reach 3.6% by the end of the year, according to William P. Sterling, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Securities in Tokyo. Consumer spending, which the sales tax would discourage, also shows signs of weakness, he says.  In the eyes of the Japanese, Mr. Nakasone added insult to injury by solemnly promising before the July elections that he wouldn\\'t levy a large-scale indirect tax. He says he still hasn\\'t. But others see it differently. \"He lied,\" says Kunio Hatoyama, a parliament member and one of the first to break LDP ranks and oppose the tax.  \"The Japanese think they were fooled and that makes their opposition even stronger,\" says Mr. Fukuoka, the professor. \"You can\\'t expect to take money from people after fooling them.\"  But flush with the overwhelming victory in July, Mr. Nakasone and LDP leaders didn\\'t expect the backlash, leading them to think they could disregard the growing anti-tax sentiment, analysts say.  Until Iwate. \"The lopsided result shows how worried people are about the conceitedness of the LDP,\" says Rei Isurugi, the unsuccessful LDP candidate who was running to replace her late husband. She followed the party line but now says it was a mistake. \"I can\\'t forget what my husband said right before he died,\" she says. \"He said, \\'Mr. Nakasone tries to do things too quickly.\\' He tried to get the tax plan without having the people\\'s understanding.\"  The party in that northern province has learned its lesson. In the local elections that begin April 12, Mrs. Isurugi says, \"Every single person is going to oppose the sales tax.\"  That is also the trend around the country where LDP candidates face election races. But others aren\\'t so sure.  The chairman of the Socialist Party, which with other opposition parties have succeeded in deadlocking the parliament, says Mr. Nakasone is \"good at pretending to be dead. Suddenly, he will get up and dash.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0115': 'Revised to 1.1% For 4th Quarter --- Leaner Inventories Suggest Pickup in First Period; Corporate Profits Rose --- By Rose Gutfeld Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN> The Commerce Department trimmed its estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth to a meager 1.1% annual rate, but said the after-tax profits of U.S. corporations rose a healthy 6.1% during the period.  The downward revision in growth from a 1.3% pace occurred because inventory investment, consumer spending and government outlays were all weaker than originally reported. This weakness was partly offset by a further narrowing of the trade deficit and a greater increase in nonresidential business investment than were estimated earlier.  The weak expansion in the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation\\'s output of goods and services, follows growth at a 2.8% rate in the third quarter. For all of 1986, GNP increased 2.5% after a 2.7% rise in 1985.  Many economists contend growth has picked up in the current quarter, partly as a result of inventory rebuilding. Several analysts asserted that the latest revision bolsters that view.  \"A downward revision that involves leaner inventories should suggest that the beginning of the year will be even stronger\" than previously expected, said Roger Brinner, director of U.S. forecasting at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. Companies started 1987 with \"a good, lean inventory position, and any demand must call forth production,\" he said.  The report showed that prices, as measured by a GNP-based gauge known as the deflator, rose at a subdued 0.7% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same as reported last month. In the third quarter, the deflator increased at a 3.6% pace. For all of 1986 it increased 2.7% after a 3.3% rise in 1985.  The rise in corporate profits was the sharpest since an 11.4% gain in the third quarter of 1983. Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the improvement reflects cost-cutting and some additional pricing flexibility as a result of the dollar\\'s decline against major currencies in foreign-exchange trading.  He contends that economic growth will remain slow this year but expects that profits will continue to rise.  The fourth-quarter increase brought profits to an annual rate of $144.2 billion, after a 5.5% rise in the third quarter to a $135.9 billion pace. Profits rose 1.9% in all of 1986.  The department\\'s measure of profits from current production increased 2.8% to a rate of $310.4 billion in the fourth quarter, after rising 3% to a $302 billion pace in the third period. This gauge increased 7.1% for the year. This figure, which many analysts consider a better gauge of corporate financial health, is adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation on inventories and to reflect capital depreciation more accurately.  Before taxes, profits rose 7.7% to a $258.8 billion pace, after increasing 5.6% to a $240.4 billion rate. For the year, before-tax profits increased 6.4%. The department\\'s measure of corporate cash flow gained 0.3% to a $391.6 billion rate, after rising 1.3% to a $390.4 billion pace in the third quarter. Cash flow rose 3.8% in all of 1986.  The quarterly figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment for inflation, fourth-quarter GNP ran at an annual rate of $4.259 trillion, up from a $4.241 trillion pace in the third quarter.  Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:   4th Qtr.    3rd Qtr. 1986        1986 GNP ........................... 3696.1      3686.4 less: inventory change ....... -28.5        -0.3 equals: final sales ......... 3724.5      3686.7 Components of Final Sales Personal Consumption ........ 2445.8      2448.0 Nonresidential Invest. ....... 457.8       454.4 Residential Investment ....... 199.7       197.2 Net Exports ................. -148.0      -163.3 Gov\\'t Purchases .............. 769.3       750.4 In the fourth quarter, the implicit price deflator rose to 115.2% of the 1982 average from 115% in the previous quarter.

Birnbaum Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The Senate narrowly handed President Reagan a victory by voting 52-48 to release an already appropriated $40 million in military aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents.  The vote was largely symbolic, since the aid -- the final installment of a $100 million aid package previously approved by Congress -- was almost certain to be paid anyway. President Reagan would have vetoed any measure to block the funds, and the Democratic opponents of the aid couldn\\'t have mustered enough votes to override him.  The real test of the president\\'s policy of aiding the so-called Contras will come this fall, when Congress is likely to consider a new administration request for $105 million in military assistance.

Their comments were in line with the general belief that the Democratic-controlled Congress will be reluctant to extend any further military assistance to the Contras.  Opponents of the funding argued that the Contras couldn\\'t win their war and had misspent millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers\\' money. Advocates of the aid said U.S. support was necessary to protect the U.S. and other democracies in the Americas from encroachment by communists.

Compared with those of the Americans and the Soviets, Japan\\'s space accomplishments to date have been quite modest. Its space development budget for 1987 ($1.3 billion) is roughly one-eighth that of the U.S. But the real issue is not where countries already have been in space, but where they are going.  Although no Soviet has ever been to the moon, the Soviets are kings of the hill in terms of man-hours in space. Even though their hardware is a generation behind that of the U.S., it still does the job, getting cosmonauts into orbit and keeping them there for long periods. More telling is the fact that the Soviets think space is important. Brezhnev, for instance, was fond of saying that \"the Soviet Union is on the seacoast of the Universe.\"  Since the Challenger explosion a year ago, the U.S. space program has been like an elderly turtle on its back: It twitches feebly every now and then, but gets nowhere. The problem is that the U.S. space program has no grand strategy. Because of this, many Americans (in and out of government) see the space program as either a gigantic public-relations stunt or else a strictly military enterprise. NASA administrator James Fletcher\\'s announcement in January that the civilian-in-space program for the shuttle was kaput for \"the next 20 flights, maybe forever\" didn\\'t help erase this perception.  The Japanese, on the other hand, see space activity as the logical extension of what they are doing on Earth. As Donald E. Fink, editor in chief of Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, writes: \"Space science {in Japan} is considered a key technical discipline that must be mastered to ensure future economic viability.\"  The Japanese are pursuing a slow, steady, purposeful expansion into space. Last August, they launched an H-I rocket (capable of putting 1,200 pounds of payload in orbit). The H-I was 100% made-in-Japan -- a first for them. After eight scheduled flights, the H-I will be succeeded in 1992 by the H-II, which will be almost 50 yards long and will be able to put 4,400 pounds in orbit.  According to a series in Aviation Week last summer, the Japanese plan to have their own unmanned space station, new launch vehicles and space shuttle around the turn of the century. Originally, Japan was to have put up 10% of the cost of the U.S. space station; it also was to have supplied an astronaut for the shuttle in 1988. But the shuttle has been postponed and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced last month that new cost estimates could delay the space station until 1995-96.  A huge advantage the Japanese have over the U.S. is continuity of funding. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, has urged the scrapping of both the space station and the Challenger replacement orbiter to help ease the federal deficit. Its reasoning on the space station -- \"a lack of compelling arguments to undertake the project\" -- shows more clearly than anything else the walking-through-mine-fields status of the American space program. The Japanese can make long-term plans, confident that funding and facilities will still be there when today\\'s eggs hatch.  Unlike the Americans and Soviets, who are fond of comparing space development to the opening of frontiers, the Japanese are characteristically restrained in talking publicly about longer-term strategic goals. This may not just be good manners. By keeping a low profile, they might not only avoid any potential foreign backlash, but also keep their space programs going smoothly at home. As Aviation Week says, \"At home, downplaying the scope of the space program reduces oversight by the Japanese Diet, which to date has focused little attention on . . . relatively small bites out of the national budget.\"  When they do talk about space, Japanese officials put heavy stress on international aspects. Hiroyuki Osawa, president of the National Space Development Agency of Japan, says: \"When the H-II becomes operational, we shall be about to participate in all aspects of world space activities.\"  Shigebumi Saito, acting chairman of the Space Activities Commission of Japan, is even more emphatic. \"The scope of space development is so large, international cooperation will become more and more important,\" he says.  However, as the U.S. government becomes more of an iffy partner, the Japanese will probably reassess how international they want to be. Their international space efforts may well come through multinational corporations operating in Japan.  Finally, if anyone were taking bets on which society would be most adaptable to living and working in space, the odds-on favorite would have to be the Japanese. The Japanese culture, with its strong emphasis on politeness, cooperation and getting along in cramped quarters, is custom-tailored to space stations and permanent space habitats. In addition, resource-poor, energy-poor Japan certainly cannot be blind to the possibilities of utilizing extra-terrestrial resources, such as asteroid mining and solar-power satellites.  The American novelist Robert A. Heinlein once characterized the enormous potentials of space by writing: \"It\\'s raining soup. Grab a bucket!\" The Japanese are slowly forming bucket brigades while the U.S. is trading in its buckets for sieves.  --- Mr. Kirwan is assistant editor of the Energy Journal, published by the International Association of Energy Economists.

       " 'WSJ870319-0109': 'Antitrust Measures Against 3 Airlines</HL> AIRLINES (AIR) </IN> The European Community Commission said it will take antitrust actions against three carriers -- but not for three weeks.  The three airlines -- Lufthansa AG of West Germany, Italy\\'s Alitalia and Olympic Airways of Greece -- are being granted the three weeks as \"a last opportunity\" to show their willingness to amend practices the commission deems anticompetitive, a commission spokesman said.  The grace period also will give the commission a chance to see how much progress the 12 Common Market transportation ministers make when they meet here next week to discuss EC airline deregulation. The commission is understood to be reluctant to discipline any airlines without first giving the ministers another opportunity to approve a deregulation plan.  Last summer, 10 large European airlines were told the commission intended to start antitrust proceedings against them. Seven of the carriers then pledged to modify their methods of fixing tariffs, pooling revenue and dividing routes with other European airlines.  But Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic didn\\'t \"indicate their readiness to modify those agreements or practices which restrict competition,\" the commission said. Now, if the airlines don\\'t do that within three weeks, the commission will ask their governments to intervene to make their operations conform to EC law. If that fails, the commission would bring the governments before the European Court of Justice.

       " 'WSJ870319-0108': 'Dams\\' Safety Worries Officials Who Believe Repairs Are Lagging --- Earthquakes and Other Risks Give Nightmares to Some Despite a Recent Respite --- Stitching Up a TVA Crack --- By Bruce Ingersoll Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> The 1983 dam scare here is remembered as \"the peril at Pinopolis.\"  On a languid summer morning, the West Pinopolis Dam suddenly sprang an enormous leak, setting off alarms in the powerhouse. While the police rapped on doors to evacuate downstream residents, emergency workers struggled to keep the huge dam from collapsing. They tried plugging the leak with weighted bales of hay. They tried steel plates. Increasingly desperate, they bought a furniture store\\'s entire stock of mattresses, only to find them too buoyant. Finally, they slapped together a makeshift dam with pile-driven utility poles.  A disaster was averted -- for the time being. But federal dam regulators worry that West Pinopolis is one of many dams around the country that would collapse if a severe earthquake hit. Hundreds of dams couldn\\'t withstand a major flood. Thousands more have fallen into disrepair, some leaking or slumping so badly that they are in danger of collapse.  \"One of these times, Mother Luck isn\\'t going to hold,\" warns William Bivins, the dam safety coordinator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \"One of these high-hazard dams is going to pop at night when everybody is asleep in bed. It will wipe out hundreds of people.\"  But to some top officials, warnings about dam disasters are overblown, and in most states public interest in dam safety is low. In the 1970s, nearly 500 people died in six major U.S. dam breaks, but in the 1980s the fatalities have been few in this country, though a 1985 dam break in Italy killed more than 220 people.  Meanwhile, dam-safety initiatives have been slowed by tight budgets, bureaucratic inertia and the lack of a political constituency. \"All of our constituents are dead people,\" says safety advocate Bruce Tschantz, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Tennessee.  Of the 80,000 or so dams in the U.S., about 8,000 are owned or regulated by federal agencies. The rest are owned by farmers, ranchers, developers, utilities or states and municipalities. Most major dams are owned and maintained by big agencies such as the Pentagon\\'s Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department\\'s Bureau of Reclamation.  The bureau is still haunted by the 1976 collapse of the Teton Dam in Idaho as it was being filled for the first time, killing 11 people. One-fifth of the bureau\\'s 300 dams, all in the West, are classified as unsafe. Critics say the bureau doesn\\'t treat dam safety as a priority. Bureau officials disagree, but since 1980 the agency has spent only 11% of $750 million authorized by Congress for safety \"modifications.\"  Internal documents obtained from the Corps of Engineers, meanwhile, show that a superflood would overwhelm at least 20 of that agency\\'s 600 dams, engulfing such communities as Houston and Valley City, N.D. The corps is also studying how well several structures, including two dikes on the Clemson University campus in South Carolina, would hold up in a major earthquake. If the dikes failed, the football stadium, dubbed \"Death Valley\" by Clemson\\'s foes, would be swamped. Overall, \"We are concerned about 36 dams,\" says Lloyd Duscha, the corps\\' deputy director of engineering and construction.  Remedial efforts have been limited, however. Some cost-conscious Reagan administration appointees haven\\'t shared agency engineers\\' sense of urgency. \"Bureaucratic engineers always try to figure out a way to perpetuate themselves and build up their budgets,\" asserts William Gianelli, who in recent years oversaw the corps as assistant Army secretary for civil works.  On the state level, the number of unsafe dams has been reduced to 1,948 from about 2,900 in 1981, according to a survey for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Many dam owners simply dismantled their aging structures rather than make repairs. But the survey says that only 21 states have adequate regulatory programs and that the rest are underfunded and undermanned.  For Joseph Ellam, Pennsylvania\\'s director of dam safety, the situation is unsettling. \"Catastrophic failures have occurred before, and they will occur again,\" he warns. \"With the exception of nuclear power plants, no man-made structure has a greater potential for killing a large number of people than a dam.\"  The West Pinopolis Dam, 30 miles from Charleston, S.C., is one such dam.  Although the dam now is in good repair, earthquake experts believe it would fail in the event of an earthquake as powerful as the devastating Charleston earthquake of 1886, which killed 86 persons and caused panic as far away as Cleveland.  If the dam failed, some 2,000 residents along the Cooper River \"wouldn\\'t have any time to run for their lives,\" says Ronald Corso, the director of hydropower licensing for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The flood would engulf the Charleston Naval Yard and the Atlantic Fleet\\'s nuclear-weapons arsenal as well as a major industrial corridor, causing $1 billion in damage. It would also clog Charleston\\'s harbor with silt, closing a key port for the Navy.  The dam is vulnerable to an extraordinary phenomenon known as \"liquefaction,\" Mr. Corso says. Seismic shock waves could \"liquefy\" the sand in the dam\\'s foundation, turning it into quicksand or \"mush.\" The shuddering dam would quickly slump, spilling the waters of Lake Moultrie in a thunderous rush.  The dam\\'s owner, South Carolina Public Service Authority, also known as Santee Cooper, calls the chance of such a disaster remote, but the state-owned utility, under federal pressure, has agreed to strengthen the dam. \"We don\\'t care where they get the money so long as they fix it,\" Mr. Corso says.  The energy regulatory commission has worries about more than 100 of the 2,000 dams it regulates and has ordered several utilities to make repairs. Montana Power Co., for one, is rehabilitating an ice-battered dam near Missoula to protect the Clark Fork River. It holds back tons of toxic smelting waste in the bottom silt, Mr. Corso says. \"If you dump that waste down the river, it will be the biggest mess known to mankind.\"  The Tennessee Valley Authority has pared its list of unsafe dams to 14 from 21. Fixing Fontana Dam in western North Carolina is a high priority. At 480 feet, Fontana is the tallest dam east of the Rocky Mountains. The upper part of the dam needs reinforcing against a major earthquake. And an alarming 100-foot-long crack in the concrete has reopened and requires restitching with cables.  In Wyoming, Reclamation Bureau officials are keeping close watch on the badly leaking Fontenelle Dam on the Green River. The same sort of seepage that caused a near-failure in 1965 is underminining the dam. The officials are keeping the reservoir level as low as possible, rather than risk deluging Green River, Wyo., (population: 13,000), but they admit to being at \"Mother Nature\\'s mercy.\"  Last summer, so much melted snow came down from the mountains that officials couldn\\'t discharge water fast enough to keep the reservoir from refilling. \"We baby-sat that dam night and day,\" says one Reclamation Bureau official. \"We had two bulldozer operators there 24 hours a day.\"  For years, federal officials in the field have been warning their superiors about Fontanelle and other deteriorating dams. But cumbersome cost-sharing arrangements and resistance from the White House budget office have limited the Reclamation Bureau\\'s efforts to a few projects. While the agency has begun budgeting more money for dam safety, many other projects will have to wait.  \"It takes a long time to get momentum building behind a program, especially when it doesn\\'t have high administration support,\" says Neil Parrett, the bureau\\'s chief of dam design. \"We all could do better. But I celebrate the progress we\\'ve made to reduce the threat out there.\"  The Reclamation Bureau, like most of its regulatory brethren, has been slow to bring its substandard dams into compliance with the latest safety guidelines, as ordered by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Federal dams should be stable enough to withstand the \"maximum credible earthquake,\" usually defined as the quake from a known source like California\\'s San Andreas Fault that could cause the most severe \"vibratory ground motion\" at a dam site.  Under the guidelines, federal dams should also have enough spillway capacity to discharge the \"probable maximum flood.\" Hydrologists calculate such a flood on the basis of the worst combination of meteorological and hydrological events likely to occur in watershed. In the Rockies, for example, it could be heavy rains mixed with a record snowmelt.  Several Reclamation Bureau dams, including four on the Salt River and two on the Verde River in Arizona, are vulnerable to \"overtopping\" by a superflood. The crucial dam is a national historic monument, Theodore Roosevelt Dam. If it were overtopped by the probable maximum flood on the Salt, the top of the dam would crumble, triggering a \"domino effect,\" says the bureau\\'s Mr. Parrett.  The flood would heavily damage two downriver dams, knock out a third and surge on toward Phoenix. \"Phoenix gets drowned,\" Mr. Parrett says. An estimated 250,000 people would be flooded; property damages would hit $9.5 billion.  The Corps of Engineers has made even less headway than the Reclamation Bureau, largely because of budget ceilings and high-level skepticism at the Pentagon about probable maximum floods. The corps under Mr. Gianelli undertook only two dam modifications between 1981 and 1984. In contrast, the much smaller TVA started five. Mr. Gianelli, now a engineering consultant in California, says that the corps could never explain to his satisfaction how it calculated the probable maximum flood.  Prado Dam, perched in a canyon above suburban Los Angeles, is one project that Mr. Gianelli held up. If the dam failed, the probable maximum flood on the Santa Ana River would inundate 1.3 million residents in Anaheim and other suburbs and cause as much as $40 billion in damages, mostly in Orange County, according to the corps\\'s risk assessment.  Mr. Gianelli, who served as California\\'s water resources director under Gov. Ronald Reagan, remains unpersuaded. \"That dam has been there 50 years,\" he says. \"It has never filled to the point where the spillway is even used. You fix a dam if it\\'s leaking.\"  In the private sector, meanwhile, dam safety continues to lag. Some farmers scoff at warnings that the dams they built with the Soil Conservation Service\\'s assistance are about to flood out their neighbors. And many corporate dam owners put off costly repairs.  \"It\\'s the last place anybody wants to spend money,\" says Gerald W. Farquhar, a Washington attorney. \"Everybody says it\\'ll be the other fellow\\'s dam that goes.\"  Among state governments, money for regulating dams remains tight. While California leads the nation with a $3.8 million budget and a 60-person staff, most states make do with much less -- on average, $265,000 a year. Some states, including Delaware, Alabama and Hawaii, don\\'t yet have a semblance of a dam-safety program.  Pennsylvania, however, has accomplished more than most federal agencies, whittling its backlog of 208 unsafe dams to 72 in five years. More than $50 million, including low-interest state loans, has gone into dam repairs, usually under consent agreements with the state. The Pennsylvania Gas &amp; Water Co. has agreed to fix 16 water-supply dams, while the Greater Johnstown Water Authority has promised to fix or dismantle the Salt Lick Dam near the site of a famous dam-break nearly a century ago.  \"If Salt Lick were to fail,\" says the state\\'s Mr. Ellam, \"it would be as bad as the great Johnstown Flood of 1889, the greatest catastrophe in U.S. history,\" that swept 2,200 persons to their deaths.

We hope the rest of the world hears him.  Dr. Koryagin, a Soviet psychiatrist, had dissented from the longstanding Soviet practice of putting outspoken critics of the system in psychiatric hospitals. For this, the Soviets put Dr. Koryagin in prisons and labor camps for six years. He got out last month. Glasnost.  Dr. Koryagin asked Sunday that a commission be set up to start processing political inmates out of the Soviet Union\\'s psychiatric hospitals. We have a better suggestion for Mr. Gorbachev: Blow up the \"hospitals.\"  The Soviet Union\\'s well-documented use of psychiatry as punishment is one of the base phenomena of the 20th century. Medical science, in a forward leap of knowledge, has enhanced lives; the Soviet Union, deciding to play Mr. Hyde in a world of Dr. Jekylls, perverted psychiatric pharmacology to destroy lives.  Vladimir Tsurikov, for example, was committed in 1980 for \"emigrational delusions.\" He was repeatedly injected with sulfazin, a preparation of purified sulfur with no therapeutic effect. He said: \"The sulfazin made my temperature rise. My tongue hung out. . . . This nightmare lasted a week, until I was invited to chat with some medical students. I couldn\\'t walk, so I was carried. In the auditorium it turned out I couldn\\'t move my tongue.\" Prisoners are overdosed with tranquilizers, given contraindicated drugs, beaten, tied to beds.  Amnesty International knows of some 50 such prisoners. Probably there are more. Freed from prison, Dr. Koryagin wishes to leave the country. The system \"will remain a dictatorship,\" he says, \"until there is some sort of counterbalance to the Communist Party, some political alternative.\"  He is right. Glasnost -- \"openness\" -- will be a warped word so long as the Soviet Communist Party holds men and women to be insane for opposing communism. Glasnost may begin to carry meaning when the psychiatric prisons are opened to international inspection teams, emptied and shut down. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0105': '--- By S. Enders Wimbush</HL> The recent nationalist riots by Kazakhs in the Soviet city of Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, are a serious portent for Soviet planners who envisage unimpeded Russian rule in the Soviet empire into the indefinite future. And they are an important reminder to outside analysts who have failed to recognize that minority nationalism remains a prominent threat to the empire\\'s long-term survival and short-term stability.  We seldom receive direct evidence of nationalist unrest inside the U.S.S.R. The Russians have succeeded in controlling nationalist feelings and resentment in many parts of the Soviet state through the use of elaborate police, military and intelligence apparatuses. Also, the movement of information from the empire\\'s non-Russian periphery often faces the added disadvantage of language barriers, distance and the lack of interest on the part of both the Moscow intelligentsia, who are the usual channel for other kinds of dissidence, and public opinion beyond Soviet borders.  With regard to Alma-Ata, it is tempting to conclude that the Soviet regime\\'s own apparent candor on the matter is further evidence of Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s vaunted glasnost campaign. But the Soviet reporting was an effort to structure unstoppable news to the Soviets\\' best advantage. The hundreds of foreigners in Alma-Ata would have rapidly exported the story in any case, putting their own interpretations on the tumultuous events.  December\\'s riots in Alma-Ata were not the first. In 1980, Kazakhs rioted when Soviet officials attempted quietly to bury Kazakh soldiers who had been killed in Afghanistan in Soviet military, rather than Moslem, cemeteries. The war in Afghanistan, in fact, has prompted a number of minority protests -- from the Baltic states and Transcaucasia to Central Asia. There were several mutinies by Soviet Moslem soldiers inside Afghanistan in 1981 and 1985 and at least one protest in the U.S.S.R. by Moslems in Astrakhan in 1985.  The recent Alma-Ata riots demand our close attention. First, while estimates of the number of rioters vary greatly, from 10,000 to several hundred thousand, they are significant by any standard, and in the Soviet context they are truly extraordinary. So are the number of casualties -- as many as 40 killed, according to unofficial sources -- including policemen, militia and Communist Party officials. (Soviet officials admit to only two deaths.)  And while early reports from Soviet sources insisted that the rioters were mostly young people and other impressionable elements, reports from eyewitnesses now indicate that practically every stratum of Kazakh society was represented. Soviet officials have passed severe sentences on a number of young university faculty members, including women, and embarked on pre-emptive purges of social-science faculties in nearby republics. Thus they have admitted that the rioters were not simply, or even primarily, thugs or \"parasites\" and that the movement could spread.  Second, the apparent cause of the riots -- the dismissal of Kazakhstan Communist Party First Secretary Dinmukhamed Kunaev, himself a Kazakh, and his replacement by Gennadi Kolbin, a Russian crony of Mr. Gorbachev -- is both revealing and suggestive. At base it shows the substantial groundswell of anti-Russian feeling that lies just below the surface among the non-Russian natives.  The conduct of the riots suggests planning and coordination. Mr. Kunaev\\'s dismissal had been rumored for weeks; when it was announced, the streets suddenly came alive. The Soviets\\' own reporting claims that the riots were \"not spontaneous\" and that the leadership of the riots was well organized.  Only the most naive optimist will conclude that Mr. Kunaev\\'s replacement by a Russian is the sole cause of the disturbances. They clearly result from much deeper and longstanding hostility. Its roots can be traced to the Russians\\' massacre of Kazakhs in 1916, when Central Asian Moslems rioted after being ordered to report for conscription to the czar\\'s imperial service; to the forced settlement of the nomadic Kazakhs on Stalin\\'s orders in the 1930s, which cost the Kazakhs one-third of their total population, or one million lives; to Moscow\\'s steady inundation of Kazakhstan with Russians, until the local Kazakhs now form a minority within their own region; and to the recent heavy attacks in the republic against Islam, to which most Kazakhs adhere.  One need not have the ability to predict events like the Alma-Ata riots to appreciate the political sensitivity of replacing the Kazakh Kunaev with Kolbin the Russian. Unless we conclude that Mr. Gorbachev intended gratuitous offense to the Kazakh people by breaking one of the seldom-violated principles of cadre appointments -- i.e., a member of the nominal nationality of a republic becomes first secretary -- then we must conclude that he blundered.  Will more glasnost help Mr. Gorbachev remedy his problems in Central Asia, as several commentators have suggested? Glasnost is an unlikely palliative for the grievances of the U.S.S.R.\\'s many national minorities. Given a fair chance, many would be certain to describe Russian-minority relations openly in terms that the Kremlin cannot tolerate, such as \"colonialism,\" \"Russian chauvinism,\" or racism, which is precisely why glasnost is unlikely to be extended in any significant way to the non-Russian borderlands.  Alma-Ata should sound the final death knell in the U.S.S.R. and abroad for the New Soviet Man fantasy of the official Soviet liturgy. In the face of massive Soviet efforts over many decades to convince the rioters\\' grandparents and parents of the wisdom of sublimating their national feelings to an overarching \"Soviet patriotism,\" their children today by choice remain more Kazakh than \"Soviet.\"  This fact should caution against accepting uncritically the version of Soviet reality of many Western political scientists and economists, who insist that Soviet political and economic progress has given birth to a new generation of upwardly mobile non-Russians who have an inviolable stake in the system, and who can therefore be counted on to defend it. What we now know beyond doubt is that a large number of Kazakh young people and professionals with good prospects and positions were prepared to sacrifice them to remain Kazakh above all else. At some point the magnetic attraction of economic betterment becomes meaningless.  This isn\\'t so for a far more ominous attraction, however. Several Western accounts of the Alma-Ata riots noted that some demonstrators were carrying signs that read \"We want to join China,\" or words to that effect. Post-riot Soviet reports referred to some of the rioters\\' \"obnoxious banners.\" Assuming that these banners reflect the political feelings of some, if not many, Kazakhs, they represent an important reversal of a crucial regional reality. China has a large Kazakh population of its own, which it has historically oppressed. Over the past 50 years, there have been many Kazakh migrations from China to the Soviet empire. However, in the early 1980s China undertook important and far-reaching changes with a view toward stabilizing a nagging borderland vulnerability that the Soviets have conscientiously exploited for decades.  China still has some distance to go before its Kazakhs will be fully content. But if the banners are representative, China has already moved far enough to reverse the poles of attraction.  The Alma-Ata riots will be seen throughout the Soviet Union as \"Moslem riots,\" even though Kazakh nationalism is in many ways different from nationalism among other Soviet Moslems in that it has always been strongly secular in character. We simply cannot know at this stage if the common bond of Islam among the Kazakhs or the Islamic stimuli from Iran and Afghanistan played an important role in the direction or severity of the riots.  We do know that Soviet leaders have recently expressed considerable apprehension about the politicization of Islam in Central Asia. They are undoubtedly concerned that the Kazakhs\\' example will spread to other parts of Central Asia and that it will acquire in transit a more pronounced Islamic coloring. The distance between Kazakh nationalism and \"Moslem nationalism\" is indeed short and could be easily bridged.  Mr. Gorbachev has already signaled that he is aware of this possibility. For example, his cadre is responsible for orchestrating the current vehement anti-Islamic campaign in the borderlands, the most strident campaign of its kind since the Khrushchev days. Mr. Gorbachev himself, as recently as November, complained in Tashkent about the rising specter of unchecked religious adherence, even among the party faithful, and demanded tough measures to deal with it. On the subjects of national feeling and religion, he has provided no evidence to support his image in the West as a liberal pragmatist.  A sizable cross-section of Kazakhs have already spoken, glasnost or no glasnost. Even if Mr. Gorbachev cracks down hard and ruthlessly on the perpetrators of the Kazakh riots, as he has already begun to do, there is every likelihood that other Soviet minorities, non-Moslems as well as Moslems, will raise their own demands in their own ways and in their own time.  American strategist Albert Wohlstetter certainly comes close to the mark when he describes the U.S.S.R. and its satellites as having \"the brittle stability of an explosive mixture in a strong container capped under high pressure.\"  --- Mr. Wimbush is director of the Society for Central Asian Studies in Oxford, England.

       " 'WSJ870319-0104': 'On Film: The Plastic Fantastic Production Budget --- By Julie Salamon</HL> During production of \"Hollywood Shuffle,\" his first movie, producer-writer-director Robert Townsend nearly lost hope. Having sunk his $60,000 bankroll into the project, he was flat broke and only half finished. At that bleak moment he looked for inspiration and found it -- in his junk mail.  Retrieving the unsolicited application for a preferred Visa card with a pre-approved $7,000 credit line from the trash, Mr. Townsend saw how he could complete his film. \"I called Citibank in New York, the Bank of Boston, Great American Bank and others until I wound up with a $40,000 credit line.\"  Then he went on a shopping spree. He put the film\\'s wardrobe on his Saks Fifth Avenue card, and catering on Montgomery Ward. He paid for his celluloid stock with his Visa card. When he found out the film store gave a discount to students, Mr. Townsend -- who wasn\\'t one -- got his 10% off after he and his crew donned UCLA T-shirts.  Mr. Townsend is nothing if not quick on his feet. He shot his film in 14 days (\"We couldn\\'t be on bleepers and bloopers,\" he laughs. \"There weren\\'t any outtakes.\"). And he sold it almost as fast. Distributor Samuel Goldwyn Co. bought the picture almost as soon as it was completed -- and paid off Mr. Townsend\\'s outstanding credit lines \"immediately.\"  At 30 years old, Mr. Townsend approaches life with a nice mixture of breezy charm and earnest idealism. Until now he\\'s been an actor and a stand-up comic, who\\'s also very funny when he\\'s sitting down doing impersonations over breakfast. After doing commercials for Pepsi and IBM and improvisational theater with the Second City troupe in Chicago and Off Broadway in New York, he went to Hollywood. He\\'s been featured in movies, including \"A Soldier\\'s Story\" and \"Streets of Fire.\"  But as \"Hollywood Shuffle\" opens tomorrow in New York and Washington, then in cities around the country, he makes his debut as an all-around talent. In addition to being the star, director and producer, Mr. Townsend was the special-effects man (he spritzed his actors in the face with a seltzer bottle to affect sweat) and the janitor. Since he couldn\\'t afford permits for filming on the street, the movie was literally shot on the run, as actors jumped in and out of vans between takes to avoid getting ticketed.  \"We wrote it as we went along,\" said Mr. Townsend, who wore a T-shirt over a thrift-shop college sweater to an interview. He explained that the picture began as a series of vignettes that he\\'d intended to use as a visual resume to convince studios he could direct. \"First it was a short, then another short. Then we decided to add a story. \\'A mother! You need a mother!\\' someone would say. Then it would be, \\'A girlfriend! You need a girlfriend!\\'\"  What emerged from this creative frenzy is Mr. Townsend\\'s funny and imaginative -- and loosely autobiographical -- study of the plight of black actors in Hollywood. Though the makeshift story line sometimes proceeds a little clumsily, \"Hollywood Shuffle\" crackles with high spirits.  In one bit, Mr. Townsend introduces us to \"Black Acting School,\" where white professors prepare Oxford-educated black actors for the roles Hollywood has to offer: contemporary (pimps) or classic (slaves). He\\'s staged this sequence like the commercials that interrupt the late show \"You, too, can be a computer programmer!\"  He\\'s also created his own version of TV movie critics -- two street kids with their own amusing rating system. \"First of all, I can\\'t stand movies with titles I can\\'t pronounce,\" says one. He shows us actors trained in Shakespeare stumbling over such tryout lines as: \"I ain\\'t be got no weapon.\" And he invents a new superhero: \"Ram-bro.\"  The picture bounces along with Mr. Townsend\\'s merry sense of satire, but it also has a point, which he elaborated on in an interview. Affecting the overbred tone of a public-radio announcer, he said: \"I\\'m tired of saying \\'ain\\'t.\\' I simply can\\'t say \\'ain\\'t\\' anymore.\"  Mr. Townsend says he refuses to take parts that he feels are demeaning to blacks. \"People aren\\'t going to remember you that way. They won\\'t say, \\'Oh, you were the rapist on \\'Hill Street Blues.\\' Or, \\'Hey, caught you stealing that TV set on \\'Cagney and Lacey,\\'\" he said. \"I\\'d rather do something else. If you whore yourself around, people will say you are a whore. I don\\'t know where Eddie {Murphy} is. Or Richard {Pryor}. I look at \\'Critical Condition\\' and think: What is that?\"  Mr. Townsend grew up in Chicago and lived briefly on welfare after his parents split up when he was a small boy. His mother then got a job with the post office, where she still works. Mr. Townsend wanted to be a basketball player, but was diverted into theater by his coach, who preferred Mr. Townsend\\'s Walter Brennan imitations to his dunk shot.  He began acting in a community theater while he was still in high school. Later, he dropped out of college to do improvisational theater. Then, after a few years in New York, he moved to Los Angeles to do improv, and he was cast in \"Streets of Fire.\"  With the money he saved from that picture and \"Soldier\\'s Story,\" he decided to try his hand at directing. He financed himself, because nobody else would. When he ran out of money the first time, he went back to work. The money from \"American Flyers\" -- then two other films -- carried him to the point where he had no more money and no more jobs. That\\'s when the Visa application arrived.  Since then, Mr. Townsend has directed Eddie Murphy\\'s concert film, which will be released later this year. (The editing, he says, involved \"getting around profanity and lawsuits and down to an \\'R\\' rating.\") He\\'s starred in an \"Amazing Stories\" episode, and he\\'s making plans for his next feature film. He wants to do it all -- and why not? The man carries plastic and he can improvise. ',\n",

The three were among several individuals and the brokerage firm who in January settled related civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting wrongdoing. The SEC had charged Brooks Weinger and the former executives with securities fraud in the 1983 underwriting of three new issues by what the SEC said was a predecessor firm.  Named in the new criminal-contempt charges were: Marvin Hamburger and William P. Satnick, former vice presidents of the purported predecessor firm, Brooks, Hamburger, Satnick Inc., and Jan E. Brooks, former president of both Brooks Weinger and Brooks Hamburger. They were charged with violating a 1981 injunction against future SEC violations by making allegedly fraudulent statements regarding one of the three new issues in 1983, American Technology Management Corp.  Individuals accused by the SEC commonly settle the charges by agreeing to an injunction against future violations. Future violations are then punishable by contempt proceedings. Kathleen A. Warwick, head of the SEC\\'s New York regional office, said this criminal-contempt action -- the third filed by the New York office over the last year -- indicates the \"seriousness with which the commission views disobedience of injunctive orders.\"  Among other things, the SEC charged, the three men violated securities law by telling various \"penny stock\" publications -- including Penny Stock Preview, and Cheap Investor -- that American Technology was entering the field of treatment of sexually transmitted diseases of the immune system. The SEC said the company\\'s prospectus noted, instead, that it was engaged primarily in financial consulting services.  According to Miss Warwick, each of the men agreed when they settled the civil charges in January that they would later plead guilty to one count of criminal contempt. Maximum sentence on such charges without a jury trial is six months imprisonment or a $5,000 fine.  Ira W. Berman, an attorney for the three men, said the SEC charges were \"not worth defending,\" so his clients agreed to settle them. The three must enter their pleas next Tuesday, before federal Judge Charles L. Brieant.  The SEC described American Technology as a dormant company with no operations or assets; the initial offering in 1983 was rescinded by the agency.  In settling the civil charges, Messrs. Hamburger, Brooks and Satnick were barred from the U.S. securities industry for five years, five years and four years respectively, the SEC said. ',\n",

London-based Dixons, an electrical appliance retailer, said Cyclops holders tendered 2.3 million shares, or 54% of the 4.3 million shares outstanding, under a previously reported offer to buy all shares for $90.25 each, or $384 million. The offer expired at 12:01 a.m EST yesterday.  Coupled with Dixons\\'s existing stake, the tender boosted the company\\'s holding in Cyclops to 56%.  In spite of the successful tender offer, a rival group of bidders led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc. said it will press ahead with efforts to acquire Cyclops. \"We have not quit yet,\" said Stuart Rose, Audio/Video\\'s chairman and chief executive officer.  The Audio/Video group launched a surprise $80-a-share offer for Cyclops last month-two weeks before Cyclops agreed to be acquired by Dixons. Last week, the group offered to sweeten its offer to $92.50 a share under certain conditions, including a stipulation that Cyclops provide it with the same confidential financial data given to Dixons. Cyclops said it didn\\'t consider the proposal an offer.  Mr. Rose, whose group includes Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd., a Citicorp unit, said he expects to make an announcement within a day or two regarding future action.  \"To get beaten in a bidding war is one thing,\" Mr. Rose said. \"But to lose because the company wouldn\\'t open its books and put all bidders on the same level playing field means shareholders are not getting what they deserve for their stock.\"  Dixons, in light of the modest margin of victory, waived an earlier condition of its offer that 80% of shares outstanding be tendered. With a majority stake, the British company said it is entitled to designate a majority of Cyclops directors and to subscribe to an additional 5.4 million shares that have been authorized but not issued.  The focus of both suitors is Cyclops\\'s Silo Inc. retailing division, which operates a nationwide chain of 100 appliance and consumer electronics stores. Audio/Video is a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer.  As part of Dixons\\'s agreement, the British company plans to retain Silo and sell Cyclops\\'s specialty steel and nonresidential construction assets to a unit of Alleghany Corp., a New York-based insurance and steel concern, for about $111.6 million and the assumption of certain Cyclops under-funded pension plans.  Alleghany intends to spin off the unit, MSL Industries Inc., to holders before MSL acquires the steel and construction assets from Dixons. MSL would assume the name Cyclops and retain Pittsburgh as its corporate headquarters. The Alleghany transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory clearance.  John Gilbertson of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which advised Dixons in the transaction, said the Cyclops shares that weren\\'t tendered will be converted into the right to receive $90.25 a share upon completion of the merger. He said Morgan Stanley expects completion of the merger in two to three months.  If the Audio/Video group is unsuccessful in halting the merger, Cyclops\\'s long search for a buyer will end. Shareholders rejected a leveraged buyout proposal by senior management last year, and proposals to buy the company\\'s steel and construction businesses have also failed.

       " 'WSJ870319-0089': 'Big Ideas on Where To Sell His Books --- Chain Stores Aren\\'t the Place For Nick Lyons\\'s Wares; Try the Auto-Parts Store --- By Sanford L. Jacobs Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal</HL> For Verlyn Klinkenborg it was a dream come true. The New York Times raved about his first book, \"Making Hay,\" a 160-page paean to family farming in the American heartland. It was the kind of review that sends people flocking to bookstores. But in this case, few would-be readers could find it.  \"Making Hay\" was published by Nick Lyons Books in New York, the type of small specialty publishing house that is all but ignored by the nation\\'s big retail book chains. But Nick Lyons, the company\\'s founder and president, has a knack for finding other outlets for his books.  Take the NAPA Auto Store in Rock Rapids, Iowa. Why an auto-parts store stocks a stack of books on hay farming is easily explained. \"Verlyn is a nephew of mine, of course,\" says the store\\'s owner, Kenneth K. Klinkenborg. To give folks in Rock Rapids an opportunity to buy the book, Mr. Klinkenborg used to drive 32 miles to Sioux Falls in his pickup truck to buy copies, paying the full $14.95 retail price. It didn\\'t bother him that he didn\\'t make a cent reselling them to his customers. \"I\\'m just trying to get as many books sold as I can,\" he explains.  When Mr. Lyons got wind of this, he offered to sell Mr. Klinkenborg copies at 40% off the cover price, even if he ordered only six books. The arrangement pleases the author\\'s uncle, who says, \"We sold about 10 or 15 already, and they let me make a little money, too.\"  So it goes in the backwaters of book publishing, where 15,000 small publishers stay afloat, or even turn a comfortable profit, by catering to quirky or limited interests and doggedly pursuing every last sale. They operate with a gritty resourcefulness unheard of -- and unnecessary -- at the 300 or so big trade-book publishing houses that produce roughly 60% of the 50,000 new titles appearing each year.  \"The most serious problem for a small publisher is persuading the chains to open an account,\" Mr. Lyons says. But chain stores have little incentive to buy 50 or 100 copies of a single title from outfits such as his. John Dessauer, the director of the Center for Book Research at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, explains: \"The cost of opening an account for one title is going to be more than any profit from the book.\"  Yet small publishers provide a rich variety, printing books on odd subjects, giving unknown authors a voice and resurrecting out-of-print titles. Howell Book House Inc. of New York has been successfully publishing books about dogs for 26 years. Its mainstay is a line of 60 books, each devoted to a different breed. \"We are the Tiffany of dog publishing,\" says Sean Frawley, the president.  Occasionally, a tiny publisher hits pay dirt. Ten Speed Press in Berkeley, Calif., published \"What Color is Your Parachute?\" in 1972. The career-planning book became a runaway best seller a few years later and still sells briskly.  Nick Lyons Books hasn\\'t yet produced a blockbuster. But then, most of the roughly 20 new titles it brings out each year concern fishing or the outdoors-books that, Mr. Lyons concedes, \"few others are interested in publishing.\"  The people who publish Sidney Sheldon or Judith Krantz aren\\'t gnawing their knuckles because Mr. Lyons beat them to \"Angling Entomology: A Primer for Fly Fishermen.\" But Mr. Lyons has been successfully publishing such fare for more than 20 years, first for other publishers and, for the past four years, as head of his company. Though revenue was a meager $447,000 for the year ended last March 31 and is headed toward $800,000 in the current fiscal year, his company hasn\\'t run in the red or needed to borrow.  For Mr. Lyons fishing is more than a publishing specialty, more than a pastime he writes about gracefully in a column in Fly Fisherman magazine. When it comes to fishing, he says, \"I am a lunatic.\"  The $100,000 seed capital to start his company came from seven well-heeled fishing cronies who are minority stockholders. Mr. Lyons owns 51% of the stock; active partner Peter Burford, 31, who joined him after a stint at Crown Publishers Inc., also holds an interest.  Publishing so-called backlist books that are kept in print for years on end has some advantages over publishing best sellers. A good fishing book will never match a Jackie Collins novel in total sales. But it will outlive her racy fiction, with its fickle readers. Publishers will dump most of this year\\'s best sellers on \"remainder\" tables next year, where they may fetch as little as $1 apiece.  Nick Lyons doesn\\'t put any of his titles on the remainder heap because most just keep on selling. A number of Nick Lyons books have sales increases each year \"without any work on our part,\" he says. He adds, \"It\\'s like having an annuity, and each year\\'s new titles are added to the income stream.  Occasional clinkers do creep in. A $5.95 paperback parody of university literary reviews has sold a paltry 250 copies since 1984, leaving 3,250 unsold and about $3,500 in unrecovered costs. \"This isn\\'t the kind of mistake we could afford to make every day,\" says Mr. Burford, who is responsible for production.  Small publishers can turn a profit selling as few as 1,000 copies of a book. They operate with a frugality unknown at big publishing houses, whose annual lunch tabs could keep a small firm going for a year. The printing and promotional budget for all 16 new books in the Nick Lyons spring catalog is only $65,000. A big house spends that for one book deemed to have modest sales potential, and spends millions more for a blockbuster.  A typical author\\'s advance from Nick Lyons Books is $1,500, a sum that \"would embarrass a big house,\" Mr. Lyons says. But it means the writer is eligible for royalties that much sooner. \"Our authors earn money as their books earn money,\" he says.  Mark Sosin, the author of more than a dozen fishing books, says that although he has received heftier advances for books published by big houses, they didn\\'t sell as well as those published by Nick Lyons. \"Anybody can publish,\" Mr. Sosin says. \"Marketing is another story. Nick has come up with some unusual marketing ideas.\"  The University of Scranton\\'s Mr. Dessauer, a veteran industry observer, agrees. \"The trade-book publishers don\\'t know what to do with specialized books,\" he says. \"Often they only market to the bookstores, and if the stores don\\'t buy a book, the hell with it.\"  It is not in Nick Lyons\\'s nature to shrug off sales. Twenty years ago, while working at Crown Publishers, he realized that bookstores weren\\'t the best outlets for fishing books. As a result, 95% of the books bearing his logo (a trout leaping over the firm\\'s initials) are sold elsewhere: in fishing-tackle stores, mail-order catalogs, and, of course, that auto-parts store. The \"L.L. Bean Fly Fishing Handbook,\" which has sold some 30,000 copies and is in its 12th printing, is his best-selling title.  \"We try to use common sense,\" Mr. Lyons says. \"We ask ourselves who will be interested in these books.\" For \"Grizzly Country,\" it was readers of Bear News, a publication of the Great Bear Foundation in Missoula, Mont. The foundation used an excerpt of the book in its newsletter, which has 3,000 subscribers. Later, Mr. Lyons arranged for the foundation to buy the book at wholesale to resell to its members. Lance Olsen, the foundation\\'s president, says: \"It sells good. It\\'s a classic.\"  At times, Mr. Lyons departs from formula, as when he published actress Rita Gam\\'s memoir, \"Actress to Actress,\" last fall. The manuscript, rejected by other publishers, found its way to him at a time when he was seeking something different. \"I think you can do too many fishing books,\" he says.  Miss Gam made the rounds of the talk shows, including the \"Today Show,\" to plug the book. And it became the first Nick Lyons book to be carried by the B. Dalton chain. It has sold more than 3,000 copies, is in its second printing and has made money for both publisher and author.  Miss Gam is happy. Of Nick Lyons Books, she says: \"They did anything a larger publishing house could do for me.\" The book, she adds, led to her first movie role in years, in the upcoming thriller \"Twisted,\" starring Sally Kellerman.  But with hindsight, Mr. Lyons thinks the book was too far afield for his company. \"We don\\'t have the flash to do justice to this kind of book,\" he says. \"And we don\\'t want to have the flash.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0087': 'Disclosure Standards for Credit Cards --- By John E. Yang Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> A House Banking subcommittee approved legislation limiting credit-card interest rates and requiring uniform disclosure of card terms and conditions.  The bill, approved by voice vote, now goes to the full Banking Committee for consideration, where attempts to weaken it are likely.  The interest-rate limit was added to the legislation in an amendment sponsored by the subcommittee chairman, Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), on a 5-2 vote that followed party lines. Under the provision, credit-card interest rates couldn\\'t rise more than eight percentage points above the return on one-year Treasury bills, and the ceiling would be adjusted each quarter.  Using that formula, the current limit would be 13.8%. The average bank-card interest rate nationwide now is 17.8%, according to an industry newsletter, and 18.1%, according to Federal Reserve Board data.  Under the legislation, which is sponsored by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), all credit-card applications and solicitations would be required to contain information about the card\\'s annual percentage rate; its annual fee; the period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring any finance charge, also called a grace period; and the formula used to determine the finance charge. Cards with no interest charges, such as American Express cards, would have to disclose information about their annual fees.  Current federal law requires that a consumer receive such information only when a card is issued.  Mr. Annunzio\\'s interest-rate ceiling was defeated in the subcommittee last year, and attempts to remove the provision from the current legislation are likely when the full committee considers it.  A Fed study published earlier this year concluded that interest-rate limits would lead card issuers to raise other charges, such as annual fees, and tighten credit requirements.  Noting that virtually all other consumer interest rates except those on credit cards had dropped, Mr. Schumer argued that giving more information when a consumer applies for a card would make the marketplace work more efficiently. \"Disclosure can make the marketplace work once and for all,\" he said, \"and bring interest rates down the most desirable way -- through true and full competition.\"  Testifying for the American Bankers Association, David Hunt, executive vice president of Bank of Virginia, Richmond, Va., told the lawmakers that the requirements in Mr. Schumer\\'s bill were \"fraught with too many flaws that create confusing and complex problems for both consumers and card users.\"  The banking industry favors a measure sponsored by Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.) that would require the disclosure of a card\\'s interest rate and annual fee in direct-mail solicitations only.  Legislation containing uniform disclosure requirements similar to those in Mr. Schumer\\'s bill has been introduced in the Senate by Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on consumer affairs.

       " 'WSJ870319-0086': 'Long-Term Jobs for Welfare Recipients --- By Joe Davidson Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) CONGRESS (CNG) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously passed legislation that would give states financial bonuses if long-term welfare recipients find and keep jobs.  The committee\\'s action is a major step toward welfare overhaul, a top priority on the domestic agenda of both Congress and the administration.  The bill, introduced last month by Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), would give states an average bonus of nearly $3,700 for each former recipient who remains employed over a three-year period. The funds would come from the money saved by removing the former recipients from welfare rolls and would not be paid until the savings were realized.  Liberals and conservatives are reaching compromises over the once-disputed areas of work and welfare savings. When Sen. Kennedy introduced the bill, the conservative Heritage Foundation said the liberal senator \"is making a serious and important contribution to the debate.\" Robert Rector, a Heritage policy analyst, said \"the Kennedy proposal strikes a chord with many of the themes in Ronald Reagan\\'s new welfare reform strategy.\"  President Reagan\\'s proposal would permit greater welfare experimentation by the states. The president\\'s plan, like the Kennedy legislation and other plans being promoted, is designed to lessen dependency on welfare. Rep. Harold Ford (D., Tenn.), chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance, was scheduled to introduce legislation today that could require recipients to participate in education, training or work activities and would expand certain supportive services.  Widespread dissatisfaction with current programs and the nation\\'s budget deficit have spurred the compromises on welfare. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the labor panel, called Mr. Kennedy\\'s bill \"a new approach that would be helpful.\"  \"Without imposing new mandates or requirements on the states or the private sector, this bill creates new opportunities,\" Mr. Hatch said. \"Without spending millions in new money, this measure can help states train and place long-term welfare recipients.\"  Sen. Kennedy praised the unanimous bipartisan approval and said the bill \"creates a strong, positive incentive for states to train and employ long-term welfare dependents.\"  During the first year of employment for a former recipient, the state would receive 75% of the benefit that would have been paid to the person had he or she still received Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program. That figure drops to 50% and 25% in the second and third years. After the three years, the average bonus per recipient would be nearly $3,700.  The legislation is aimed at those who have been on dependent children or refugee assistance for two continuous years and those recipients who are under 22 years old and have not completed high school.  The committee accepted an amendment that would include in the target groups the recipients of Social Security disability payments. Under another amendment, designed to ensure federal budget neutrality, states could receive bonus payments only when their job-placement rates exceed a baseyear level. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0085': '$809 Million On Redemption --- By Janet Guyon Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) BUYBACKS, REDEMPTIONS, SWAP OFFERS (BBK) DIVIDENDS (DIV) BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it will spend $809 million to redeem all but 1.2 million of its publicly held preferred shares to cut financing costs.  The redemption of 15.5 million shares, by May 1, will cut $50 million in annual dividends, AT&amp;T said. The telecommunications concern has been reducing high-cost debt in the past year or so; yesterday\\'s announcement will bring debt and preferred stock reductions to $2.5 billion since the beginning of 1986. Last year, annual fixed charges were cut $200 million through debt and preferred stock reductions, AT&amp;T said.  Analysts saw the most recent share redemption as an effort to cut financing costs as AT&amp;T also cuts operating costs through job reductions and facility consolidations. The company has warned, however, that cuts in operating costs won\\'t boost earnings much this year.  \"If you don\\'t have the managerial clout in the short term\" to boost earnings, \"you use financial clout,\" said Robert Morris, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He noted that companies in many industries have reduced financing costs as interest rates have fallen.  S. Lawrence Prendergast, an AT&amp;T vice president and treasurer, said dividends saved through the preferred share redemption will boost AT&amp;T\\'s earnings about 2 1/2 cents a share annually, given that the company will use cash, and that its investments currently yield about 6%. Analysts estimated the effect on earnings would be about two cents a share. Last year, AT&amp;T earned $139 million, or five cents a share, after accounting for a $1.7 billion restructuring charge.  Mr. Prendergast also said he thought AT&amp;T\\'s preferred share redemption was probably the biggest of any company, noting that AT&amp;T was one of the biggest issuers of such stock in the early 1970s, when these shares were issued. He said AT&amp;T has about $1 billion of debt at interest rates between 8 3/8% and 9% that is callable at a premium, but the company doesn\\'t have any current plans to call it. The company has debt between 11% and 12 7/8% that isn\\'t callable, he said.  AT&amp;T said it will redeem 600,000 shares of its $3.64 preferred issue for $50 each, and 7.3 million shares of that issue for $52.18 a share, under terms of the issue.  AT&amp;T said it will also redeem 7.6 million of its $3.74 preferred shares for $52.35 each. The record date for determining shares to be redeemed is March 26, AT&amp;T said. After redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will remain outstanding; AT&amp;T has the right to redeem all those shares for $50 each by May 1, 1988, the company said.  AT&amp;T also declared quarterly dividends on both issues of preferred and declared a quarterly dividend of 30 cents a share on its common shares, payable May 1 to stock of record March 31.  Separately, Standard &amp; Poor\\'s Corp. affirmed its double-A rating on AT&amp;T preferred shares and debentures and its A-1plus rating on the company\\'s commercial paper. About $7 billion of long-term debt is affected, S&amp;P said. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0084': 'Lies in Way It Beat Plunging Oil Prices --- Big Belgian Firm Targeted By Country\\'s \\'Financiers\\' Is Secretive About Success --- By Mark M. Nelson Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) </IN> When Adolphe Demeure de Lespaul died unexpectedly nearly two years ago, the corporate culture he had nurtured as chairman of Petrofina S.A. quickly began to fade.  It was a culture that shunned attachments to the giant holding companies that control much of the rest of Belgium\\'s economy, a culture that put independent industrial success above all else. Asked in 1984 what he thought of joining forces with one of the holding companies, the strong-willed Mr. Demeure rolled out his most damning insult: \"We are industrialists, and they are financiers.\"  But since his death, the financiers have come close to satisfying their long-held longing for this gem of the oil industry. The two holding companies, Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A., together have become Petrofina\\'s biggest shareholders, with a stake of more than 18%, and they hold six of 18 board seats. This month, they launched an effort to boost their stake indirectly, through a tender offer for a portion of Britain\\'s Imperial Continental Gas Association, which owns 7.2% of Petrofina.  The main reason for Petrofina\\'s allure has been its performance after the plunge in oil prices that began in 1985. While much of the oil industry struggled to keep from sinking, the world\\'s No. 15 oil concern quietly continued to churn out profits like clockwork as it had for two decades. Net income increased 7.6% last year, to the current equivalent of $483 million.  Chairman Jean-Pierre Amory explains the company\\'s success in one word: flexibility. He boasts about its tiny central organization of only 400 people for a company that has 200 affiliates and 22,700 employees and sales of $17.37 billion in 1985, the latest year for which revenue figures are available.  Whether the convoluted strategy of Belgium\\'s two big holding companies will succeed isn\\'t clear. Even though they increased their stake in IC Gas to 22.2% through their offer, which closed Monday, the price of IC Gas shares has continued to rise, leading to speculation that another bidder may emerge.  But clearly the Petrofina secret has come into the open. Many observers say that is why last year Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp. of the U.S. made an unsuccessful bid for IC Gas, and why Petrofina is on plenty of wish lists.  Few have been able to penetrate Petrofina\\'s inner circle to discover just how the company does so well. Analysts say Petrofina is tight-lipped about both its successes and its failures. \"It\\'s just what its name says,\" Sue Graham, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. in London, says wryly. \"Petrofina S.A. -- \"Societe Anonyme\" -- the anonymous society.\"  Petrofina won\\'t say where it makes its profits or where it buys its oil. It won\\'t disclose how much it makes on production of crude oil and how much on refining and chemical manufacturing. Some analysts think it has a special trading department that specializes in seeking out the best deals and making fast decisions on the world\\'s crude-oil markets. Others think the company bought a huge reserve of oil when the price bottomed out and will use it only after the price rises.  \"But you won\\'t see any of that mentioned in the annual report,\" says Marc de Brouwer, an analyst at Peterbroeck van Campenhout &amp; Cie. in Brussels.  One thing is clear: Petrofina has developed a profit orientation that pervades all aspects of the company -- from its oil fields in Africa, the North Sea and North America to its 11,000 Fina service stations in 16 countries in Europe, North America and Africa. Since 1978 profits have risen an average of 15% each year.  \"As long as they do that,\" says David Johnson, an oil analyst at London merchant bank Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co., \"they don\\'t have to explain too much.\"  One of Petrofina\\'s central strategies is to have plenty of cash to handle emergencies and make quick decisions. The company \"stuffs money away like there\\'s no tomorrow,\" says Ms. Graham, the Merrill Lynch analyst.  The treasure trove certainly helped the company in December 1985 to jump on Charterhouse Petroleum PLC, the British oil company, which it acquired for $230 million. And it helped again late last year when Petrofina grabbed the oil and gas interests of Williams Cos. of the U.S. for an undisclosed price.  Mr. Amory, Petrofina\\'s chairman, says he has another $1 billion on hand for the next opportunity. \"I can write four or five checks and have my billion dollars,\" he says.  He seems to take calmly the idea of a bigger holding by GBL and Societe Generale. Asked whether he is worried about the prospect of their exercising greater control, Mr. Amory replies indirectly. \"I would be worried like hell if IC Gas were to be bought by Mr. (T. Boone) Pickens (Jr.),\" the Texas corporate raider, he says. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0083': 'Higher Pay and Booming Business --- By Patricia Bellew Gray Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Major law firms\\' billing rates are soaring, reflecting the dual impact of last spring\\'s bidding war for top law-school graduates and a boom in demand for the firms\\' services.  On Wall Street, senior partners at a number of firms this year raised their hourly rates to $350 from $300. Rates for the firms\\' less-experienced lawyers rose by an even larger percentage in many cases. Indeed, lawyers fresh out of school and now working at the big firms bill as much as $100 an hour, up about 12%.  Other large firms around the country are rushing to follow suit. Paul Hastings Janofsky &amp; Walker in Los Angeles, for instance, has increased some rates by as much as 19%. Billing rates are substantially lower outside New York, but the percentage increases in certain categories are bigger.  \"A lot of law firms are holding the lid on senior partners\\' rates, because that\\'s the number most noticed by the clients,\" says Stephen Glasser, publisher of a legal newsletter, Of Counsel. \"But the firms are pushing through much larger increases in rates for junior partners and associates, which are not so obvious.\"  Law firms say they are raising rates partly to cover the cost of vastly higher salaries and sign-up bonuses for new recruits, who now command as much as $90,000 a year to start. Because most firms adhere to a lock-step compensation system, the increase in starting salaries has forced the firms to dole out raises for hundreds of other lawyers to preserve the salary differential. Overhead has soared as a result.  Other factors are at work, too. Fearful of raids by rivals that could cripple important departments, some firms are trying to buy the loyalty of key partners with hefty bonuses. Administrative and operating costs are rising sharply, especially for necessities such as computers and malpractice insurance.  And to serve clients with far-flung interests, many firms are moving to establish international practices. Opening offices in major cities around the country and overseas requires substantial capital.  But heavy demand for top firms\\' services is also allowing fees to rise. A huge increase in litigation and the recent wave of corporate restructurings has prompted firms to complain that they can\\'t hire lawyers fast enough to keep up with the crush of work.  \"These are boom times for the legal community,\" says Ed Kaufman, a partner with Los Angeles-based Irell &amp; Manella, which posted revenue of $40 million last year, up 20% from 1985.  Mr. Kaufman notes a marked increase in demand for specialists in employment law in California, where scores of companies face wrongful-discharge lawsuits filed by former employees. Demand for the services of firms with expertise in environmental, patent and tax law is especially high, too.  Aside from grumbling, corporate clients are doing little to resist the rise in rates. Years ago, most companies established in-house legal departments to take care of routine legal matters. Nowadays, they seek outside counsel only for big lawsuits or highly specialized matters like bankruptcy law or tax law.  \"The billing rate is only half the equation,\" says Guy Zoghby, counsel for the information systems group at International Business Machines Corp. \"You have to consider the hours it takes to resolve the problem and the results you achieve. This is not a commodity we\\'re talking about, and cheaper is not necessarily better.\"  Often, Mr. Zoghby points out, a company can save money on its legal bills by hiring a specialist who can dispense with the problem in far less time -- and with better results -- than a general practitioner.  Anyway, quibbling over fees in a crisis is rare because, as law firms happily point out, desperate clients usually don\\'t study the bill. By hiring a law firm with a national reputation, \"the CEO can\\'t blame me if we get clobbered in court,\" a corporate general counsel says. \"I hire the biggest name and pay them what they ask. I\\'ve got to protect myself.\"  Allen Cleveland, senior vice president and general counsel of Conoco Inc., says companies\\' in-house lawyers are under a lot of pressure to contain costs these days. \"But in a bet-the-company situation like Texaco-Pennzoil,\" he says, \"you\\'re going to give everyone a blank check.\"  Among the most prominent names in high-stakes litigation is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York. The 700-lawyer firm, which is highly respected for its expertise in takeover law, recently raised its rates as much as 25%. (See accompanying chart.)  Skadden notes that it hadn\\'t raised rates in two years. But a spokesman also concedes that its hourly rates are merely \"a starting point.\" Skadden and many other big firms that specialize in large transactions frequently charge clients a premium for work on matters that are especially difficult or that require around-the-clock attention.  In such cases, it isn\\'t unusual for clients to pay double or triple the regular hourly rate. Says Peter Mullen, a Skadden partner: \"There are some clients who want per-hour calculations, but not many. Most of them just say, \\'I want results.\\'\"  Indeed, it is rumored that some firms in New York at times dispense entirely with lengthy bills and detailed per-hour calculations. Clients reportedly get a one-page bill on which is written a single line. It begins \"For Services Rendered\" and ends with a lot of zeros.  Only a handful of law firms can afford to be so arrogant. In fact, outside the ranks of the majors, many small and midsized law firms are now struggling to stay afloat. Over time, their market has eroded as corporate clients have taken routine matters in-house and assigned serious problems to big firms. But the smaller firms still face rising costs.  Several law firms have collapsed in recent months: Sage Gray Todd &amp; Sims, one of the oldest on Wall Street, and Memel, Jacobs &amp; Ellsworth in Los Angeles. Other firms have been forced to merge.  The increases in billing rates by the majors may further roil an already unstable market. Armed with additional capital, industry specialists say, the top-tier firms will be able to raid smaller rivals more easily, dangling big-money offers before the small firms\\' superstars.  Moreover, many expect the technological gap between the groups to continue to widen. Many major firms are investing heavily in state-of-the-art computer and telecommunications systems that enable them, for instance, to research legal issues faster and more completely. The financially strapped smaller firms are unable to invest in the technology that could make them more efficient and competitive.  \"You\\'re seeing the emergence of the haves and the have-nots in the legal profession,\" says Ward Bower of the legal consulting firm Altman &amp; Weil in Haverford, Pa. \"The gap is growing every year.\"  ---  TIME IS MONEY Hourly rates charged by New York-based Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom: 1987    1986 Senior partners           $350    $300 Junior partners            200     170 Senior associates          200     160 Junior associates           95      85 ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0082': 'The Sec\\'s Fight With Itself</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Everyone is worried about where the Securities and Exchange Commission\\'s \"insider-trading\" cases are headed. We\\'ve warned that the vague definition could be used to punish anyone who has more information than someone else, a recipe for market disaster. We\\'re not alone. The people who best know the mind-set of the agency\\'s lawyers are the SEC\\'s economists. And they are going public with their horror over the SEC\\'s enforcement strategy.  The Office of the Chief Economist last week presented the lawyers down the hall with a study titled, \"Stock Trading Before the Announcement of Tender Offers: Insider Trading or Market Anticipation?\" The economists warned that busting arbitragers and bankers shouldn\\'t be used to chill the legitimate market for information. Market anticipation of takeovers, reflected in price rises before tenders are announced, is almost entirely based on factors aside from illegal insider trading.  The study was aimed squarely at SEC legal chief Gary Lynch. In the name of \"equal information,\" Mr. Lynch has said he\\'ll go after insider trading until there is no more run-up in share price before the announcement of a tender offer. Gregg Jarrell, who was the SEC\\'s chief economist until he recently left to teach at the University of Rochester, told us he warned Mr. Lynch that run-ups do not necessarily mean insider trading. \"When Gary sees the price creep up, he sees evil,\" Mr. Jarrell says. \"I see the ferreting out of valuable information as a sign of the efficient market.\"  Dormant conflicts within the SEC erupted with this study. The enforcement division managed to block publication of the study\\'s planned appendix titled, \"The Law of Insider Trading.\" Written by Jeffry Netter, a lawyer on the economics staff, the appendix began, \"The legal definition of illegal insider trading is somewhat ambiguous.\" It went on to say that \"what should be remembered at the outset is that most trades involving asymmetric information do not violate insider trading laws.\" This was too hot to handle because it showed that the SEC\\'s flat-out attack on \"nonpublic\" information is legally groundless.  The study the SEC actually allowed to be made public supports the economists\\' view. The report identified three major causes of pre-bid trading. These are rumors reported on the Dow Jones ticker and in this newspaper, the size of the bidder\\'s \"foothold\" acquisition and whether the takeover was hostile or friendly. A study of 172 big takeovers between 1981 and 1985 showed these factors led to a run-up before the formal bid of nearly 40% of the premium price.  This was not surprising. Consider the following:  (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ March 19, 1987.)  This graph shows the average run-up before the public announcement of tender offers between 1962 and 1978. This ground-breaking study by efficient-market, random-walk economists at the University of Chicago jibes completely with the more recent findings of the SEC economists.  The following graphical bird\\'s-eye view shows the mischief of Mr. Lynch\\'s aggressive stance against information:  The Efficient Market. The price movements of a hypothetical stock shows how depressed share prices rise as traders learn that a family that owns a publicly traded company has begun to bicker, or see heavy trading on the computer tapes. By the time the raider reaches 5% and files its 13D with the SEC, the market understands something is going on. The price keeps rising until the bid succeeds or is dropped.  Gary Lynch\\'s Market. Compare this with the market as Mr. Lynch would apparently have it. Here the enforcers at the SEC have accomplished the goal of takeover bids taking the market completely by surprise. Equal information means no information. No one learns any information before anyone else, even through legitimate research. The share price is flat up to the announcement of the tender offer. The 90-degree angle shows the perfect absence of market forces to point to the true value of shares.  Costs of Noninformation. Overlaying the efficient market with Gary Lynch\\'s market shows the costs to market efficiency if the SEC ever managed to end price run-ups. The shaded area measures the misallocated capital. The shares are really worth more, but no one -- not arbitragers or pension-fund managers -- knows it because the SEC makes knowing more than someone else an indictable offense.  The SEC economists concluded that trying to end the price run-up is dangerous. \"Legitimate research gives some traders informational advantages and their earnings serve as compensation for their efforts,\" the report says. Their trading \"aligns actual stock prices with their theoretically correct values, improving the allocation of scarce capital between competing uses.\"  Fully \"Lynched\" Market. If Mr. Lynch is serious about equal noninformation, he might be surprised by what he actually would get if the SEC completely chilled information gathering. Investors would flee the markets. We hope one irony won\\'t be lost on Mr. Lynch -- the downward slope of share prices would be completely vertical except that the information market would by then no longer be efficient enough to funnel even this valuable information very quickly into the market.  Mr. Lynch can assure the markets that his prosecutions won\\'t go this far by supporting a definition of insider trading that protects all non-stolen information. Until he does, it\\'s clear the SEC\\'s economists have a better understanding of markets than do its lawyers. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0080': 'Some Master Limited Partnerships Offer High Yields but Post Poor Total Returns --- By Barbara Donnelly Special to The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> Combine the tax advantages of a partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded stock, and the result is a master limited partnership promising high yields.  But while such partnerships are one of the hottest new investment twists, the returns may fall far short of what investors expect. The reason, analysts say, is that investors are focusing too much on yield, ignoring whether the underlying business can really support such high payouts.  \"There are some very attractive MLPs out there with good appreciation potential,\" says Oscar S. Schafer, general partner at Cumberland Associates, a New York investment-management firm. But others, he says, \"are wildly overpriced.\"  Master limited partnerships made their debut with oil-and-gas offerings in 1981, but any company can be organized or reorganized into such a partnership. New offerings have come in industries as diverse as restaurants and nursing homes, shopping centers and cable TV, forest products and mortgage banking.  Excluding oil-and-gas offerings, there were 34 such partnerships valued at about $5 billion at the end of 1986, twice the year-earlier figures, according to Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks partnerships.  The partnerships are able to pay high yields, in part, because they aren\\'t subject to corporate income taxes -- the partners pay individual taxes on their share of the profit. A plus for some individuals is that gains are often classified as so-called passive income, which can be offset with passive tax-shelter losses under the new tax act -- at least under current Treasury Department interpretations.  Investment bankers specializing in such partnerships say that in order to be competitive an issue must offer a current return of 9% to 10%. But a partnership with a current annual yield of 9% may not actually return that much to investors when changes in the value of the underlying assets are taken into account.  Indeed, as the accompanying table shows, yield and return can be very different, depending on the partnership\\'s structure and its effect on underlying assets.  \"The best advice is to forget the yield,\" says Daniel R. Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"These securities aren\\'t bonds, they represent an equity interest in the assets of a business, and they should trade on cash flow -- and whether that cash flow is growing.\"  The biggest pitfall for an investor who is distracted by yield and ignores the nitty-gritty details -- many of which are buried in footnotes of long and complex offering documents -- is taking on substantial risks without realizing them.  \"The problem is that his MLP may be a wasting asset, and he may not know it,\" warns Anne E. Mengden, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. In a \"wasting-asset\" partnership, the declining value of the underlying assets offsets the payout, reducing the total return and sometimes even eroding an investor\\'s principal.  Whether a partnership has declining assets may be obvious -- as with oil and gas offerings based on depleting petroleum reserves. But any partnership that lacks sufficient cash flow to cover its distributions presents the same problem for investors: Over time it will at least partially liquidate itself to sustain its current yield. As a result, investment bankers and analysts say, scrutinizing the source and stability of the funds used for distributions is essential.  It\\'s also important to evaluate each partnership\\'s own particular business situation and prospects. In the end, those active in the field note, it is these factors that will determine the partnership\\'s ability to sustain a high current yield.  Take two different cases where a company converts to a master limited partnership but otherwise continues to operate as before. In a mature company, a big rise in its payout to investors after conversion may simply signify that it has become a cash cow and that management prefers to distribute the money rather than invest in new businesses or risk a takeover.  On the other hand, if the company is still vibrant and expanding, paying out the high level of cash flow required to make the partnership attractive may come at the expense of future growth; the company probably should be reinvesting that income in the business instead.  One rule of thumb Mr. Lee suggests in valuing master limited partnerships is to compare them with corporations in similar businesses, looking at the ratio of market capitalization to cash flow after interest expense. A slightly higher valuation should be allowed for the partnerships because of their advantageous tax status.  Mr. Lee also distinguishes between captive partnerships -- in which the general partner still has control through a sale-leaseback arrangement -- and freestanding ones. An example of a captive partnership is the one offered last year by Burger King Corp., which bundled up $85 million of real-estate leases. New franchises after the offering weren\\'t included, which means the value of the partnership\\'s leases may not fully share in Burger King\\'s growth; in fact, partnership outlets could end up in competition with new franchises.  \"Down the road, free-standing MLPs should do better because there\\'s no conflict of interest and their growth rate is likely to be higher,\" says Mr. Lee.  Even when a partnership appears to be a healthy, free-standing enterprise, it may be borrowing from the future to pay the present with subtle financial tricks.  One example is a partnership that is heavily financed with zero-coupon debt. This helps increase cash flow and yield in early years because interest payments are deferred until the securities mature. But those chickens come home to roost. \"If you put a lot of zero financing in, there may not be any money left over to return to investors after the debt\\'s paid,\" warns Ms. Mengden of Salomon Brothers.  In other cases, fees to the general partner may be subordinated in the early years. But if cash flow doesn\\'t increase enough to cover those accumulating obligations, they may have to be paid for by cutting future payouts.  External risks must be considered, too, because unlike regular partnerships, master limited partnerships are subject to the vagaries of the stock market. \"An MLP might intrinsically be a great asset value, but you don\\'t know what the stock market is going to be like when you want to get out,\" Ms. Mengden says.  An attractive, sustainable yield would help defend an offering\\'s price in a bear market.

       " 'WSJ870319-0079': 'IBM\\'s Akers Took 3.2% \\'86 Pay Cut Due to Profit Drop</HL> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN> International Business Machines Corp.\\'s dismal 27% decline in 1986 profit prompted pay cuts for its top four executives last year.  IBM\\'s proxy statement for the 1987 annual meeting disclosed a 3.2% cut in cash compensation paid to IBM\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, John F. Akers, and 9% cuts for his three lieutenants. The statement also shows that the political pressure on IBM for its South Africa ties hasn\\'t eased entirely, despite IBM\\'s move to withdraw from the country.  Mr. Akers received cash compensation of $711,900 last year, down from $737,715 in 1985 and far below the more than $1 million earned by his predecessor, John R. Opel, in 1984, IBM\\'s peak earnings year. Cash compensation for Vice Chairman Paul J. Rizzo, one of the lieutanants, fell to $652,576 last year from $721,525 in 1985.  The proxy statement also shows that the compensation of the other two lieutenants, senior vice presidents Dean P. Phypers and George B. \"Spike\" Beitzel, dropped 9.6% and 9.3% respectively to $563,597 and $551,342. Both men retired from IBM earlier this year.  The proxy statement indicates pay fell an average of 9% for IBM\\'s top 70 or so executives in 1986, when profits declined for the second year in a row -- the first back-to-back retreat for the computer maker since the Great Depression.  \"Since the senior executives are directly accountable for the profitability of the company, their annual cash incentive fluctuates based on attainment of\" earnings targets, the statement says.  In addition to his cash compensation, Mr. Akers was awarded 3,025 IBM shares, valued at $442,406 based on yesterday\\'s closing stock price of $146.25, for his performance in 1985 -- when earnings fell. He will receive those shares upon retirement. In 1985 he received fewer shares, 2,713, for his work as president and chief operating officer in 1984 -- when earnings soared.  The stock price was off 87.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The other three top executives received fewer shares in 1986 than the year before. Of the four, only Mr. Akers got new stock options in 1986 -- for 19,202 shares.  On the South Africa issue, the proxy statement says a number of church groups plan to ask shareholders to approve a ban on computer sales to the country. Though IBM has pulled out of South Africa, selling its subsidiary there to an employee trust, the company continues to export computers to its former unit. IBM is opposing the resolution. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0078': 'About Path of the Economy, President --- By Roger Cohen Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> The resignation of Planning Minister Joao Sayad leaves Brazil farther than ever from a coherent domestic economic program and places President Jose Sarney squarely before tough choices that could affect the length of his mandate.  The resignation, which was announced Tuesday, also completes the transfer of all economic power to Finance Minister Dilson Funaro. It was Mr. Funaro\\'s rejection of Mr. Sayad\\'s \"New Economy\" plan -- presented to the president Feb. 20 -- that finally prompted the resignation.  \"I waited for as long as I could to see if the government would act,\" Mr. Sayad said. \"Now, at least, it will be obliged to do something.\"  Confusion, however, reigned over what that might be. For although Mr. Sayad\\'s departure was dismissed by some as insignificant because his influence has been diminished for some months, it nonetheless seemed to mark two crucial changes. While he was there, Mr. Funaro\\'s inaction could be attributed to disputes with Mr. Sayad over policy. At the same time, President Sarney could hedge his bets, using the two economic ministers as alternative formulators of policy. Now, in the words of economist Edmar Bacha, \"both Mr. Funaro and the president are completely exposed.\"  Several sources said this could put strains on their hitherto harmonious relationship. Mr. Funaro is known to want to formalize his control over economic policy by creating and heading an Economy Ministry. This would involve either the complete suppression of the Planning Ministry, or its subjugation to a minor role. But it is not yet clear whether President Sarney is prepared to accept this move, which would amount to an overwhelming commitment to Mr. Funaro.  \"If the president wants to go with Mr. Funaro all the way, he may sink with Mr. Funaro all the way. That\\'s what he\\'s up against now,\" said Lawrence Pih, a top Sao Paulo businessman.  Senior New York bankers said Mr. Funaro and President Sarney are much more vulnerable because of Mr. Sayad\\'s resignation, and will be held responsible for any more deterioration in the economy. Several U.S. bankers and economists, who declined to be identified, said that mounting domestic pressure may, within the next six months, force Mr. Funaro to resign. They claim Mr. Funaro is the biggest obstacle to negotiations between Brazil and its creditors.  In an interview with this newspaper last Friday, Mr. Funaro conceded he didn\\'t know what measures to adopt against inflation, or when a program might be in place. But pressure to show that Brazil can control inflation is certain to mount over the next two weeks as the March 31 deadline approaches for a decision by banks on whether to maintain $15 billion in trade and interbank credit lines.  Mr. Sayad\\'s economic program aimed at controlling inflation over the next 180 days through a 90-day period of price adjustment, followed by a 90-day period in which prices would have been frozen or strictly controlled. Inflation last month totaled 13.9%, down from 15% a year earlier and 16.8% in January.  In the Sayad plan, other measures included the elimination of wage-price indexation, a tight monetary policy, a program of debt-equity conversion, an end to subsidies worth about $2 billion a year and other steps to cut the federal deficit. \"It wasn\\'t a perfect plan, but it was the only one the government had. Now there\\'s nothing but the prospect of further disarray,\" commented a senior officer at an international bank in Brazil.  Although the monthlong obstruction of his plan was the final catalyst for Mr. Sayad\\'s departure, he also clashed with Mr. Funaro over the moratorium.  According to a top Planning Ministry official, this was opposed by Mr. Sayad, who, in the week before its announcement, pleaded several times with the president to delay any action until a domestic economic program was in place and a strategy for debt talks prepared. In the past three weeks, Mr. Sayad\\'s irritation increased, spurred by a sense that the political capital gained by the moratorium -- which might have been used to push through tough economic measures -- has been squandered.  The major banks don\\'t want to walk away from Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the Western world. And privately they say they can afford to wait until Brazil gets its economic house in order -- even if that takes many months.  U.S. bankers make no secret of their impatience with Mr. Funaro. Several bankers recall that it took months and much domestic political pressure to unseat Argentina\\'s economy minister, Bernardo Grinspun, and central bank president, Enrique Garcia Vazquez, in February 1985. Mr. Grinspun had spent the past months opposing an accord with the International Monetary Fund, which was finally negotiated by his successor, Juan Sourrouille, then planning minister. He also had opposed Mr. Sourrouille\\'s negotiations with the country\\'s creditor banks.  Despite its public hostility to the IMF, Brazil is quietly staying in touch with that agency. Its ambassador to Washington, Marcilio Marques Moreira, last Saturday dined with Michel Camdessus, the new IMF managing director, and with Alexandre Kafka, Brazil\\'s director at the IMF.  But a return to the IMF would only be conceivable if Mr. Funaro left office. Thus, the president is facing a difficult choice, and the delay in naming a successor to Mr. Sayad seems to reflect this. For the nomination may well provide an indication of the degree of his faith in Mr. Funaro. And if he commits himself now to the finance minister, he will be committed also to the upshot of the moratorium, as well as to a domestic economic policy which remains an unknown.  Some analysts contend Mr. Funaro\\'s policies will only lead to hyperinflation, recession and international isolation. In that case, President Sarney\\'s six-year mandate -- already a hotly debated subject in the newly elected Constituent Assembly -- would probably be curtailed, these analysts say.  --- Peter Truell in New York contributed to this article.  --- Economy Grew 8.2% in \\'86 RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil\\'s gross national product grew 8.2% in 1986, slower than 1985\\'s 8.3% expansion, the government said.  Gross national product measures a nation\\'s output of goods and services.  Industry led last year\\'s expansion, with 12.1% growth, while the service sector grew 8.3%. However, the farm sector contracted 7.3%.  President Jose Sarney has said Brazil will seek to maintain a 5% to 6% growth rate through the rest of this decade. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0076': 'Lerner Gets Hometown Bank\\'s Interest --- By Gregory Stricharchuk Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> Alfred Lerner, a financial and real estate executive who started out as a furniture salesman, boasts between puffs on a fat cigar that he keeps a low profile. \"I\\'m not Joe Tycoon,\" he says, and apologizes for the smoke.  For the most part, 53-year-old Mr. Lerner has done a good job keeping his head down. Until this week, that is, when he disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he and a minority partner, Peter B. Lewis, bought a 9.6% stake in AmeriTrust Corp. for $81.1 million.  Mr. Lerner is chairman and controlling stockholder of Equitable Bancorp., a Baltimore-based bank holding company, and chairman and chief executive officer of Realty ReFund Trust, a Cleveland-based real estate investment trust. Mr. Lewis is chairman and chief executive officer of Progressive Corp., a Cleveland insurance holding company specializing in high-risk auto and motorcycle coverage.  Messrs. Lerner and Lewis are not members of the city\\'s establishment, and suddenly the banking and business community here is asking itself what lies ahead for AmeriTrust Corp., whose lead bank, AmeriTrust Co., is the bank of the area\\'s blue-chip companies and was Ohio\\'s largest until it was topped by holding companies more aggressive in acquisitions.  In his expansive office with a panoramic view of Lake Erie, Mr. Lerner, the son of a New York candy store owner, shrugs off the notion that he intends to personally operate AmeriTrust Corp. He also won\\'t say whether he intends to purchase the rest of the company\\'s shares, valued at about $968.2 million.  \"It\\'s a passive investment. Passive investors don\\'t do anything but act passive,\" he says, smiling. He won\\'t say how or when he will cash in his AmeriTrust stake. \"There\\'s absolutely no pressure. We could be there for an hour to 100 years.\"  Most of the speculation revolves around the attractiveness of AmeriTrust to an out-of-state bank seeking a foothold in Ohio. Wall Street reacted to the news of Mr. Lerner\\'s stake by sending the price of AmeriTrust stock up $8.50 since the SEC filing. It closed yesterday at $51.50, up 50 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.  \"He\\'s probably holding it (the stake) to see what orchestrates,\" says Edward B. Brandon, president of National City Corp., another bank holding company based here. \"Naively you can say AmeriTrust has a new holder that hasn\\'t asked for anything,\" says Mr. Brandon, who is an acquaintance of Mr. Lerner\\'s. \"But it raises questions about its ultimate control.\"  Mr. Lerner said in the SEC filing that he intends to buy additional AmeriTrust shares. Other bankers here speculate that if he gets a controlling position at AmeriTrust, he will seek a suitor for the Ohio bank, possibly a major New York bank.  AmeriTrust, which has total assets of $11.1 billion, has a commanding 36% of Cleveland-area deposits, a strong capital structure and good relationships with leading area businesses. Its dominance of the Cleveland market would make it difficult for any of the other major Ohio bank holding companies to take over AmeriTrust because of banking regulators\\' concerns.  Mr. Lerner, through a limited partnership called Maybaco Co., owns 33% of the common stock of Equitable Bancorp., which has total assets of $4.4 billion, but has a 63% voting stake because of his holdings of a Class B stock. He is proud of the rise in return on common shareholder equity to about 18% last year from 7.4% in 1982, the year after he obtained control.  \"I like the banking business,\" he says. \"It\\'s not the easiest thing, but it\\'s not the world\\'s hardest thing either\" to show improved profits in banking.  But AmeriTrust has a respectable earnings record already. Return on shareholder equity last year was 11%, and its 1.03% return on average assets was higher than Equitable\\'s 0.94%.  Mr. Lerner began his business life as a road salesman for furniture manufacturers. His territory included Cleveland, where he became intrigued with real estate. Beginning with $8,000 in the mid-1960s, he accumulated substantial holdings of apartment buildings. He still has major investments in apartments here and in the Baltimore area.  His first public enterprise was Realty ReFund Trust, which specializes in refinancing established office buildings and other properties. He also owns Reafund Advisors Inc., the REIT\\'s financial adviser. Realty ReFund Trust began selling stock to the public in 1971.  Mr. Lerner is using the name Clevebaco for the AmeriTrust partnership. He acknowledges that the similarity to the Maybaco name used in the Baltimore acquisition arises from superstition. \"It worked the first time, so it might work again,\" he says.  His prominence at Cleveland Browns football games, which he regularly attends, arises from superstition too, but not his own. \"He\\'s as indispensable as Bernie Kosar (the quarterback),\" says his friend Art Modell, the team\\'s owner, who keeps Mr. Lerner at his side as a good luck charm. However, the charm works only so long as Mr. Lerner doesn\\'t light his cigar, says Mr. Modell. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0075': '$2.5 Billion Plan To Fight Acid Rain --- By Ellen Hume Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ENVIRONMENT (ENV) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> President Reagan, reviving a U.S. commitment to combating acid rain, announced he will ask Congress to approve a new $2.5 billion, five-year plan to deal with the problem.  The measure represents an attempt to please Canada before President Reagan\\'s summit in Ottawa next month with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who yesterday praised the plan as \"an important and helpful step.\"  U.S. environmentalists attacked the proposal, however, calling it misguided because it earmarks funds for research on new technology rather than using current technology, as West Germany has been doing, to reduce sulfur emissions through existing equipment such as \"scrubbers.\"  The plan closely follows recommendations that were made last spring by envoys from the U.S. and Canada, and endorsed by Messrs. Mulroney and Reagan. Despite that endorsement, Mr. Reagan\\'s budget proposal for acid-rain programs in fiscal 1988 originally was far lower than the Canadians had hoped.  The new plan will seek to spend $500 million a year for the next five years to fund innovative projects that would reduce sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants. For fiscal 1988, the administration will ask Congress to approve another $300 million above the $50 million in the January budget proposal. These funds would be in addition to the $150 million already approved by Congress for fiscal 1988, which begins next Oct. 1.  Private industry also will be asked to spend at least the same amount on innovative pollution-control technology, according to the president\\'s statement yesterday.  In addition, Mr. Reagan directed Energy Secretary John Herrington to establish an advisory panel of state, federal and Canadian officials to select which projects will be funded. Vice President George Bush\\'s regulatory relief task force will review federal and state regulatory programs to examine tax and other incentives that can assist in the emission-control efforts, the statement said.  The efforts are aimed at controlling the problem of acidic rain, snow or fog that results after pollutants are emitted from electric power plants, factories and automobiles.  Canadian officials praised the new proposal but said they would prefer that the U.S. establish an actual emissions-control program that would curb sulfur emissions by 50%.  Michael McCloskey, Sierra Club director, charged that the new spending \"will not reduce acid rain by a single drop\" because it is for research rather than actual emission control. He called the plan \"a smokescreen to obscure the administration\\'s opposition to acid rain control.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0073': 'Are Linked to Alleged Inside Traders --- By Gary Putka and Michael W. Miller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said it is investigating loans of more than $1 million made by its London banking unit to a member of an investor group that included Israeli financier David Sofer, who was accused by the U.S. government last week of being a central figure in a massive insider-trading scheme.  Merrill Lynch said it is seeking to determine whether the loans are linked to the alleged insider trading by Mr. Sofer and a former top Merrill official in London.  A spokesman for Merrill Lynch in London said the company is conducting \"a full internal investigation\" of two loans totaling more than $1 million that Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd. made to Michael J. Floersheim, a member of the Sofer group. The group reported the loans in December 1985, when it completed the purchase of a large stake in Ampal-American Israel Corp., a New York finance company that invests in Israel.  The Sofer group waged a hostile but unsuccessful proxy fight last summer for seats on Ampal\\'s board of directors.  Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Sofer and Nahum Vaskevitch, Merrill\\'s former head of mergers and acquisitions in London, with masterminding a huge insider-trading scheme that yielded more than $4 million in illicit profits. The SEC charged that the scheme began in late 1984, a year before the Sofer group reported the Ampal purchases, which were partly financed by the Merrill Lynch loans.  The dissident Ampal group\\'s filings with the SEC say Merrill made the loans to finance purchases by Mr. Floersheim, a close associate of Mr. Sofer. Mr. Floersheim, a wealthy Swiss metals trader, is described in the Ampal group\\'s SEC filings as the sole shareholder of Plenmeer Ltd., a corporation the group used to make part of its Ampal purchases. Plenmeer also was named a defendant in the SEC action.  The SEC charged that Plenmeer was the vehicle for many of Mr. Sofer\\'s alleged inside trades, which the commission said were based on leaks from Mr. Vaskevitch about takeovers in which Merrill played a role. The SEC said Mr. Floersheim refused to testify in its insider-trading investigation and, as a Swiss resident, couldn\\'t be subpoenaed. Mr. Floersheim hasn\\'t been charged with any wrongdoing.  Among the things Merrill is trying to determine is whether Mr. Vaskevitch had a role in obtaining the loans for Mr. Floersheim and the circumstances under which the loans were granted. Merrill officials said the loans have been repaid, although they couldn\\'t immediately say when.  The Ampal proxy fight involved many of the same people mentioned in the SEC insider-trading complaint. Besides Mr. Sofer and Mr. Floersheim, the insurgent shareholder group included Louis Barnett, a Fort Worth, Texas, investor and close associate of Mr. Sofer. The SEC didn\\'t charge Mr. Barnett with any wrongdoing, but its court papers contended that he funded and made profits from some of Mr. Sofer\\'s alleged insider trades. The Ampal purchases weren\\'t mentioned in the SEC suit.  The group bought about 25% of Ampal\\'s common and 16% of the company\\'s Class A stock, spending about $7 million in all. In its SEC filings, the group said Merrill lent Mr. Floersheim $908,500 for one purchase of Ampal stock, and an unspecified amount toward a separate $2.6 million purchase. The Merrill Lynch official in London said the two loans totaled more than $1 million.  The group is believed still to hold its Ampal stake, part of which has dropped in value by about 20%.  In American Stock Exchange trading, Ampal Class A stock closed yesterday at $2, compared with the dissident group\\'s approximate average cost of $2.50 a share. Ampal common isn\\'t publicly traded.  The Merrill Lynch official in London said the bank \"brought an end to the relationship\" with Mr. Floersheim when it discovered its name in the Sofer group\\'s SEC filings in the U.S. Although Merrill Lynch knew the loans were being made to finance Ampal share purchases by Mr. Floersheim, the official said Merrill was originally unaware that the purchases would be used to support a proxy fight.  \"We don\\'t finance hostile actions toward companies and we were pretty upset when our name came up\" in the filings, he said. He added that the loans were fully collateralized by Mr. Floersheim.  Messrs. Sofer, Vaskevitch and Floersheim didn\\'t return calls seeking comment.  Ampal is controlled by Bank Hapoalim, one of Israel\\'s largest banks. The insurgent shareholder group didn\\'t directly state its reasons for the proxy fight in its SEC filings, but a letter from Mr. Barnett to Ampal\\'s president after the fight suggested that Ampal split into two companies, reduce its overhead, and become more entrepreneurial.  Lawyers for Messrs. Sofer and Barnett wouldn\\'t comment on the Ampal proxy fight and Merrill Lynch\\'s role in it. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0072': 'It Plans to Sell Its 32% BP Stake --- Holding in the Oil Company Is Valued at $7.7 Billion At Current Share Price --- By Paul Hemp Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> The British government said it plans to sell its remaining 32% stake in British Petroleum Co. in the year ending March 31, 1988. The stake is currently valued at about $7.7 billion.  The government said the sale would be \"subject to market conditions,\" but it didn\\'t specify how the shares would be sold. It said details would be announced later.  The sale presumably is contingent on the ruling Conservative Party\\'s winning the next election. A national vote must be held before June 1988 but is expected sometime this year.  In September 1983, the government sold a 7% stake in BP, which owns 55% of Standard Oil Co. of the U.S., for $908.5 million in an underwritten tender offer. After underwriting costs, the government received about $868 million from the sale.  In 1914, the government owned 67% of BP, but its stake has been declining since.  Revenue from selling the 32% stake would help the Conservatives stay on schedule in their recently accelerated program of selling state assets. The government plans to shed assets valued at about $27 billion during the next three years.  When plans to denationalize the country\\'s water industry were postponed last July, the government had said that the shortfall could be made up by selling its stake in either BP or its 49% holding in British Telecommunications PLC.  Norman Lamont, the Treasury financial secretary, said it is the \"government\\'s policy to sell its minority holdings in companies as, and when, circumstances permit.\"  At BP\\'s share price yesterday of $13.31, up five cents from the day before, on London\\'s stock exchange, the government\\'s sale of 578.5 million shares would be valued at $7.7 billion.  In December 1986, the government sold British Gas PLC, a gas utility, for $9 billion in the largest public offering ever. And it has already announced two other sales for this year.  Rolls-Royce Ltd., which makes aircraft engines, is to be sold to the public this spring. BAA PLC, the British Airports Authority, which runs Heathrow and Gatwick airports, is scheduled to be sold this summer. The two sales are expected to net the government about $800 million each.  In 1986, BP\\'s earning slumped 25%, to $802.4 million from $1.08 billion the year before, after extraordinary charges of $511.3 million. The charges were mainly related to the restructuring of BP\\'s troubled Standard Oil unit. BP\\'s 1986 sales fell 34%, to $43.69 billion from $65.91 billion.  Mr. Lamont\\'s announcement of the sale in the House of Commons late last night was made after the London and New York stock exchanges had closed, apparently to avoid disrupting the markets.  In his comments, Mr. Lamont said the government\\'s denationalization program had gone a long way toward boosting the number of individual shareholders in Britain. He said the total has nearly tripled, to about 8.5 million -- or 20% of the country\\'s adult population -- since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0071': 'Fairness Doctrine Is Subject of Debate --- Congress Is Seeking to Make Broadcasting Rule a Law; FCC Chief Opposes It --- By Bob Davis Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PUBLISHING (PUB) CONGRESS (CNG) FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) </IN> Lawmakers took their first shots in what is likely to be a battle to make the Federal Communications Commission\\'s fairness doctrine a law.  \"We are moving forward today to assure (the doctrine\\'s) continuation,\" said Sen. Daniel Inouye, (D., Hawaii), chairman of the Commerce Committee\\'s communications panel, during hearings on a bill he co-sponsored to codify the doctrine.  The doctrine, which requires broadcasters who air controversial topics to give opponents the chance to respond, has become entangled in a regulatory, legislative and judicial thicket.  Last fall, a U.S. appeals court panel ruled that the fairness doctrine wasn\\'t a law, freeing the FCC to repeal it. Later, FCC Chairman Mark Fowler indicated he would like to eliminate the doctrine, which he views as unconstitutional, before he resigns this spring.  Mr. Fowler\\'s sentiments have spurred Congress into action. In the Senate, Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.), introduced a bill to codify the doctrine. The measure was co-sponsored by Sen. Inouye and Sen. John Danforth, (R., Mo.), the committee\\'s ranking minority member. \"Mark Fowler wants to leave us a going-away present,\" Sen. Hollings said at the hearing. \"I\\'m not going to accept it.\"  In the House, Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, (D., Mich.) and telecommunications subcommittee chairman Edward Markey (D., Mass.) are expected to introduce a similar bill soon.  At the hearing yesterday, Mr. Fowler called the doctrine \"an enemy of free speech\" because broadcasters shy away from controversial topics, fearing they may be required to give away valuable airtime. \"Editing is what editors are for and government has no right in second-guessing their judgment,\" he added.  Former FCC Chairman Charles Ferris, though, said the doctrine assured that minority viewpoints get airtime. \"It\\'s part of an obligation of broadcasters, so the big and powerful won\\'t dominate,\" he said.  Sen. Robert Packwood, (R., Ore.), a staunch opponent of the fairness doctrine, raised the possibility that the doctrine could be extended to such newspapers as the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which use satellite communications to produce their newspapers. The Supreme Court has held that newspapers are exempt from government-mandated fairness regulations.  Even if Congress codifies the fairness doctrine, the matter isn\\'t likely to be dropped.

The sale of Maple Leaf, which earned $16.3 million (Canadian) last year on sales of $819 million, would be the third major divestiture by Canadian Pacific since last fall. The company said the planned sale is part of its \"continuing program to restructure and simplify its mix of businesses.\"  In October, the transportation and industrial holding concern sold its 52.5% stake in Cominco Ltd., a Vancouver-based lead and zinc producer, for $472 million. In December, it agreed to sell Canadian Pacific Air Lines to Pacific Western Airlines for $300 million, a transaction that was completed recently.  \"It\\'s further evidence that these guys are in the midst of a major reorganization,\" Wilfred J. Hahn, an analyst with Bache Securities Inc., Toronto, said of Canadian Pacific\\'s proposed sale of Maple Leaf Mills.  Canadian Pacific had been criticized in the past for its concentration on cyclical industries including oil and natural gas, forest products, steel products and mining.  Based on Maple Leaf\\'s recent profits, Mr. Hahn estimated Canadian Pacific could receive \"well over $200 million\" for it. That could mean a sizable special gain for Canadian Pacific, as Maple Leaf is on Canadian Pacific\\'s books at an estimated $155 million, he said.  Maple Leaf Mills produces flour for industrial and commercial uses, baked goods and poultry and is involved in rendering. It also markets livestock and poultry feeds and distributes grain through a network of elevators. It is active in Canada and the Caribbean.  Harold Wolkin, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., Toronto, said that even though Maple Leaf is a stable, profitable business, it \"sits alone in the CP conglomerate. It isn\\'t transportation and it isn\\'t resources.\"  Mr. Wolkin welcomed the proposed sale as another positive step in refocusing Canadian Pacific and making it more profitable. He estimated that Maple Leaf could be sold for upward of $300 million.  Canadian Pacific said it retained Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto-based investment dealer, to seek buyers. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870319-0067': 'New York Cement Union in Trusteeship</HL> CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> A federal judge placed the city\\'s primary cement and concrete workers union under trusteeship. The action had been sought by the government, which had alleged the union was dominated by organized crime.  Union officials agreed to the trusteeship in a consent judgment, a move they said avoided lengthy litigation. Trusteeship was part of the aim of a suit filed last summer by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.  U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani characterized the order as \"a major milestone\" in the government\\'s drive to address organized crime\\'s influence in New York\\'s construction industry.  The trustee, a lawyer who has yet to be named, is to oversee certain operations of the 4,000-member District Council of the Cement and Concrete Workers, Laborers International Union of North America.  In addition, 13 current and former officers of the district council and the 1,400-member Local 6A were permanently barred from holding office in either entity; three others were barred for the length of the trusteeship, which is set to run until late 1990.  In several cases, the officers were barred from even belonging to these unions, though none of the officers were prevented from taking positions in the three other New York-area locals overseen by the district council.  Overall, the trusteeship is less sweeping than one imposed on the 7,800-member Teamsters Local 560 in New Jersey last June. In that case, the trustee is effectively running the union.  The New York City trustee, working with the union officers allowed to stay, will have certain rights, including the removal of union officers and shop stewards for organized-crime connections. While the government said the trustee will have the authority to run union elections, it won\\'t be involved in the unions\\' pension funds or collective bargaining.  Attorneys for the unions said the trusteeship agreement represents a compromise, because control of much of the unions\\' activities remains in members\\' hands. While the trustee can veto union expenditures and contracts, he will primarily \"assure the court that union officials are acting within the law,\" according to Stuart Baskin of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, which represents the district council.

       " 'WSJ870319-0066': 'Says Japanese Firms Still Violate Chip Pact --- By Peter Waldman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Micron Technology Inc., rebutting official contentions in Tokyo that Japan\\'s microchip makers are complying with the Semiconductor Trade Agreement, produced evidence purporting to show that Japanese chip dumping continues in Southeast Asia.  The Boise, Idaho-based manufacturer of memory chips, released an invoice dated yesterday that showed that a Hong Kong-based unit of Japan\\'s Oki Electric Industry Co. sold a certain type of memory chip for a price at least 20% below what U.S. executives and industry analysts say is the lowest fair-market value assigned to a Japanese chip maker under the agreement.  Such a sale, if completed, would violate the pact\\'s anti-dumping terms. Dumping occurs when a manufacturer sells products at prices below production costs. Micron has had losses for nearly two years, in part because of aggressive pricing by Japanese competitors.  The evidence, which Micron said it gathered at the request of the Commerce Department, may provide new ammunition for Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who U.S. trade-policy officials say favor retaliatory sanctions against Japanese chip makers found violating the trade agreement.  A meeting of the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled for next week to decide what sanctions, if any, should be imposed on Japanese violators.  Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee increased pressure on the Reagan administration to impose sanctions on the Japanese for violating the semiconductor accord. The panel approved a resolution calling on the president to respond to Japanese violations of the pact. The resolution is expected to be considered on the Senate floor either today or next week.  The chip accord, signed last summer, forbids Japanese chip makers from selling dynamic random-access-memory chips, or D-rams, below certain fair-market values calculated by the Commerce Department. The values are supposed to reflect each Japanese producer\\'s cost of production plus an 8% profit margin. Micron said the invoice price of $1.95 per chip in the Oki sale contrasts with a fair-market value for that company of more than $3 per chip.  Joseph Parkinson, Micron\\'s chairman, said the Oki invoice \"reflects the continuous and intentional violations\" of the trade agreement by Japanese D-ram producers. Mr. Parkinson also blamed Japanese dumping for the layoffs of 50,000 to 60,000 U.S. chip assemblers and for huge losses posted by U.S. companies. \"We either take a step now and retaliate, or we will see the end of D-ram production in the United States followed by other targeting of our industries,\" he said.  Oki officials did not answer repeated phone calls to the company\\'s semiconductor-division offices in San Jose, Calif. ',\n",

Financial details weren't disclosed.  The purchase would create a joint venture the companies said would introduce financial products to the Mitsui group's customers in Japan. Security Pacific is a bank holding company, and Mitsui is Japan's second-largest trading company with an estimated $98.7 billion in sales estimated for the year ending March 31. It manages more than 150 overseas offices.  In the past year or so, Mitsui has entered the financial services field, to help offset the effect on the company of the yen's appreciation against the dollar. Mitsui set up financing operations in the U.S. and Australia last year, and its Mitsui &amp; Co. International (Europe) unit recently was converted to a financing company.  Japan Security Pacific Finance, with assets of about $200 million, has operated in Japan since 1978. Like all foreign consumer finance companies in Japan, it encountered severe competition from domestic concerns. Only Security Pacific, Citicorp and Associates Corp. of North America withstood the competition and retain such operations in Japan.  Security Pacific said the joint venture would provide consumer and commercial loans and leases and would market other financial products and services. Included in those services will be loans to finance promissory notes for trading transactions, stock purchases and even for memberships in golf clubs, which can cost more than $100,000 in Japan.  The bank holding company said it would provide the joint venture with its experience in consumer and commercial lending, as well as data-processing support.

       " 'WSJ870319-0064': 'Personal Computer Market Strategy --- By Paul B. Carroll Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN> Xerox Corp. said that it has stopped selling personal computers for general use and that it is selling the units only as part of a desktop publishing system.  Xerox\\'s departure from the stand-alone personal computer business follows years of lackluster results. Xerox\\'s supplier, Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy, has said it shipped Xerox just 35,000 IBM-compatible personal computers in 1985 and 30,000 in 1986. In addition, because of the proliferation of low-priced IBM clones, analysts said Xerox\\'s profit margins on the business have been minimal to nonexistent.  \"They just never became a factor in the business,\" said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"Right from the very beginning, they\\'ve failed.\" Xerox\\'s early work station, called Star, \"was a brilliant technical concept that has been incorporated into Apple\\'s Macintosh and many other systems. Xerox just didn\\'t know how to do that,\" Mr. Glazer added.  Under the change, the Stamford, Conn.-based office-equipment and financial-services company will focus its marketing efforts on its Ventura software package, a highly regarded product that brings to the IBM-compatible world the sort of desktop-publishing capability that has helped make Apple Computer Inc.\\'s Macintosh popular. When buying Ventura, customers will have the option of also buying personal computers, printers and various service packages, with Xerox putting the pieces together into a turnkey system.  Mr. Glazer said Xerox\\'s unit shipments will drop under its new strategy, but said that total revenue from personal computers should change little because the publishing system will cost more. He said Xerox\\'s profit margins should improve because of the additional, more profitable items Xerox is including in the system.  A Xerox spokesman said the move, which took effect last month, is merely \"an evolution of the systems strategy\" and doesn\\'t mean Xerox is getting out of the personal computer business. He said Xerox has always positioned the units in \"a systems setting\" as part of its office-equipment product line.  The spokesman said Xerox is still negotiating with personal computer suppliers on an agreement to replace the one with Olivetti that expired at the end of last year. \"We continue to look at a number of options,\" including a renewed agreement with Olivetti, he said. Tacitly acknowledging that sales have been slower than expected, he added that \"we have enough inventory to last through any period of time.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0063': 'Big Credit-Card War May Be Breaking Out To Detriment of Banks --- American Express 13.5% Rate Is Roiling the Industry; New Tax Law Plays Role --- Do Consumers Really Care? --- By Charles F. McCoy and Steve Swartz Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MNTL UNBC BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The great credit-card war may finally be breaking out.  Despite widespread predictions that free-market forces would one day force major banks into an all-out rate battle for card holders, issuers have long hung on to a fragile truce -- and charged interest rates averaging about 17.8%, far above the cost of other forms of credit. Consumers have basically gone along: One recent study concluded that a quarter of the nation\\'s 82 million card holders didn\\'t know how much interest they were paying.  But the truce is in serious jeopardy: American Express Co. has launched a new revolving charge card, called Optima, that will undercut most Visas and MasterCards by initially offering a comparatively low 13.5% rate on outstanding balances. Distressed, Visa USA Inc. urged some of its bank clients to stop selling American Express traveler\\'s checks.  The American Express foray comes at a critical time. Yesterday, the House Banking Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs approved a bill calling for better disclosure of credit-card terms and limiting interest rates to eight percentage points above the return on one-year Treasury bills; based on that formula, the credit-card rate ceiling would be about 13.8%. Proponents of such legislation say American Express has aided their cause. Optima \"is our first major break,\" says Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who has frequently criticized card rates.  Banks still defend the steep rates, citing the expense of administering millions of card transactions a week, but their ability to hold the line is being eroded by a number of forces. The 1986 tax law will gradually eliminate the deductibility of credit-card interest payments, and the boom in home-equity loans, which remain deductible in many cases, could force card issuers to chase harder after customers. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\\'s Discover card, started in 1985, has sparked other retailers\\' interest in challenging banks for credit-card business. And some states are threatening to impose interest-rate ceilings.  Although few banking experts expect rates to fall much right away, many say the tide has turned against banks trying to cling to their high charges. At the very least, they believe that well-heeled consumers with good credit will soon benefit substantially from lower rates targeted specifically at them. And changing consumer attitudes, spurred by a groundswell of consumer activism, may prod banks into much broader concessions.  \"The jig may be up for a lot of bankers who want to keep rates as high as they are now,\" says Gary Burton, who heads credit-card operations for Liberty National Bank &amp; Trust, Oklahoma\\'s biggest card issuer. \"Competition is catching up with us.\"  Hustling for consumers is a game that banks would rather avoid -- especially now. For years, credit cards have been one of their main profit centers, helping offset damage from bad loans and competitive incursions by other lenders.  Banks say the high cost of administering credit-card loans largely explains why most card rates have dropped only slightly from their 1982 peaks despite a 14-percentage-point decline in the prime rate, the basic lending rate to businesses. Card issuers also want the higher rates to help absorb losses from sometimes-sloppy card underwriting. American Express itself has had its problems; for example, it issued a credit card to Shamoo the cat, the house pet of two Floridians who allegedly used the card and other American Express cards to bilk the financial-services giant out of $80,000.  Even a modest rate war could cost banks dearly. Charles Russell, Visa USA\\'s president, estimates that even if American Express gets only a quarter of the 10 million holders of upscale premium cards to throw out their bank cards in favor of Optima, the banks would lose $1 billion in interest income and $125 million in fees. In a full-scale rate war, the lost profits would be far higher.  So far, banks have been able to build their card portfolios without much price competition by focusing on marketing gimmicks. For example, Citibank offers Citidollars, glorified Green Stamps that can be traded for briefcases, watches and other items. Sears uses a similar \"bonus point\" system to push its Discover card. Preapproved credit lines, low-cost insurance and other frills have been thrown in routinely over the years. First Deposit National Bank, of Tilton, N.H., has been soliciting customers with a mailing that pitches a $5,000 line of credit, an immediate cash loan to pay off other cards and a speedy approval process. In fine print, the interest rate is revealed: 21.9%.  Most consumers haven\\'t been very bothered by the rates they are charged. For one thing, many card users pay their bills promptly and thus don\\'t incur any interest charges anyway. And even people who do borrow on their cards have tended to focus on things such as the size of their monthly payments. A study by Bank Credit Card Observer, an industry newsletter, says that 25% of card holders don\\'t know their card rates and that 60% believe that most banks charge about the same rates. \"I have no idea how much my interest rate is,\" says Suzanne Carver, a Chicago housewife, as she paws through her purse to check her card. \"It doesn\\'t say on here. Well, as long as I can buy things with it, who cares?\"  Banks that have tried to lure customers with low rates haven\\'t set off any stampedes. When Central Bank, of Walnut Creek, Calif., tried to lure new business last summer by paring its rate to 17.76% -- more than three percentage points below the California average -- consumers yawned. \"In four months, we spent $250,000 for advertising and increased our accounts from 24,000 to 26,000,\" says Dennis Buesse, a senior vice president. \"People just didn\\'t care.\" The $1.2 billion bank wound up selling its portfolio and dumping its card business altogether.  Leo Shapiro, a Chicago market researcher, says the psychological salve that consumers get from owning a card can distract them from worrying about rates or looking for bargain cards. \"The great modern nightmare is discovering that you\\'re unrecognized, a nobody,\" Mr. Shapiro says. \"With that card, you can be surrounded by strangers, but you walk up and say, \\'Look what I\\'ve got in my hand.\\' Suddenly, you\\'re a person of importance.\"  But attitudes may be changing. Consumer Action, an activist group based in San Francisco, says that so far this year it has received 9,000 requests for its list of banks with comparatively low rates -- more than in all 1986. It attributes the upsurge to the increased political clamor over high rates and the tax-law change.  Optima may well encourage consumers to get even pickier about credit-card rates. American Express says it decided to start the card because three years of research showed that revolving credit from other sources was used by almost two-thirds of its card holders, who normally are expected to pay the full amount due on their regular American Express cards every month. But its research also showed that many card holders would switch to a new card only if offered sharp reductions of four to six percentage points. A two-point reduction drew little interest in tests.  The card will be promoted to an estimated eight million to nine million American Express card holders, according to Rodney Schwartz, a securities analyst who follows American Express for PaineWebber Inc. American Express expects two million to three million of them to sign on over the next two to three years -- even though the new card will be somewhat more costly than its tantalizing rate would seem to suggest. Holders of the card will pay a $15 annual fee -- about mid-range of what most card issuers charge. Moreover, the interest rate could rise because it is pegged to the prime rate.  Most of the biggest bank-card issuers generally play down the American Express move and the clamor for lower rates. Citicorp, the biggest bank-card issuer, with over nine million accounts, declines comment. However, Charles R. Walsh, an executive vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Corp., which has 3.3 million accounts, says, \"We have been and will continue to compete effectively.\" And a spokesman for First Chicago Corp., which will become the third-largest bank issuer of cards when it completes an acquisition later this year, says: \"Those who feel the major issuers charge too much simply don\\'t understand the business.\"  One reason Optima could reshape the credit-card business is that American Express is the first high-profile card issuer with national marketing muscle to introduce a low-rate card. Beyond that, its foray into revolving credit -- in which the card holder must make only a minimal payment each month -- further blurs the once-well-defined line between banks and other financial-service companies. In the case of credit cards, the barriers have muted rate competition because few banks wanted to risk provoking a price war.  \"American Express is the 500-pound gorilla that consumers have been waiting for,\" says Elgie Holstein, the director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Washington-based consumer group. The company, he adds, \"has the coast-to-coast marketing muscle to go head-to-head with Visa and MasterCard and make interest rates an issue.\" Some bankers also believe that banks that have considered lower rates may now try to jump on the bandwagon.  The first spoils probably will go to upscale consumers with solid credit records. Already, signs of a two-tiered approach are cropping up. Citicorp, for example, recently cut rates for its \"preferred\" customers to 16.8%. The rate for everyone else: 19.8%.  \"Rates will come down in dribs and drabs, and you\\'ll see it mainly on the preferred side,\" says James McDermott, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.  But the mass market is showing signs of agitation as well. \"It\\'s just real distressing to know you\\'re being gouged,\" says Andy Denemark, a programming director for NBC Radio Entertainment in New York. He is hoping to replace his 19.8% card with a cheaper one from a bank in Arkansas or Connecticut. Ronald Albers, a warehouse supervisor in Dallas, says he has essentially stopped using his credit cards, one of which carries a 22% rate. \"That\\'s just a rip-off,\" he declares.  The tax-law change that phases out credit-card deductions makes the high rates even more painful, but the impact of the change will be softened by its gradual introduction. The curb on the deduction will be phased in over five years, with 35% of such deductions disallowed in 1987, 60% in 1988, 80% in 1989, 90% in 1990 and 100% in 1991. Moreover, not all credit-card borrowers will be affected; Internal Revenue Service data indicate that only 38% of taxpayers itemized deductions on their 1984 returns. On the other hand, itemizers tend to be heavy borrowers; in 1984, they claimed $53.9 billion in interest deductions on loans other than mortgages.  Meanwhile, the booming market in home-equity loans and other new credit plans gives consumers seeking relief plenty of options. Bruce Bretland, a real-estate broker in Evanston, Ill., says that partly because of the tax law, he has been leaving his credit cards in his wallet and paying cash. \"The saying this past Christmas was to go plastic-free. I think a lot of people have been cutting back,\" he says.  Home-equity loans pose a particular menace to the credit-card business, financial managers say. The loans -- revolving credit secured by a homeowner\\'s equity -- often carry interest rates as low as 7.5%, and much of the interest is still deductible. The market for such loans is expected to mushroom from about $50 billion now to some $300 billion by 1990, and that growth may come largely at the expense of high-priced plastic. Moreover, two weeks ago, State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., of Boston, unveiled what amounts to a home-equity credit card -- a 12.5% card collateralized by a customer\\'s home.  \"Many consumers are using equity lines to consolidate their credit cards or to shorten payment periods,\" says Randall Sanada, a financial planner in Chatsworth, Calif. \"Banks will have to drop rates to compete.\"  Competitive pressure is also coming from thrifts. Latecomers in the game, savings and loan associations had puffed up their credit-card loans to $6.5 billion by last Sept. 30, the latest figure available; that was nearly triple the level two years earlier. Thrifts such as Chevy Chase Savings Bank in Chevy Chase, Md., are offering rates as low as 14%.  Some smaller banks also are luring customers with rock-bottom rates. Simmons First National Bank, of Pine Bluff, Ark., barred by state law from charging more than five percentage points above the Fed\\'s discount rate, charges only 10.5% interest but still turns a profit. It does so by being highly selective about whom it issues cards to, by funding the business with cheap local deposits and by taking advantage of its low overhead. Its card loans have grown more than 30% in the past year to $58 million, with about 60% of the new accounts coming from out of state, says Thomas Paxton, a vice president.  All told, banks held about $91.9 billion in credit-card loans at year-end. First Chicago derived about 30% of its $272.2 million 1986 profit from consumer loans, mostly credit cards. But although profits have been good, delinquency rates and writeoffs have reached record levels, in many cases far outstripping banks\\' expectations. For banks with more than $300 million of assets, credit-card charge-offs hit a record $2.5 billion last year, up 56% from 1985.  The most immediate threat to banks\\' current card practices, however, may come from angry government officials. In addition to the action in Congress yesterday, officials in California, Iowa and Tennessee and elsewhere have called for state laws curbing rates. The treasurer of Illinois tried to punish First Chicago for its high credit-card rates by withdrawing state deposits from the bank.  Meanwhile, some consumers are fighting back on their own. James K. McEldowney, a Beverly Hills, Calif., real-estate man who carries 53 credit cards, says he has had enough of West Coast banks charging 21%; he got a 10% card from an Arkansas bank. Of his other cards, he says: \"One of these days, I\\'m going to decorate my wall with them.\"  ---  The Credit-Card Game: Big Players and Low Rates NUMBER    INTEREST   ANNUAL    INTEREST BANK           OF ACCOUNTS        RATE*     FEE*  FREE DAYS The biggest bank players Citibank         9,000,000       19.8%      $20        30# Bank of America  7,000,000       19.8        18        25# Chase Manhattan  4,186,000       17.5        20        30# First National Bank of Chicago  3,100,000       19.8        20        25# Manufacturers Hanover          3,000,000       17.8        20        25# Wells Fargo**    2,133,000       20.0        18        25# Marine Midland   1,880,000       19.8        15        30# Chemical Bank    1,540,000       19.5        20        25# Banc One         1,365,000       19.8        20        25# Maryland Bank    1,239,000       17.9        18        30# The cheapest bank cards Simmons First National          160,000        10.5%***   $22.50     25# People\\'s             N.A.        11.50       20.00     25@ Manufacturers National             N.A.        13.30***     0.00      0@@ First National Bank of Cincinnati   N.A         13.50***    20.00     25# Republic National 25,000         14.00***    22.00     30# Union National       N.A.        14.20***    20.00      0@ Marine Midland 2,200,000         14.59***    25.00     30@ Manufacturers &amp; Traders          6,000         14.75***    25.00     30# Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust        N.A.         15.00       25.00     25# Rainier National         500,000         15.00***    18.00     25# *For basic accounts during the week of March 1 **Includes accounts of Crocker National Bank ***Variable rate #From date of billing @Interest charged from date of posting @@Interest charged from date of purchase N.A. = not available Sources: American Banker; Bank Credit Card Observer ',\n",

The decision comes the week after the Senate Banking Committee cleared legislation that includes a one-year ban on federal and state regulators granting banks any additional powers.

The Fed had said it would decide by April applications by Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp and J.P.

Approval of those applications would greatly widen cracks in the half-century-old legal barrier separating commercial and investment banking.

The Fed\\'s previous decision involving commercial paper power -- allowing Bankers Trust to place paper through a commercial lending subsidiary -- didn\\'t involve underwriting authority.  Like the Bankers Trust decision, though, the Chase Manhattan decision also directs that Chase Commercial\\'s gross revenue from its commercial paper activities can\\'t exceed 5% of its total gross revenue and that its share of the total commercial paper market can\\'t exceed 5%.  Those restrictions are aimed at circumventing a provision in federal banking law that bars banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System from affiliating with any firm that is \"engaged principally\" in underwriting and dealing securities.  A Chase spokesman in New York termed the Fed\\'s decision \"extremely significant\" because \"it means expanded powers for banks that will lead to increased competition benefiting our customers\" and \"makes for a sounder banking system by allowing banks to diversify their activities.\" He also said the action \"signals the Fed\\'s strong belief that change is essential if bank holding companies are to continue to have a vital role in the financial services industry.\"  The Fed\\'s decision mentions the pending Senate legislation that would ban new powers retroactive to March 6 and extending for one year after the bill becomes law. The Fed, though, noting that the bill isn\\'t yet law, states that \"the Board believes it must proceed to reach a decision on this application.\" The Fed warned Chase that if the ban on new powers is enacted, the bank holding company \"may be required . . . to cease its commercial paper underwriting activities.\"  Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) wants the ban in order to give lawmakers time to study whether banks should be given more powers. His original bill gave bank holding companies new securities powers, but he backed down after Democrats on the committee said they weren\\'t ready to decide the issue.  The legislation is awaiting consideration by the full Senate. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0061': 'Undermine Independent-Counsel Law --- By Stephen Wermiel and Andy Pasztor Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Justice Department officials, who maintain that the independent-counsel law has serious constitutional flaws, face mounting criticism from Congress for undermining the law in other ways.  At a first round of congressional hearings beginning today, the department plans to spell out strong concerns that the position of court-appointed independent counsel may violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. But while providing more detail than in the past about such flaws, administration officials say the department will stop short of flatly saying that the entire law is unconstitutional.  The law in question is the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, which allows the Justice Department to seek counsels to independently prosecute allegations of wrongdoing by high-level federal officials.  The administration apparently hopes to prod Congress to correct any constitutional conflicts in the law without being blamed for undercutting current investigations, such as those involving former White House aide Michael Deaver and the Iran-Contra arms-sale scandal. The law is scheduled to expire in January unless Congress extends it.  But Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), chairman of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that will handle extension of the law, says the constitutional questions aren\\'t the real issue. He says the Justice Department has been \"covertly . . . undermining\" the law \"by misapplying its provisions and stretching beyond Congress\\'s will the department\\'s decision-making authority.\"  Sen. Levin says the department has improperly combined two separate stages of investigation. The law requires the two stages as part of the process of deciding whether an independent counsel should be appointed.  In the first stage, the attorney general reviews whether he has received allegations that are specific and from a credible source. If so, the second step gives the attorney general as long as 90 days for a \"preliminary investigation,\" after which he must report to a special court, either requesting an independent counsel or explaining why one isn\\'t needed. Sen. Levin contends that the department has combined these two steps, hoping to wrap up matters more quickly and avoid reporting to the court in some cases.  Another problem, Sen. Levin contends, is that the department uses the wrong legal standard in deciding whether to ask a court to appoint an independent counsel, making it less likely that the attorney general will request such an appointment. Sen. Levin says the law requires the Justice Department to determine only whether there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe further investigation is warranted, but that the department has narrowed that to \"whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction.\"  Interest in constitutional questions pertaining to the law has increased because of lawsuits filed separately by Mr. Deaver and by Lt. Col. Oliver North, a former national security aide involved in the Iran-Contra affair. Both lawsuits have been dismissed as premature by federal judges, and the Justice Department, which had requested independent counsels in both cases, has avoided taking any position on the law\\'s constitutionality.  However, lawyers for Mr. Deaver, who was indicted on perjury charges yesterday, said they would raise the constitutional issues again by seeking dismissal of the charges.  The congressional hearings give the administration a chance to air its longstanding, sometimes vehement complaints about the constitutionality of the law. But officials said Attorney General Edwin Meese wants to avoid, at least for now, taking a definitive position. \"We will take a firm position on the constitutionality . . . when that\\'s necessary in court, but not before,\" said one administration official. \"If Congress wants to work with us to have a more defensible law, we\\'re ready to cooperate.\"  On the House side, Rep. Peter Rodino (D., N.J.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a leader of a bipartisan coalition defending the constitutionality of the law and urging that it be expanded to cover additional White House and Justice Department officials.  \"It\\'s not in anybody\\'s interest to have these constitutional issues raised,\" in the midst of the Iran-Contra investigation and other probes, according to Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), a Judiciary Committee member. ',\n",

Schlender Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. already has received \"a handful of offers\" to help management finance a leveraged buyout of the company from Schlumberger Ltd.  Donald W. Brooks, Fairchild\\'s president and chief executive officer, however, declined to identify the possible investors, other than to say they weren\\'t other semiconductor companies. \"I\\'ve had several phone calls (offering financing) that I haven\\'t even returned yet,\" he said during a news conference held here to explain Fairchild\\'s options in the wake of Fujitsu Ltd.\\'s decision last Monday to drop plans to acquire the Cupertino, Calif.-based chip company.  Mr. Brooks also said that the Japanese electronics conglomerate, which abruptly withdrew its offer after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldridge and other U.S. officials voiced opposition to the acquisition, wouldn\\'t provide any financing for the proposed management buyout of Fairchild. It had been estimated that Fujitsu was prepared to pay $200 million for 80% of Fairchild; Fairchild didn\\'t estimate the value of the management proposal.  Mr. Brooks said that if Schlumberger, an oil-field services concern controlled by French interests, went along with a management buyout, Fairchild wouldn\\'t shed many assets or spin off any operations.  In New York, Schlumberger didn\\'t rule out the possibility of a management buyout for Fairchild. \"That is among the alternatives we are looking at,\" said Arthur Lindenauer, Schlumberger\\'s financial vice president, declining to elaborate. Schlumberger also said it had retained the services of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to evaluate \"any and all proposals\" concerning the future of Fairchild.  Mr. Brooks said that Fairchild also would consider \"other alternatives\" to a management buyout, but that the main goal would be to \"hold the company together.\" In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing; ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company\\'s operations or sale of its assets.  Mr. Brooks, who asserted that Fairchild and its employees were \"victimized\" by protectionist sentiment in Washington, said it \"was time for Fairchild to go forward to return Fairchild to a prominent position in the semiconductor industry.\" To that end, he described in general terms Fairchild\\'s intent to pursue several joint ventures with Fujitsu to develop technology, to cooperate in manufacturing in both countries and to exchange licenses to make and sell each other\\'s products.  The executive didn\\'t conceal his frustration at the failed merger with Fujitsu, which he contended \"provided an avenue. . .for lessening U.S.-Japanese trade conflicts by providing more jobs in this country and more sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan.\" He accused other U.S. semiconductor company executives of \"creating an air of hysteria\" over Japanese encroachment into the U.S. chip industry. Moreover, he added, \"I still don\\'t think there was as much opposition in the government as was reported.\"  Meanwhile, in Washington, a House panel approved legislation giving the president new authority to prohibit foreign investors from buying U.S. companies.  The Energy and Commerce subcommittee on competitiveness voted 11-2 to authorize the commerce secretary to investigate whether a proposed takeover, acquisition or merger would \"impair the national security and essential commerce.\" Under the measure, the secretary would advise the president of his conclusions within 45 days, and the president then would decide whether to restrict or prohibit the proposed transaction.

William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive officer of GenCorp Inc., has been reshaping the company to resist a potential hostile takeover bid since he joined it in September 1984. Ironically, the assault, when it finally came, caught him on vacation.  After a year of negotiating sales of broadcasting and entertainment properties as part of a restructuring program, Mr. Reynolds left last Friday for an island getaway off the Florida coast. Yesterday, a company plane whisked him back to GenCorp\\'s Akron, Ohio, headquarters to discuss strategy after a partnership consisting of AFG Industries Inc. and Wagner &amp; Brown launched a tender offer of $2.2 billion, or $100 a share, for the company.  Mr. Reynolds, after conferring with investment bankers and lawyers, issued a statement urging shareholders not to make a decision on the offer until March 31. He said the board needs time to finish its evaluation and determine \"whether the offer is in our shareholders\\' best interests.\" The offer is scheduled to expire April 15.  The partnership already holds 2.2 million GenCorp shares, or 9.8% of the 22.3 million outstanding. AFG is an Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker and distributor; Wagner &amp; Brown is a closely held, Midland, Texas-based oil and gas concern.  In an offering circular filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, the partnership said it intends to sell GenCorp\\'s aerospace and soft drink bottling businesses to repay part of the borrowings it would use to finance the offering. The partnership said it planned to keep GenCorp\\'s tires and plastics and industrial products businesses.  The circular said the partnership would temporarily put GenCorp\\'s television and radio stations under the control of a trustee while it seeks Federal Communications Commission approval to assume the broadcast licenses. The trustee would be \"obligated to continue\" GenCorp\\'s \"current policy\" of disposing of the properties, and settling license disputes connected with some of them, according to the circular. It isn\\'t clear whether the FCC would approve such an action while the licenses remain challenged.  The partners said they had contributed $250 million of equity, arranged bank loans under a $1 billion credit agreement with a group of banks led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co., and secured a $1.25 billion bridge loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Management of GenCorp has been aware for years that the value of the company\\'s parts is higher than the market value of GenCorp stock. Unlike neighboring Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., which thought itself too big and ugly to be a takeover target, GenCorp has been trying to prepare its defenses.  Mr. Reynolds won\\'t have an easy task if he attempts to thwart a takeover. GenCorp\\'s stock soared $16 yesterday to close at $106.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, leading analysts to speculate that other suitors may quickly emerge. The stock closed Tuesday, before the bid was made public, at $90.50 a share, a 52-week high and up $2 from Monday.  There also is speculation that the partnership may be seeking \"greenmail,\" a chance to make a quick profit by selling its stock back to GenCorp. However, a spokesman for the partnership denied any such intent. \"General Partners (the partnership) wants to acquire this company,\" the spokesman said.  GenCorp has been girding for a possible takeover fight for at least five years. In 1984, M.G. O\\'Neil, then chairman and chief executive, restructured the company into four subsidiaries that could be readily spun off to shareholders.  It isn\\'t clear, however, whether that defense will be employed. But it appears inevitable that the company will be radically restructured if it isn\\'t taken over and dismembered.  Richard Haydon, managing director of Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc., estimates GenCorp has a break-up value of about $125 to $130 a share. He says \"the crown jewel\" is the Aerojet General unit, which he values at more than $1 billion, or about $47 a GenCorp share. \"Aerojet is what makes the whole thing (a takeover or restructuring) economically viable,\" he says. Aerojet is involved in rocket systems, defense electronics and munitions.  The spokesman for the partnership declined to say specifically whether the group planned to complete the sale of GenCorp\\'s KHJ-TV station in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co. GenCorp earlier this month entered a memorandum of understanding, but not a final agreement, to sell the station to Disney in a complex transaction under which Disney would pay more than $217 million to the Akron company and an additional $103 million to Fidelity Television Inc., an investor group that has been challenging GenCorp\\'s license for the station.  Disney, Fidelity, and GenCorp haven\\'t reached a definitive agreement for the sale, according to William G. Simon, Fidelity president. Mr. Simon said yesterday that he hadn\\'t been contacted by General Partners and didn\\'t know if the sale would be affected by the offer. A Disney spokesman declined to say whether his company was contacted by the partnership.  GenCorp has a definitive agreement to sell its New Jersey TV station, WOR, to MCA Inc. for $387 million.  The broadcasting properties have long been regarded as GenCorp\\'s best defense against a hostile takeover. Licenses for two of the television stations and all the radio stations are being challenged by groups who charge that GenCorp is an unfit operator. The dispute includes allegations that GenCorp failed to adequately inform the FCC of allegedly improper campaign contributions and foreign payments.  GenCorp\\'s core manufacturing businesses, including tires and plastic products, account for about 58% of the company\\'s $3.1 billion of annual sales.  Separately, the partnership filed suit in a U.S. court in Columbus, Ohio, seeking to void GenCorp\\'s previously announced \"poison pill\" rights distribution and to stop holders from voting on a proposal for staggered terms for GenCorp directors at the March 31 annual meeting. As previously reported, the partnership said its tender offer is conditioned upon the cancellation of those anti-takeover measures.  In another development, Standard &amp; Poors Corp. said it placed on its CreditWatch list with negative implications both AFG\\'s $185 million of double-B-plus subordinated debt and GenCorp\\'s $100 million of double-B-plus subordinated debt. Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. also placed the issues under review for a possible downgrade. S&amp;P said AFG\\'s \"demonstrated appetite for substantial acquisitions\" and the prospect of higher debt or \"defensive countermeasures\" at GenCorp could hurt the companies\\' credit quality.  An AFG spokesman declined to comment on the actions. ',\n",

For the first time, makers may not sell out in the U.S.  Bulging inventories of Mazda, Subaru and other models cloud Japanese auto makers\\' chances of selling all 2.3 million cars that can be shipped to the U.S. in the next 12 months. Price increases due to the yen\\'s rise and growing supplies of Japanese models made in the U.S. contribute to the problem. Japanese imports now claim about 20% of the U.S. market, but that market is expected to shrink as much as 10% in 1987, with competition stiffening. \"It\\'s going to be a gut-shoot this year,\" says Toyota Motor Corp. official Jim Perkins.  That prompts Japanese makers to offer incentives and seek market niches. Nissan Motor Co. brings out a minivan and a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. aims at entry-level buyers with a $5,200 Korean-built car. Toyota, sensitive to pricing, tables some proposed high-tech features for new models.  The Japanese may juggle quota allocations for better overall sales, with tiny Daihatsu Motor Co. likely to get an okay to ship its first 10,000 subcompacts.  BRITISH FIRMS ENJOY a Yankee-fueled auto renaissance.  Quality improvements in Jaguar PLC\\'s new models helped increase U.S. sales of British cars 19% last year to 26,200. Sales could double this year, thanks to Sterling, a joint Honda Motor Co.-Austin Rover Ltd. auto. Another new entry: an upscale off-road vehicle by Land Rover UK Ltd.  British auto engineers also are increasing demand for work on expensive, low-volume cars. General Motors Corp. last year snapped up Lotus PLC and gave it much of the engineering work for the next Chevrolet Corvette. British concerns did initial work on GM\\'s 1988 Buick Reatta sports car. Hawtal-Whiting, a British engineering firm, opens a Detroit office this month. The British \"train engineers more broadly,\" says Ralph Miller of Modern Engineering Service Co.; its U.K. affiliate helps with Ford Motor Co.\\'s 1990 Lincoln.  CUSTOMER SATISFACTION becomes the new battleground in car sales.  As price and quality differences between companies narrow, car makers focus on courtesy and service to compete in a tougher U.S. market. Buyer happiness \"indexes\" are in vogue for prodding dealers. Ford used such an index to award Merkur luxury-import franchises; GM\\'s Buick division considers making indexes a basis for distributing new models. Companies are pushing hard because \"no one has a clear competitive advantage in this area,\" says John Middlebrook, head of GM marketing world-wide.  Many dealers protest, but most respond. To improve back-shop and other operations, many buy shop-streamlining computers offered by GM\\'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. subsidiary and others. A Dallas-based cable-TV network aimed solely at dealers adds 200 subscribers a month for its training videos and daily auto-news reports.

WARRANTY WARS, hailed as a consumer boon, pose many risks.  Extended power-train and corrosion guarantees lose their marketing edge as each of the Big Three increases coverage. Once alone in the field, Chrysler Corp. ups its five-year or 50,000-mile power-train guarantee to seven years or 70,000 miles in response to GM and Ford\\'s six-year or 60,000-mile packages. J.D. Power, a California analyst, says GM could add $100 a car in warranty claims -- a three year cost of up to $1.8 billion. Other analysts warn that consumers could ultimately pay for higher warranty costs through price increases.  The warranties also eat into dealer profits by eliminating lucrative markups for selling extra warranty protection and rustproofing. Car makers are refashioning these longer guarantees to make them more attractive. But Ziebart International Inc., Rusty Jones Inc. and other after-market companies, many dependent on rustproofing for more than half their revenues, must scramble to sell more seatcloth protection and other items.

The toy retailer said earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 1 rose 32% to $116.1 million, or 89 cents a share, from $88.1 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Per-share figures reflect a 3-for-2 stock split last June 27.  Sales rose 28% to $1.18 billion from $924 million a year earlier. On a comparable-store basis, sales rose 13%.  The company said the fourth-quarter jump was largely because of strong Christmas and January sales. Michael Goldstein, executive vice president, said the price cutting the company began in January had \"very little effect,\" if any, on fourth-quarter earnings.  The retailer cut prices in January, using the savings it anticipates from lower tax rates as a means of increasing its market share.  Mr. Goldstein said the company hopes the cuts, which it plans to maintain, will help increase earnings in the coming year, but their effect was probably \"very minor\" in the fourth quarter.  Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive officer, said 1986 was \"an excellent year for Toys \"R\" Us in terms of sales, earnings and significant market-share expansion.\"  The company last year opened 38 new toy stores domestically and 11 internationally, as well as 20 new Kids \"R\" Us children\\'s clothing stores.

       " 'WSJ870319-0056': 'Pound\\'s Upward Momentum Continues Despite Drop in British Lending Rates --- By Charles W. Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN> The British pound, lifted higher by the momentum of the recent rally in high-yielding currencies, continued to dominate foreign exchange trading yesterday.  Sterling\\'s rise occured despite cuts in the basic lending rates of British banks yesterday, which resulted in lower yields on pound-denominated deposits. Traders believed that British interest rates are still much more attractive than those in the U.S., West Germany or Japan and that the rate cut ultimately will stimulate economic growth in the United Kingdom.  Sterling\\'s rise was tempered by fears of central bank intervention and remarks yesterday by Britain\\'s chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Buttressing the pound, though, was optimism carried over from Mr. Lawson\\'s annual budget message Tuesday, firmer oil prices and inactivity in the usually more important trading of dollars and West German marks.  The dollar edged higher in quiet trading yesterday.  \"Dollar-sterling and sterling-mark, that\\'s where all the action has been,\" said Victor Polce, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.  \"Aside from sterling, this market has been lethargic,\" Mr. Polce said.  The reduction in British lending rates to 10% from 10.5% was largely expected. That decrease, though, was smaller than what some analysts had predicted a drop of a full point, which may account for sterling\\'s strength in the face of the cut. \"It would take a drop of at least another percentage point to hurt the pound,\" said Robert Cassidy, vice president of foreign exchange at Chemical Bank in New York.  Also, the stimulative effect of the cuts on the British economy was seen as a positive sign for the pound, traders said.  The most negative factor for sterling, traders said, remains the specter of Bank of England intervention in currency markets to halt the pound\\'s appreciation. Such fears were reinforced by Mr. Lawson\\'s remarks to reporters in London yesterday. Although the finance minister said he was \"perfectly content\" with the pound\\'s current level, Mr. Lawson reiterated that he wouldn\\'t like to see a significant strengthening of the pound.  Sterling has risen about 5% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies since the Feb. 22 accord to stabilize exchange rates, struck by U.S. and its five major economic allies at their Paris meeting. The pound\\'s trade-weighted value yesterday stood at 72.6% of its 1975 level, compared with 69.1% on the last trading day before the Paris accord.  Meanwhile, in late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6080, up from $1.6043 Tuesday. Against the bellwether European unit, sterling climbed to 2.9513 marks, from 2.9421.  If Britain\\'s central bank plans to intervene against the pound, it will start selling sterling at or above the $1.6100 level, many traders say. Britain may want a weaker currency to make its products less expensive for foreigners to import, traders note.  In other currency trading, the dollar rose to 1.8354 marks, from 1.8339, and to 151.86 Japanese yen, from 151.78.  In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar inched up against the Japanese currency to 151.88 yen from 151.86 in New York yesterday afternoon.  In New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $405.10 in moderate trading estimated at 2.3 million ounces.

       " 'WSJ870319-0055': 'With Perjury In Ethics Case --- By Andy Pasztor Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ENVIRONMENT (ENV) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) CONGRESS (CNG) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> Michael Deaver, former deputy White House chief of staff and a close friend of President Reagan, was indicted on charges of lying to Congress and a federal grand jury about his lobbying work after leaving government service.  The five-count perjury indictment by the grand jury charges that Mr. Deaver, who left the White House in May 1985 to start a high-profile Washington lobbying firm, lied twice while testifying before a congressional subcommittee and three times while testifying before the grand jury, which investigated whether he violated federal conflict-of-interest laws.  The indictment capped Mr. Deaver\\'s unsuccessful, three-week legal battle -- which went all the way to the Supreme Court -- challenging the constitutionality of the independent counsel who conducted the wide-ranging probe of his business activities. Only hours before, Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected an emergency request by Mr. Deaver\\'s attorneys to block any indictment.  The courts rejected those constitutional challenges on the ground that they were premature, since Mr. Deaver hadn\\'t been charged with any crime. Mr. Deaver\\'s attorneys now are expected to resume their legal battle by seeking to have the indictment dismissed for many of the same reasons.  The indictment among other things, charges that Mr. Deaver falsely testified about contacting senior administration officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and former National Security Advisers John Poindexter and Robert McFarlane, on behalf of corporate clients or foreign governments.  Mr. Deaver, if convicted, faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and up to $34,000 in fines. He is the first person to face criminal charges stemming from an investigation headed by a court-appointed special prosecutor.  The indictment doesn\\'t include any charges directly related to the original conflict-of-interest allegations that triggered the 10-month investigation, and it doesn\\'t name any business associates or former government officials who joined Mr. Deaver\\'s lucrative lobbying and public relations firm.  In a statement, Mr. Deaver said that \"any inconsistencies between my testimony and the vast array of facts\" assembled by independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. were \"totally inadvertent.\" Asserting that he is \"confident\" of being cleared, Mr. Deaver said, \"I had no reason to lie, because I knew I had done nothing wrong.\"  In a one-paragraph statement describing Mr. Deaver as a \"friend for twenty years,\" Mr. Reagan said yesterday, \"Nancy and I will keep him and his family in our thoughts during these difficult times.\"  According to the indictment, Mr. Deaver failed to tell the grand jury about six separate meetings he attended in late 1984 and early 1985 at which the issue of acid rain was discussed, and failed to disclose that \"he actively supported\" the selection of Drew Lewis as the president\\'s special envoy to seek a compromise with Canada over the controversial issue. As a lobbyist for the Canadian government after leaving the White House, Mr. Deaver later met with Mr. Lewis and \"spoke out\" to recommend a solution to the problem, according to the Justice Department.  The indictment also alleges that Mr. Deaver failed to tell the grand jury that while representing the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., he \"had contacts and conversations with\" Mr. Shultz; Craig Fuller, Vice President George Bush\\'s chief of staff; and Mr. McFarlane relating to efforts to retain certain tax provisions favorable to Puerto Rico.  Smith Barney has been a manager of about $2 billion in Puerto Rican bonds, and has indicated that when it hired Mr. Deaver, one of his main assignments was to retain tax provisions favorable to the commonwealth.  In addition, the indictment alleges that Mr. Deaver falsely told the grand jury, \"I don\\'t recall any government contact I made on behalf of TWA (Trans World Airlines).\"  When the airline hired Mr. Deaver, the indictment said, he \"agreed to contact\" and did contact Secretary Dole \"in connection with TWA\\'s efforts to block or delay the bid by Carl Icahn to gain control of TWA.\" To try to block what eventually was a successful takeover bid, according to the indictment, Mr. Deaver also contacted James Burnley, one of Secretary Dole\\'s top deputies, and Roger Porter, special assistant to the president for policy development.  The two other perjury counts involve testimony by Mr. Deaver in May before a House Energy subcommittee, which, among other things, was investigating his lucrative contract with the South Korean government.  \"At the very time he (Mr. Deaver) was negotiating\" a $475,000-a-year contract to represent South Korea through a group identified as the International Cultural Society of Korea, according to the indictment, he talked with the U.S. ambassador in Seoul and \"personally requested\" that Adm. Poindexter \"assist in arranging\" a meeting between President Reagan and a senior South Korean official visiting Washington. The indictment said Mr. Deaver failed to disclose those contacts.  The grand jury also accused Mr. Deaver of failing to disclose contacts with five other White House or National Security Council officials on behalf of clients. ',\n",

Scott, chairman and chief executive officer, said.  Without acquisitions, Emhart\\'s revenue is likely to grow about 8% a year through 1990, short of Mr. Scott\\'s goal of increasing revenue at a rate of 15%, he said. He suggested the company is interested in buying businesses that would increase annual revenue about $700 million.  Emhart had 1986 revenue of $2.1 billion and a net loss of $10.2 million after a restructuring charge of $90 million.  William C. Lichtenfels, president and chief operating officer, wouldn\\'t identify Emhart\\'s acquisition targets, but said Emhart is \"actively interested in home improvement and recreation opportunities, with emhasis on do-it-yourself segments.\"  Emhart is based in Farmington, Conn. It produces industrial fasteners, glassmaking machinery, shoe materials, hardware, lawnmowers and golf clubs and provides computer services.  Mr. Scott said two of his objectives are to increase earnings per share at a rate of 13% and to keep the company\\'s debt-to-equity ratio at 40% or lower. The ratio currently is at about 41%.  Emhart\\'s revenue in the past six years has grown at about the same rate as the gross national product. \"We don\\'t feel that\\'s sufficient,\" Mr. Scott said in remarks prepared for delivery at a Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. forum here. \"We think it ought to be growing at least twice that in the nearer term -- and somewhat more aggressively in the longer term.\" Mr. Lichtenfels also spoke at the forum.  Mr. Scott estimated Emhart\\'s revenue in 1987 will be about $2.3 billion, of which 62% will come from its customary industrial businesses, 20% from consumer-products businesses and 18% from its information and electronic systems business, primarily Planning Research Corp., which it acquired recently. In 1990, he hopes to draw 43% of the company\\'s revenue from industrial businesses, 28% from consumer products and 29% from information and electronic systems. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0053': ' --- By Ann Monroe Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) </IN> In a challenge to rules barring banks from the securities business, Chase Manhattan Bank introduced a deposit account that ties returns to the stock market. The bank also said it is seeking permission to sell its own mutual funds.  Robert R. Douglass, the bank\\'s vice chairman, portrayed the moves as assaults on Glass-Steagall Act restrictions that generally prevent banks from engaging in securities activities. Offering mutual funds has been considered forbidden by the act.  Some in Congress recently have resisted granting expanded powers to banks. A bill before the Senate includes a moratorium on banks\\' expansion into such areas as underwriting certain municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other assets. Sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), the bill has cleared that panel and is enthusiastically supported by the brokerage industry but is being actively opposed by banks.  Mr. Douglass said he hopes the new account, called a market index investment, will help \"bring about a sense in Congress that Glass-Steagall should be changed,\" adding that \"we aren\\'t going to stop there.\"  Chase Manhattan Corp. is the first bank holding company to seek to offer its own mutual funds, it said. Applications to offer other securities-related products have been filed already by Chase and other banks.  Chase has applied to the Federal Reserve Board for permission to act as sponsor, investment adviser and distributor for various mutual funds to be offered through its investment advisory subsidiary, the company said.  Meanwhile, the new stock market-related account seems to come about as close to a mutual fund as anything a bank currently may offer. Depending on the investor\\'s desired minimum rate of return and maturity, the account currently pays as much as 75% of any percentage increase in the S&amp;P 500 index during the term of the account. If the account had been available a year ago, Mr. Douglass said, investors could have obtained returns as high as 18% during last year\\'s bull market, when the index jumped 24%.  Investors can choose a 4% or 2% guaranteed return, or dispense with the guarantee. At the same time, they can choose among three-month, six-month, nine-month and one-year maturities. The lower the guaranteed return, and the longer the maturity, the greater the percentage of any index increase the investor receives. At current terms, investors could obtain as much as 75% or as little as 25% of any increase. When the account matures, investors receive their principal plus the contracted interest. If the index declines, investors receive any guaranteed interest plus their principal.  The bank plans to adjust the formula tied to the index weekly. The formula is based primarily on Chase\\'s cost of hedging its exposure in the futures market.  Chase will offer the non-negotiable accounts in amounts from $1,000 to $1 million, although they will be insured only as high as $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The bank is also working on a similar account for its corporate and institutional clients. Chase Manhattan Corp.\\'s treasurer, J. Richard Zecher, said Chase had considered also offering the account in reverse, structuring it so investors\\' yields would increase when the stock market dropped, but decided to start with only one version.  The new account doesn\\'t carry any fees or commissions but has stiffer than usual penalties for early withdrawal because of the costs of unwinding the bank\\'s hedges. The account is non-negotiable and will be offered nationwide. ',\n",

For the quarter ended Feb. 1, the chain of home improvement stores expects to post net income of about $7.7 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.6 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier, Mr. Marcus said. The company expects to report that sales rose to $273.9 million from $203.7 million, he added.  Mr. Marcus also said the company expects to report that profit for the full year rose to about $23.9 million, or 90 cents a share, from $8.2 million, or 33 cents a share, in fiscal 1986. Sales rose 44% to $1.01 billion from $700.7 million, he said.  The substantial profit improvements in the latest quarter and year reflect the company\\'s successful program to digest the huge expansion undertaken during fiscal 1986, Mr. Marcus said. Fiscal 1986 profit was depressed after Home Depot increased its number of stores to 50 from 22. The expansion also doubled the company\\'s markets.  Mr. Marcus said the expansion \"was worth the investment.\" In the latest year, however, he said the company slowed its expansion and improved profit by a \"rededication to the business we invented.\" Home Depot opened only 10 stores, he said, while consolidating existing markets, enhancing store merchandising and retraining its sales staff. \"We are now a more effective company than we\\'ve ever been,\" he said.  Mr. Marcus also said he expects the current year to \"be a very good year,\" and that the company plans to open 16 stores this year. There are currently 61 stores in the chain. ',\n",

The biotechnology concern is awaiting approval from state regulators to begin open-air testing of the microbe, which is designed to protect crops from frost damage. As previously reported, the federal Environmental Protection Agency last month reinstated Advanced Genetic\\'s test permit, and approved three possible test sites in California. The company said it expects the field test of the product, which it calls Frostban, to begin this spring.  The EPA originally granted permission for a field test of the microbe in November 1985, but suspended the permit three months later after it was disclosed that the company had violated federal regulations in initial tests of the product. Advanced Genetic eventually paid a $13,000 fine and repeated the earlier experiments.  Brentwood is a suburban and agricultural community about 40 miles east of San Francisco. Advanced Genetic said that, although their approval isn\\'t a requirement for proceeding with the test, county supervisors this week voted in support of the Brentwood site.  Contra Costa County Supervisor Nancy Fahden said the board\\'s unanimous vote came after the county\\'s agricultural community voiced support at public hearings on the matter. The selling point to some supervisors was the idea that \"this process could be a way of reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides\" in the future, she said. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0050': 'Rise in Allowance For Oil Depletion</HL> NATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN> Energy Secretary John Herrington, facing an uphill battle within the Reagan administration, has proposed a substantially more generous depletion allowance for domestic oil and gas producers.  Mr. Herrington, as part of his overall effort to help the beleaguered U.S. petroleum industry, this week asked the cabinet and President Reagan to approve a 27.5% annual depletion allowance for all domestic oil and gas wells, administration officials said.  The letter proposing the tax breaks, which could cost the Treasury $2 billion to $7 billion annually, was sent to the president earlier this week, but hasn\\'t been released. The Washington Post reported the proposal in yesterday\\'s editions.  Appearing before a House Energy subcommittee yesterday, Mr. Herrington acknowledged that the proposal, along with other policy options detailed in a comprehensive report the Energy Department released Tuesday, may be blocked by the White House or the Treasury Department. The general concept of opening up last year\\'s tax-overhaul law for amendments, Mr. Herrington said, hasn\\'t been favored by the administration in the past \"and may still not be favored by the administration.\"  Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said yesterday that President Reagan hadn\\'t yet formed an opinion on Mr. Herrington\\'s depletion-allowance proposal. \"I think (Mr. Reagan) does have a fundamental objection\" to putting back breaks into the overhauled tax code for the oil and gas industry, Mr. Fitzwater said. \"However, we do have these recommendations, and they will be honestly considered and judged.\"  Some industry analysts have estimated that the depletion-allowance proposal could cost the Treasury as much as $7 billion annually, while Energy officials estimated the potential revenue loss at between $2 billion and $3.5 billion annually.  The oil-depletion allowance permitted companies to deduct 27.5% of the value of oil produced from wells until 1975. Major oil companies lost the tax break in that year, and independent producers have seen it whittled to 15% since then. ',\n",

Their net income totaled $17.8 billion last year, down 1.4% from the industry\\'s record $18.1 billion in 1985. FDIC Chairman William Seidman attributed the decline to continuing problems in the agriculture and energy fields.  Data filed with the FDIC also show that nearly 20% of the nation\\'s federally insured commercial banks reported losses last year, up from 17% in 1985. The figures, released yesterday by the FDIC, were taken from reports the institutions are required to give the FDIC.  More than 81% of the unprofitable banks were west of the Mississippi River. One in four of the institutions in that part of the nation had losses, largely because of exceptionally high loan losses. In contrast, only one in 12 institutions east of the Mississippi was unprofitable.  Loan losses were one of the major drags on banks\\' earnings nationwide. Provisions for losses totaled $21.7 billion last year, up more than $4 billion, or 22.7%, from 1985. Nonperforming assets were 1.96% of total assets in 1986, up from 1.87% the year before.  In spite of that, the banks increased their total primary capital 9.2% to a record $208 billion. \"The ones that were performing poorly are doing so poorly, they\\'re dragging the overall aggregate down,\" John Quinn of the FDIC\\'s research division said.  Mr. Seidman, the FDIC chairman, also said \"it\\'s too soon to tell\" what long-term effect Brazil\\'s suspension of its interest payments will have on the U.S. banking industry. \"We don\\'t see now that it\\'s going to have any important effect in the near term,\" Mr. Seidman said.

       " 'WSJ870319-0047': 'To 6 Others in Iran-Contra Investigation --- By David Rogers and John Walcott Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AEROSPACE (ARO) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair voted to grant immunity to six more witnesses and moved to make the U.S. role in the Nicaraguan war the early focus of joint public hearings beginning in May.  The grants of immunity were designed to persuade the individuals -- including several who were prominent in a private Contra supply network -- to testify. The supply network was directed from within the National Security Council during a period in which Congress had prohibited U.S. military aid to the Contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels are known.  Under an agreement reached with Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the affair, the congressional panels also will vote next month to grant limited immunity to John Poindexter, former national security adviser. Investigators could begin interviewing Adm. Poindexter privately a few days before the scheduled start of hearings May 5.  Committee members said the decision to focus the first hearings on the U.S. role in Nicaragua was dictated in part by the chronology of events. But it also has political importance because it will influence how the entire Iran-Contra affair is cast in the months ahead.  The private network assisting the Contras pre-dated any diversion of funds from U.S. weapons sales to Iran, and investigators believe the scandal can only be understood in this context.  Moreover, by securing Adm. Poindexter\\'s early testimony, the committees hope to determine whether President Reagan approved the creation of the private network to aid the Contras and whether he knew about the National Security Council\\'s role in directing it. Adm. Poindexter was head of the NSC, a branch of the White House.  \"The diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales is only a part of the puzzle, and maybe a very small part,\" a congressional source said. \"We first want to focus on how the private network which supplied the Contras got set up in 1984, and whether (President) Reagan authorized it.\"  Intelligence and congressional sources said William Casey, former Central Intelligence Agency director, appears to have been one of the architects of the private aid program. They said Mr. Casey directed some of his subordinates to help Lt. Col. Oliver North, fired NSC aide, supply arms to Iran and aid to the Contras.  Separately, intelligence sources said a report by the CIA\\'s inspector general concluded that officials at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., and at CIA stations in Europe and Central America helped funnel aid to the Contras despite a CIA directive to avoid violating the congressional ban at that time on aid to the insurgents.  The sources said the report doesn\\'t single out any officials or recommend disciplinary action. But the former CIA station chief in Costa Rica already has been given early retirement, following disclosure that he helped coordinate arms deliveries to the Contras.  The congressional committees so far have approved grants of immunity for 10 people. The six approved for immunity yesterday include a former NSC aide, Lt. Col. Robert Earl, and two participants in the private Contra supply network, Robert Owen and retired Air Force Lt. Col. Richard Gadd.  Col. Gadd is a close associate of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord. Apart from his role in the private airlift of supplies to assist the Contras, Col. Gadd controls a series of Virginia companies that have received classified contracts from the government for clandestine operations.  Sources said the committees voted to grant immunity to two of Col. Gadd\\'s past employees, including a retired noncommissioned officer in military special operations. The committees previously granted immunity to retired Air Force Col. Robert Dutton, who was part of the same Contra supply network.  Gen. Secord appears increasingly isolated in the investigation. The Senate panel voted yesterday to initiate civil contempt proceedings against him in an effort to force him to turn over bank records important to the inquiry. The measure must next be taken up by the full Senate, where it is expected to be approved promptly. But the process may be overtaken by events, since investigators hope to obtain much of the same information elsewhere.  Albert Hakim, a business partner of Gen. Secord, is believed to have access to many of the same records. The committees last week voted to grant Mr. Hakim immunity, but Mr. Walsh has since indicated that he objects to that move. The prosecutor\\'s objections legally ensure him only of winning a 20-day delay before immunity is granted, however.  The congressional committees announced their plans after days of private talks with Mr. Walsh. By reaching an agreement with Mr. Walsh on the issue of immunity, the committees avoided a fight with the prosecutor, who wanted a 90-day waiting period before lawmakers granted immunity to Adm. Poindexter and Col. North, the two central figures in the affair.  The committees aren\\'t expected to vote on granting immunity to Adm. Poindexter until around April 21, and his first public testimony won\\'t come before June 15. The panels won\\'t decide when to grant immunity to Col. North before June 4, and any testimony he gives under such a grant won\\'t come before June 15.  To expedite their proceedings further, lawmakers said the two panels largely will meld their staffs.

The market wants to see the U.K. get its fiscal house in order and not go on a big spending spree.\"  In modest trading, June British pound futures closed at 1.5950, up .0070.  \"The sterling was consistently strong,\" said Mr. Gartman. He said he was especially impressed in light of remarks by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that he was \"perfectly content\" with the pound\\'s exchange rate. Mr. Gartman said it seemed that Mr. Lawson would prefer a weaker pound to help the U.K.\\'s export business. But Mr. Lawson\\'s remarks didn\\'t dampen enthusiasm for the pound.  And neither did the news that British banks cut the base lending rate 1/2 point to 10%, which would normally draw a bearish reaction. The pound opened firmer and remained strong all day, the analysts said. And since it was a second-day reaction to news of the British budget, some analysts think the market may be poised for a long-term bullish sentiment toward the pound.  \"The U.K. suddenly looks more attractive,\" said Mr. Sloane.  In other commodity markets yesterday:  ENERGY: Futures prices turned lower, in what one analyst termed a \"pause\" after prices had risen in several consecutive sessions to the highest levels in eight weeks. Fundamentals remain strong for the long-term, he said, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparently holding to its production agreement. But a perception that the market has been \"drastically\" overbought for the short-term caused prices to decline. Product prices were weak, most notably heating oil, and this tended to drag down the whole complex, he said. Crude prices were down slightly and resisted the decline. At one point the April crude price topped $19 a barrel, but couldn\\'t sustain the advance. The market appeared to be consolidating prior to making another run at $19, the analyst said. The American Petroleum Institute figures released late Tuesday showed a decline in petroleum product inventories, but refinery runs were a bit higher and the net effect was neutral, one analyst said.  SUGAR: Futures prices eased after two days of gains. After a steady start, prices declined following news that the European Economic Community had offered 60,500 metric tons of processed beet sugar for sale. The quantity was about as expected, but the subsidy of 44.819 European Currency Units per ton, to be paid to trade houses on whose behalf the EEC was selling the sugar, was higher than expected, analysts said. They said the higher subsidy appeared to be intended to keep trade interests from offering very large quantities of sugar into the Community\\'s intervention fund, as had been threatened. One analyst said that long-recurring reports of Cuba\\'s crop difficulties may have been somewhat exaggerated. \"There\\'s a growing concensus that the crop may not be as bad as some thought,\" said William O\\'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. Estimates of Cuban production recently ranged as low as six million metric tons, compared with 7,350,000 tons last year, Mr. O\\'Neill said. \"Now the talk is more like seven million tons or slightly more, which could change the picture entirely,\" he said. Mr. O\\'Neill said that one indication that Cuba may not be having as much trouble as had been thought was that, contrary to expectations, the nation hadn\\'t become an aggressive buyer on the world market to meet its shipment commitments. One trade source said Cuba\\'s crop, which was hurt by Hurricane Kate two years ago, began recovering at the beginning of this season and may have contributed to a better than expected harvest.  LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Fears of a summer shortage sent pork belly futures prices soaring by the maximum daily limit of $2. Movement of bellies, uncured slabs of bacon, into storage continues to be slight, compared with the year-earlier period. Last week 315,000 pounds of bellies were moved into out-of-town storage, compared with 2.3 million pounds the year before.

       " 'WSJ870319-0038': 'Foreign Firms\\' Stakes in Phone Venture --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Reagan administration officials warned that a Japanese proposal to limit the participation of foreign companies in a proposed new international telecommunications consortium could violate a U.S.-Japanese trade agreement and spur congressional demands for retaliation.  The officials were responding to reports that the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, or MPT, intends to limit foreign participants\\' shares in the consortium to 3% each and Japanese partners to 5% each. The officials said such restrictions could contravene a provision of a 1985 agreement that commits Japan to allow foreign companies to hold as much as a third of the ownership of Japanese-based telecommunications firms.  Such a decision would effectively curtail significant participation by foreign companies in management of the new group.  Two rival consortia are trying to win Japanese government permission to start a new international telephone service for Japan, as part of the government drive to open the country\\'s restricted telecommunications market to greater competition. One group is led by Britain\\'s Cable &amp; Wireless PLC and Japanese trading house C. Itoh & Co.; among its partners is Pacific Telesis Group, San Francisco. The other group is led by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. To win the license, each group has been assembling as broad a coalition as possible within Japanese industry.  The new service would compete with Japan\\'s long-time monopoly supplier, Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., for a share of Japan\\'s $1 billion-a-year market for international telecommunications services.  In London, a Cable &amp; Wireless spokesman said that if Japan should curtail the company\\'s stake, this could prompt a bitter trade row between Britain and Japan. In the past year, top British government officials have been lobbying their Japanese counterparts on behalf of Cable &amp; Wireless, billing the issue as a test of Japan\\'s willingness to trade fairly with the West.  The proposals relating to the consortium were attributed to Fumio Watanabe, a representative of the Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren, which often brokers understandings between the Tokyo government and private industry. But U.S. officials believe the proposals reflect the MPT\\'s own views. The Cable &amp; Wireless spokesman also said that the limitations seem to be a proposal advocated by Mr. Watanabe.  S. Ross Brown, president of Pacific Telesis\\'s international unit, said that \"there is a level (of ownership) below which we would rethink our position\" on participation in the venture. He declined to specify that level.  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter was further angered by the Japanese telecommunications ministry\\'s proposal to force a merger between the two rival consortia seeking to compete with Japan\\'s KDD monopoly, and to deny the new entrant the right to lay its own submarine cable to transmit signals to the U.S. That position also \"runs directly counter\" to the 1985 accord, Mr. Yeutter asserted in a letter to the Japanese ambassador in Washington, Nobuo Matsunaga.  Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), the coauthor of a pending Senate bill that would penalize Japan for infractions such as these, needed little prompting from the administration. \"The Japanese by their actions are doing more to ensure passage of telecommunications reciprocity legislation than anything I could do,\" he said.  The bill that Sen. Danforth authored with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) would compel the U.S. to retaliate against countries that violate agreements in the telecommunications trade; avenues of retaliation include raising tariffs against telecommunications products from the offending country. The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved an earlier version of the bill last year.  Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska) was equally upset over the MPT\\'s intention to reject the consortium\\'s cable-laying project and force the new company to use KDD\\'s lines instead. Sen. Murkowski said the new cable could offer U.S. suppliers a share of the estimated $400 million in installation business. The cable is supposed to link Sen. Murkowski\\'s home state with Japan and the continental U.S.  Mr. Yeutter\\'s letter in effect urged the Japanese Foreign Ministry to dissuade the MPT from using its back-channel influence to undermine existing trade accords. \"This represents a serious threat to the viability of our (agreement), and indeed to the entire negotiated approach to solving our trade problems,\" he wrote Ambassador Matsunaga.

The three concerns were sued last month by Microsoft, which alleged patent infringement and unfair trade. The maker of microcomputer software said the injunction applies to a software program, \"Falcon MS-DOS,\" made by Very Competitive Computer Products Corp. and Evergood Computer International Corp., both of Taiwan.  Microsoft, whose MS/DOS has become a world-wide standard for desk-top computers, said the judge rejected the two companies\\' claims that they had indirectly through third parties obtained licenses for the operating system. Neither company could be reached for comment.  Microsoft said the judge\\'s order also applies to Montebello, Calif.-based Wetex International (USA) Corp., a closely held computer equipment wholesaler which imported the copies into this country.  Robert Fong, an attorney for Wetex, said, \"My client saw licensing agreements which to him indicated that these were authorized goods.\" Mr. Fong said Wetex didn\\'t know before the suit was filed that there were questions about the license for the product. He said Wetex has voluntarily stopped sales.  Microsoft said that, acting with earlier court permission, it had already impounded about 50,000 copies of the software in the past month. ',\n",

On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the West German pharmaceutical and chemical company's share price rose the equivalent of 38 cents yesterday, to $159.52. On Tuesday, Bayer's shares had tumbled $6.80, or 4.1%, to $159.14.  Bayer's rise also pulled up the shares of other West German chemical companies, whose stock had been knocked down Tuesday by news of the AIDS suit. BASF AG's shares rose 28 cents, to $137.92, while Hoechst AG's stock gained 12 cents, to $137.76.  A Bayer spokesman said fewer than 20 patients treated with so-called Factor VIII antihemophilia drugs, which are produced by a U.S. unit of Bayer, have filed liability claims against the group because they said the substance was contaminated by the AIDS virus HIV. The contamination is said to have taken place at a time when the virus couldn't yet be detected.  Bayer didn't deny that its product might have been contaminated in the past. But since early 1985, when a method to detect HIV anti-viruses in the human blood was developed, Bayer said it has been applying all precautions to assure that its drug is free of AIDS. \",\n",

Details are expected to be announced next week by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.  Officials said the acceleration of the government\\'s denationalization program will give it more funds to reinject in the economy.

Treasury bond prices rose slightly early in the day, but the rally quickly faded. The Treasury\\'s latest 30-year bond issue wound up the session with a decline of about 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. Corporate bonds were mostly flat, but municipals posted small gains.  Yesterday the Treasury announced details of a $25 billion financing operation scheduled for next week. The department said it will sell $10 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday, $7.75 billion of four-year notes Wednesday and $7.25 billion of seven-year notes Thursday. Because these amounts were exactly what many traders anticipated, the news had little effect on the credit markets.  Trading volume again was sleepy, and traders said they doubted that the bond market would wake up until a clearer picture of the economy\\'s direction emerges. \"Neutral kinds of numbers give you a neutral market,\" said Walter Wulken, director of investment strategy at Gruntal &amp; Co. \"The market just keeps drifting along.\"  Yesterday, the Commerce Department reduced its estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth to a meager 1.1% annual rate from its original estimate of 1.3%. These figures are adjusted for inflation.  The government\\'s revised fourth-quarter economic report \"failed to stir the credit markets,\" said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. \"This year, the main influence on interest rates is the dollar. Last year, it was the price of oil.\"  Randy M. Strausberg, senior vice president of Nikko Securities Co. International, said he believes the bond market will remain sluggish until there\\'s a significant movement in the currency markets or until the economy makes a decisive move either up or down. Mr. Strausberg and many other analysts said such a move was unlikely for at least the next few weeks.  With the economy apparently growing at a lethargic pace and with inflation remaining moderate, most analysts agree that the Federal Reserve System has no incentive either to tighten or loosen credit conditions any time soon.  Although inflation has remained moderate, many Federal Reserve System officials repeatedly have emphasized their continued concern about the outlook and have indicated that fighting inflation should remain the Fed\\'s top priority. This view was echoed yesterday by Thomas C. Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Mr. Melzer, in a speech in London, said the Fed must resist public pressure to attempt to solve all the nation\\'s short-term economic woes by excessive credit-easing moves. Instead, he urged the Fed to focus primarily on keeping inflation in check, which he said is \"the only goal that monetary policy can accomplish consciously and by design.\"  With the U.S. economy \"awash with liquidity at present, the risk of rekindled inflation appears to be rising,\" Mr. Melzer said at a meeting sponsored by the Centre for Banking and International Finance at the City University of London. A copy of his remarks was released by the St. Louis Fed.  \"Erring on the side of excessive monetary ease in response to short-run pressures will rekindle inflation in the long run,\" Mr. Melzer warned. He said the task of picking guideposts for Fed policy remains extremely complex because the relationships between the nation\\'s money supply measures and both spending and inflation \"have become much more erratic and much less predictable\" since the early 1980s. Focusing on bank reserves or the monetary base, he said, represents an alternative that \"may deserve more recognition than it has received to date.\"  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\\'s index of long-term Treasury bonds gained 0.82 point to close at 1428.15. It hovered between 1426.29 and 1432.17.  The Treasury\\'s 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 edged lower to 99 29/32 from 100 Tuesday, as the yield rose slightly to 7.51% from 7.5%. The government\\'s 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 100 12/32 from 100 14/32, while the yield inched up to 7.19% from 7.18%.  Rates on short-term Treasury bills declined. The rate on the Treasury\\'s latest three-month bill slipped to 5.52% bid from 5.55% Tuesday, while the rate on the Treasury\\'s latest six-month bill fell to 5.48% bid from 5.55%.  The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another on overnight loans of reserves, also fell yesterday. The rate averaged about 5 15/16% after averaging 6.05% Tuesday.

       " 'WSJ870319-0031': 'New Responsibility on Deficit Exacts Heavy Price --- By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) CONGRESS (CNG) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> If the Democrats are to produce a credible budget, says Sen. Lawton Chiles, \"we will have to ask all constituencies . . . to bear sacrifice.\"  That is the conclusion of a confidential memorandum used by the Senate Budget Committee chairman to explain the vexing dilemma he and fellow Democrats face. With majority control of both chambers of Congress, Democrats are now finding that they have a new responsibility for deficit-cutting that carries a heavy price.  \"This is probably a no-win situation all the way around,\" says Richard Moe, a veteran Democratic adviser. \"There is no good news fashioning a budget compromise.\"  Democrats insist they are making tough decisions. In the House, Budget panel members meeting in private sessions are deciding to cut funds for mass transit, foreign aid, space exploration and farm subsidies. In the Senate, a broad-based freeze is the best that most constituencies of domestic spending programs can hope for.  But it isn\\'t clear whether the Democrats can hold it all together. They are, in many ways, at war with themselves over the deficit issue. While cutting in some places, they also are trying to make room to boost some spending programs, such as aid for the homeless, AIDS research, education and job training. There is vast disagreement between conservatives and liberals about how much to pare military spending.  Democrats also are fearful of Republican attack. Under orders from their leaders, they are moving to raise taxes yet still expect to fall short of Gramm-Rudman deficit targets -- two politically treacherous actions given President Reagan\\'s balanced-budget, no-tax rhetoric.  Such a combination, chides Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), \"is like sounding a retreat before the battle has begun.\" A tax increase, in particular, he adds, is \"license for fiscal irresponsibility.\"  At stake for the Democrats is a rare opportunity. In a significant change, polls show that the Democrats are drawing even with Republicans on the question of which party is better at keeping government spending under control. The enactment of a credible deficit-cutting plan that makes real spending cuts could go far toward erasing the Democrats\\' image as big taxers and big spenders. By forceful budget action, the Democrats also could capitalize on the advantage they already have with a president weakened by the Iran-Contra disclosures.  \"Democrats have the credibility\" on the budget issue, asserts Kirk O\\'Donnell, president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. \"Now they have to make the record.\" Failure to come through with a deficit-cutting plan, he adds, would mean \"an opportunity lost.\"  The question of raising taxes is the Democrats\\' biggest hurdle. The party is split over whether it is wise to advocate higher taxes without the backing of President Reagan. Many remember the debacle of the 1984 presidential campaign when former Vice President Walter Mondale supported new taxes and President Reagan rode his anti-tax position to a landslide victory.  Despite misgivings, however, many Democrats seem to believe that times have changed, and that voters accept the need for increased revenues. Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) and the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates say that trying to reduce the massive deficits without taxes is like trying to put out a fire without water. Democrats go to great pains to note that about half the deficit reduction in President Reagan\\'s own budget comprises revenue increases.  There is far less agreement among Democrats about how to deal with military spending. Speaker Wright has called for a $9 billion reduction in military outlays in fiscal 1988, but other Democrats in both chambers are resisting so large a cut. Some warn that any paring of the military budget could open the Democrats to the old criticism that they are weak on defense, lose them voters, particularly in the South, and incite conservative Democrats to ally themselves with Republicans to block a Democratic budget plan.  Reluctance of conservative Democrats to accede to military cuts has compelled liberals to resist cuts in social programs. This tug of war has impeded the ability of Democrats to complete their own budget proposal in the House Budget Committee. \"They are having trouble,\" says House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). \"This is hard business.\"  The squabbling is compounded by President Reagan\\'s unwillingness to compromise. He and congressional Republicans are poised to pounce on the Democrats for proposing to raise taxes, missing Gramm-Rudman\\'s deficit goal of $108 billion in fiscal 1988, or both. The result is an ever-increasing interest by Democratic lawmakers in finding GOP allies for making tough choices and to devise strategems for laying blame on others if they don\\'t find such support.  Today Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee will start public drafting sessions with an eye to educating both Republicans and Democrats about the near-impossibility of hitting the Gramm-Rudman goal without a tax increase and devastating spending cutbacks. Democratic leaders are considering holding out the threat of slashing programs to reach that goal as a way to compel more modest action.  The consequences of failure this year could be harsh. By mid-May, lack of a budget plan could prevent a necessary increase in the federal borrowing limit and precipitate a fiscal crisis. Politically, the Republican White House is required next year to propose a budget that brings the deficit down drastically to $72 billion -- a prospect that should make GOP presidential candidates cringe. Democratic candidates have their own worry -- the final deficit figure for fiscal 1988 will be released just weeks before the November election.  Last year, lawmakers resolved their responsibilities under the Gramm-Rudman law with a deficit-reduction package that everyone agreed was filled with false savings and exacerbated the problem they face this year.  \"It\\'s a problem I feel a great frustration about,\" says Rep. Foley, remarking that the politics of the issue is clearly against a viable deficit-reduction plan. \"It can be mobilized to prevent serious and constructive action in the coming months,\" he says.  Ironically, the Democrats\\' key to success on the budget issue may well be an accommodation by the nation\\'s top Republican, Ronald Reagan.  ---  The Budget Deficit Problem (Fiscal years, in billions of dollars) 1988    1989    1990    1991 Projected deficit            $170.6  $164.4  $136.8  $109.5 Gramm-Rudman deficit target   108.0    72.0    36.0     0.0 Required deficit reduction     62.6    92.4   100.8   109.5 Source: Congressional Budget Office ',\n",

The 62-year-old Mr. Engen, who became FAA chief in April 1984, told President Reagan in a letter that he was looking forward \"to working in the best interests of aviation in the private sector.\" The retired Navy vice admiral noted that his Navy and civilian government service has spanned more than four decades.  Neither the letter nor a prepared statement released by Mr. Engen elaborated on his reasons for leaving the FAA, an arm of the Transportation Department. Some inside and outside the agency, however, suggested that Mr. Engen had become frustrated by the department\\'s aggressive role in a wide range of FAA matters, from budget to personnel to technical issues.  \"He felt he had accomplished about as much as he was going to,\" an FAA official said. \"There is a limit as to what he thinks he could do.\"  Aides said, for example, that Mr. Engen was distressed by administration and congressional reluctance to spend all the money in the aviation trust fund. The fund, comprising ticket taxes and other user fees, is intended for airport expansion and air-traffic control modernization. The Reagan administration and Congress have allowed the surplus to increase -- to $4.3 billion at the close of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 -- because it makes the federal deficit look smaller.  Mr. Engen is credited with toughening the FAA\\'s inspection program and imposing big fines on airlines that violate air-safety rules. Eastern Airlines, for example, recently paid a $9.5 million fine to settle charges involving some 78,000 alleged violations.  The administrator also has worked to rebuild the nation\\'s air-traffic control force, which was in turmoil after the 1981 firing of 11,500 controllers for striking. And he pushed the implementation of the agency\\'s multibillion-dollar computer modernization plan.  Both of these areas, however, remain enmeshed in controversy. Critics, both in Congress and in the aviation industry, contend that the administration hasn\\'t moved fast enough to rebuild the controller work force. And the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, has said the FAA\\'s modernization plan has fallen years behind schedule, leaving the agency understaffed in the interim.  Critics say that in both cases, Mr. Engen wasn\\'t forceful enough in pressing for changes to improve the system. They said Mr. Engen\\'s mild manners and role as a team player may have contributed to continued problems for air transportation.  Recently, in an extended finger-pointing exercise, the agency and the airlines have blamed each other for massive flight delays. Talks to revise airline flight schedules are expected to continue today and may alleviate the problem.  Despite such turbulence, industry officials praised Mr. Engen for his dedication and hard work. \"His emphasis on safety has been oustanding,\" said William Bolger, president of the Air Transport Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents the major airlines. Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, \"He sought to make a positive difference in people\\'s lives, and he has succeeded.\"  Mr. Engen served on the National Transportation Safety Board for two years before going to the FAA.

       " 'WSJ870319-0028': 'Stock Prices Run Into Roadblock, End Session With Small Advance --- By Beatrice E. Garcia</HL> STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN> Stock prices hit heavy technical resistance at the 2300 level on the Dow Jones Industrial Average during yesterday\\'s busy session, then retreated to settle for tiny gains at the closing bell.  The industrial average finished up 2.13 points at 2286.93, its second consecutive record close, but far below intraday highs, when it penetrated 2300 several times.  The 2300 mark \"proved to be quite a brick wall\" for the stock market, said Eugene Peroni, director of technical analysis at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Sellers emerged as the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved above that level.  The broader market averages also struggled to their second consecutive record closes. Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index gained 0.31 to 292.78, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 0.23 to 166.64.  More than 198.1 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared with 177.3 million Tuesday. Despite the new highs in the closely watched market barometers, the advancing issues never had an impressive lead over decliners during the session. By the close, the tally stood at 810 gainers and 767 decliners.  Secondary stocks also advanced. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite rose 0.37 to a record 435.16 as volume expanded to 160.9 million shares from 153.9 million Tuesday. But as on the Big Board, yesterday\\'s advance was narrowly based. Only 1,167 Nasdaq issues advanced, while 1,105 declined. The American Stock Exchange\\'s Market Value index rose 1.80 to 337.04.  Some technical analysts are worried that the Dow Jones Transportation and Utility averages remain far from their record highs, while the industrial average has moved into uncharted territory.  Technicians like to see the three averages moving together to underscore the strength of an advance. Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal &amp; Co., said he remains bullish, however. \"You don\\'t need to see the transport and utilities averages confirm a move by the industrial average on the same day, or even in the same week,\" he said. \"But if this goes on for some weeks, it\\'ll be cause for concern,\" he added.  The utility average yesterday fell 0.63 to 216.49, far below its record of 227.83, set Jan. 22. Meanwhile, the transportation average fell 1.94 to 936.41 as airline stocks had big losses. Its high was set March 6 at 958.21.  UAL fell 1 3/8 to 57, Delta Air Lines fell 1 to 57, AMR lost 1 3/8 to 54 7/8, and NWA slid 5/8 to 67 1/2. Trans World Airlines rose 1/8 to 28 3/8.  William Marcus, a futures trader with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York, explained that with buyers walking away from the stock market when the industrial average failed to hold gains above 2300, and with a midafternoon drop in the bond market, sellers moved into stock-index futures pits in Chicago.  As the price of the futures contracts declined and moved below the price of the S&amp;P 500-stock index, it became worthwhile for some arbitragers to sell stocks and buy some of then-cheaper futures contracts. The sell programs drove the industrial average down more than 15 points in the final hour. But traders said some institutional investors did a little bargain-hunting just before the closing bell.  Oil-related issues were once again among the most active Big Board stocks. Philips Petroleum rose 5/8 to 15 3/8 on volume of more than 4.4 million shares, topping the Big Board\\'s most active list.  Chevron rose 1 1/4 to 56 3/4, Texaco moved up 1/2 to 35 1/2, and Exxon gained 1 to 85 3/8. Du Pont, which owns Conoco, added 2 1/2 to 114 1/4, and USX, Marathon Oil\\'s parent company, rose 1 1/4 to 27 7/8. All five stocks are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Other oil issues also advanced, although crude oil prices eased in futures market trading.  Unlike the oil stocks, many technology issues lost ground yesterday. International Business Machines, Honeywell, Hewlett Packard, Cray Research, Data General and Compaq Computer were among the losers. However, Microsoft, the maker of computer software, jumped 4 1/2 to 89 1/2 in OTC trading. The stock was reportedly recommended by Goldman Sachs.  While the rally might have faltered briefly yesterday, brokerage stocks managed to hold on to much of their early gains. Merrill Lynch rose 1 1/4 to 42 3/4, PaineWebber moved up 1 3/8 to 36 7/8, E.F. Hutton rose 5/8 to 39 7/8, A.G. Edwards gained 3/8 to 35 1/2, and First Boston rose 1 1/4 to 50 1/4. Salomon Inc., after lagging behind for most of the session, ended up 1 1/2 at 41 3/4.  American Express ran up 1 to 78 5/8 on more than 2.9 million shares. Rumors circulated once again through Wall Street that American Express was planning to sell a minority interest in its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit to Nippon Life Insurance of Japan. After the close, sources at American Express confirmed the agreement, but company officials declined to comment.  GenCorp soared 16 to 106 1/2. A partnership affiliated with AFG Industries and Wagner &amp; Brown launched a surprise tender offer for the Akron, Ohio-based tire manufacturer at $100 a share. AFG Industries fell 1 5/8 to 39 5/8. Wagner &amp; Brown is a closely held oil and gas concern.  Harper &amp; Row Publishers slipped 3/4 to 52. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said it made a proposal to acquire Harper &amp; Row for $50 a share in cash.  Reebok fell 1 1/8 to 41 3/4. Two shareholders of Avia Group International have filed a suit to block Reebok\\'s proposed $180 million acquisition of Avia.  Bristol-Myers jumped 4 5/8 to 107 in active trading. The pharmaceutical firm said it plans to seek regulatory approval before the end of the month to test a drug to protect humans from AIDS.  Other drug stocks were mostly higher, but Merck, which rose 5 1/8 Tuesday, fell 1 3/8 to 159.  Analysts noted that the market remains highly sensitive to earnings reports, although one trader said one sign of a strong bull market is that the losses in the stocks that disappoint investors are usually shortlived.  Toys \"R\" Us rose 1 1/4 to 38 3/4. The toy retailer reported that earnings for its fourth quarter ended Feb. 1 rose to 89 cents a share from 68 cents a year earlier.  Measurex rose 3/4 to 23 1/2. The company said earnings for its first quarter ended March 1 rose to 34 cents a share from 27 cents a year earlier, and also boosted its quarterly dividend to six cents a share from 4.5 cents.  In the OTC market, Penwest Ltd. moved up 2 3/4 to 31 1/2 after reporting a jump in its quarterly earnings to 85 cents a share from 24 cents a year ago.  Home Depot gained 1 7/8 to 27 1/8. The company chairman told Dow Jones News Service that it estimates fiscal fourth-quarter profits nearly tripled on a 34% increase in sales.  Rhodes Inc., which estimated net for its fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 dropped to about eight cents a share from 25 cents a year earlier, saw its stock drop 3 1/4 to 20.  Another OTC stock, Philip Crosby Associates, tumbled 2 1/8 to 7 1/8 after the company said its 1986 fourth-quarter results could be below its December estimate of 10 cents to 15 cents a share. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0027': 'Brazil Loans to Nonperforming Basis --- By Jeff Bailey and Peter Truell Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Continental Illinois Corp. said it will place most of its Brazilian loans on a nonperforming, or cash basis -- a move being considered by many other major U.S. banks -- unless there is a surprising turnaround in talks with Brazil during the next two weeks.  The announcement came after Citicorp, Brazil\\'s largest commercial creditor, said last week that it would consider placing most of its Brazilian loans on a cash basis. Last month, Brazil said it was indefinitely suspending interest payments on some $67 billion of foreign bank debt.  Continental\\'s announcement, made at a news conference at its headquarters in Chicago, appears to be the strongest indication to date that at least some big banks likely will classify their Brazilian loan exposure as nonaccruing for the first quarter. Citicorp said last week that it wouldn\\'t consider such a reclassification until after the first quarter. The impact on banks\\' profits would vary widely, depending on the size of their exposure and the strength of earnings from other sources.  Nonperforming loans are typically those 90 days or more delinquent. Those and some other troubled loans, because of doubts about their collectibility, are typically placed on a cash or nonaccrual basis, meaning interest is recorded as income only when it is received. In most cases, federal regulations require banks to put loans on a cash basis 90 days after a missed interest payment.  However, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it is possible that some banks will classify the Brazilian loans as nonaccrual at March 31 while others continue to record them as accruing interest. That would mark a departure from the uniformity with which major U.S. banks and regulators have sought to manage the Latin American debt crisis. Officials have voiced fears recently that if banks begin to treat the loans differently, it could lead to chaos.  \"I don\\'t think we\\'ve seen this before, as far as a major (debtor) country is concerned,\" a regulatory official said. In early 1984, when Argentina was behind on payments, the entire money-center banking community put the loans on a nonaccrual basis for a time.  Other big U.S. banks are considering such a reclassification of their Brazilian loans, although they are reluctant to act any earlier than necessary and want to protect earnings as long as possible.  Continental said that if Brazil\\'s suspension of interest payments continues, it would place about $380 million of medium-term and long-term loans to Brazil on a cash basis. That would increase Continental\\'s nonperforming loan total -- $634 million at Dec. 31 -- by $380 million and reduce first-quarter profit $10 million and full-year profit $35 million, the company said.  Last year\\'s first-quarter profit was $40.1 million, or 14 cents a share. Profit for the year was $165.2 million, or 60 cents a share.  William S. Ogden, chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co., the company\\'s bank subsidiary, said he expects the Brazilian loans to be reclassified March 31 \"unless there is something we can point to that is more hopeful.\" That doesn\\'t appear likely; serious talks with Brazil on debt payments haven\\'t yet begun. Continental\\'s total exposure to Brazil at Dec. 31 was $474 million, relatively small when compared with other major banks.  Should citicorp place its $3.9 billion in medium-term and long-term Brazilian loans on a cash basis, its 1987 profit could be cut as much as $190 million -- almost 20% of 1986 profit. But the impact could be far greater on banks with big Brazilian exposures and weaker profits, such as BankAmerica Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.  It appears that Continental\\'s move follows an internal policy, instituted after its 1984 collapse and rescue by regulators, to place loans on a nonaccrual basis when payment is 60 days past due, rather than 90 days. Brazil won\\'t be 90 days delinquent until after March 31, bankers said.  Mr. Ogden also said at the news conference that Continental has charged off about half of its Peruvian loans, beginning about a year ago. As previously reported, Peru last year placed a cap on the amount of interest payments it was willing to make on its foreign debt. Mr. Ogden wouldn\\'t say how much in Peruvian exposure Continental had, but it is believed that Continental charged off all of its medium-term and long-term Peruvian loans, or about $50 million, and still has about $50 million in short-term loans to borrowers in the country. Continental said that, with the exception of troubled foreign debt, it expects its nonperforming loans to continue declining during 1987. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0026': 'Speculators Are Gambling That Casino Stocks Have Above-Average Odds for More Profit --- By Linda Sandler</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD) CASINOS AND GAMBLING (CNO) REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) </IN> The easy money has already been made in Atlantic City, traders say. But a few speculators are betting on Resorts International, Caesars World and Showboat.  Although they\\'ve wilted recently, shares of many companies with big stakes in Atlantic City are at lofty levels. That\\'s partly because Donald Trump last year showed that gambling concerns had valuable assets that weren\\'t reflected in their stock prices.  Mr. Trump, before gaining control of Resorts International, prompted Holiday and Bally Manufacturing to boost their stocks by restructuring their operations. Martin Sosnoff\\'s bid for Caesars World could have the same result if nobody tops his offer, money managers say.  But many casino stocks now reflect their asset values and profit prospects, analysts say. The group trades at about 16 times expected 1987 earnings, compared with a multiple of 12 or 13 last year, says Steve Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. With gambling revenue growing slowly while wagering facilities multiply, Atlantic City profit could be disappointing for some casinos in 1987 and 1988, analysts add.  Casino buffs think some stocks have above-average odds. Resorts and Showboat are trading far below their asset values. Both are scheduled to open new casinos in 1987 and should lure novelty-seeking gamblers from Bally and other competitors, money managers say. Caesars\\' Las Vegas operation and its 87%-owned Caesars News Jersey attract upscale gamblers and are expected to do well.  Besides their earnings prospects, the stocks are magnets for some rank speculation. Some traders hope Mr. Trump might eventually take Resorts private, buying the outstanding shares at a big premium. Caesars New Jersey shares might also be bought if the parent goes private or is acquired, traders add. Showboat for two years has been 9.8%-owned by Baron Capital, a New York money manager, and is considered a potential restructuring candidate.  Mr. Trump says, \"I have no interest in buying (the rest of) the Resorts stock.\" Caesars won\\'t comment, saying it\\'s still \"looking at the alternatives.\" Ron Baron of Baron Capital says, \"I don\\'t expect to do anything hostile with a company.\"  Resorts is everybody\\'s favorite. Its giant Taj Mahal casino, due to open in late 1987, should boost profit significantly, analysts say. And Mr. Trump\\'s fans think he\\'ll move fast to develop Resorts\\' huge land holdings in Atlantic City.  \"Perhaps,\" says Mr. Trump. \"The land is just being looked at right now.\"  Speculation that Mr. Trump might take Resorts private hinges on a theory that he won\\'t want to share profit from Resorts\\' developments -- and he won\\'t like public disclosure. Developers hate tipping off competitors about details and timing of their plans, says one casino executive. But Mr. Trump says disclosure \"isn\\'t a problem.\"  Mr. Trump has agreed to pay $101 million for 585,000 Resorts Class B shares with 73% of the votes, leaving 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding. At 58 yesterday, the Class A shares traded at about 58% of their asset value, analysts say. But it would cost Resorts $485 million to redeem the Class A shares at $85, a price traders want.  Resorts\\' main concern is to complete its $525 million Taj Mahal, says Andrew Racz, an investment banker at Philips, Appel &amp; Walden. Mr. Trump doesn\\'t want the Class A shares because they have almost no voting power, adds an industry executive.  Mr. Trump controls four Atlantic City casinos, one more than allowed by New Jersey law, including two Resorts\\' operations and two of his own. There\\'s speculation he\\'ll turn Resorts\\' older casino into a luxury hotel or convention center.  Caesars World, at 29 3/8 yesterday, has assets of $30 to $35 a share, analysts estimate. The stock is trading above Mr. Sosnoff\\'s $28-a-share bid but has been weak recently because of fears he might take \"greenmail\" for his 13.6% stake. After rebuffing Mr. Sosnoff, Caesars World sued the investor Tuesday, saying, among other things, that he earlier expressed interest in selling shares to the company at a premium.  \"We believe the lawsuit to be without merit,\" Mr. Sosnoff says through a spokesman. \"I would still like to do a friendly transaction and work with Caesars to maximize values for all shareholders.\"  There are about two million Caesars New Jersey shares in public hands. At 15 7/8 yesterday, they might be bought in at prices \"in the low 20s,\" speculates one holder. But the parent might not care to do that. It already consolidates 87% of the subsidiary\\'s profit and, if it wanted, could get 87% of the cash flow through dividends, accountants say.  Showboat, at 28 1/8 yesterday, is \"the purest play on Atlantic City,\" says Mark Manson of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Most casinos pursue big spenders, but Showboat\\'s Las Vegas site lures \"the kind of people who walk the streets of Atlantic City,\" says one fan.  Its Atlantic City operation, slated to open soon, could more than double operating profit to $3 a share in the year ending June 30, 1988, says Ron Baron of Baron Capital. Showboat\\'s assets are worth $40 a share, he says, and could be worth much more in the future.  But all these stocks are volatile. Some of them might languish if Atlantic City doesn\\'t prosper. Says Mike Esposito of Oppenheimer: \"Digging for gold has got tougher.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0025': \"Sues Bank Board On Investment Rule --- By John E. </HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> A big California savings and loan association challenged the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's power to limit investments by state-chartered thrifts.  The suit, filed by Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., in U.S. District Court here, maintains that the Bank Board's investment rule violates a state's authority to regulate the institutions it charters and exceeds the agency's congressional authority to regulate state-chartered thrifts on a case-by-case basis.  Lincoln asks the court to strike down the regulation, first issued in February 1985.  The Bank Board moved to limit the type and amount of equity investments that federally insured, state-chartered thrifts could make with funds deposited with them. The board argued that the failure of a thrift with such investments costs the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. more money than the failure of an institution without equity investments. The FSLIC, an arm of the Bank Board, insures an S&amp;L's deposits to the extent of $100,000 per depositor.  The original regulation barred a thrift from investing more than 10% of its assets without Bank Board approval. Last month, the Bank Board approved a new rule, to take effect April 16, that bases the limit on a thrift's capital as well as on its assets. The new rule's limitations on Lincoln are even more stringent than the original rule's, according to the suit.  California, which granted Lincoln's charter, doesn't place a specific limit on a thrift's real estate investments but does limit equity investments to 5% of assets.  Lincoln has been an ardent critic of the Bank Board's investment regulation. The S&amp;L has about 20% of its $3.87 billion of assets in direct investments and has been rebuffed by the Bank Board in all its efforts to make new investments.  Lincoln has been disputing with the Bank Board over the rule. In late 1984, as the Bank Board considered the issue, Lincoln sought and received permission from California thrift regulators to make investments exceeding the Bank Board's limit.  Lincoln also has received attention because of its connections with Bank Board member Lee Henkel. The thrift made at least $61.9 million in loans to corporations and partnerships in which Mr. Henkel had an interest as well as a personal loan of more than $250,000 that has been paid. Mr. Henkel put all his business interests in a blind trust and had agreed to recuse himself from Bank Board votes involving thrifts with which he has dealt.  When the Bank Board discussed its investment limits in December, Mr. Henkel proposed a rule that, according to agency officials, could have effectively immunized Lincoln and another thrift from any enforcement actions in disputes with the agency over their investments. The proposal died for lack of a second.  Mr. Henkel has said he believed his proposal addressed an industry-wide problem. He didn't participate when the Bank Board revised the rule last month. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0024': 'Self-Inoculation Sparks Debate --- By Marilyn Chase Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> A report that French scientist Daniel Zagury made himself the first human subject to receive an experimental AIDS vaccine has electrified the scientific community, but left it divided as to whether the action was heroism or folly.  Dr. Zagury, a researcher at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, describes his actions in a letter to the British journal Nature, scheduled for publication today. He is one of dozens of researchers world-wide attempting to develop a vaccine to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  Dr. Zagury injected himself last year. The synthetic vaccine was produced by splicing a protein from the outer surface of the AIDS virus onto the vaccinia virus, a staple vaccine long used to immunize people against smallpox.  Dr. Zagury asserts that he suffered no ill effects, saying in a telephone interview, \"Why, yes, I feel well. Of course!\" More importantly, he says his experiment triggered two types of immune responses in his body: antibodies to neutralize the AIDS virus and a critical cellular immune response thought needed to protect against the varying strains of AIDS.  He says a subsequent test in two African patients confirmed this; the test had the support of the government of Zaire.  But Dr. Zagury\\'s experiment has sparked diverse reactions, including fears for his health and a wish that he had provided more documentation of his earlier vaccine tests on animals.  \"This is a crazy experiment . . . It\\'s like a B-movie,\" says Laurence A. Lasky, a senior scientist at Genentech Inc. who has been testing an AIDS vaccine on animals for more than a year. He says that if Dr. Zagury\\'s vaccine, by some remote chance, ends up infecting the French physician with AIDS, \"He may be a hero now, but a fool later.\"  The small size of the test, Dr. Lasky adds, limits its usefulness. \"You can\\'t put the guy down,\" he says. \"It\\'s brave, but unfortunately, it\\'s meaningless.\" He says that even a synthetic vaccine-believed safer because it contains no natural viral particles-should be extensively tested before a human is inoculated. He also questions whether Dr. Zagury will take his experiment to its logical but perilous conclusion: infecting himself with the live AIDS virus to see if his vaccine works.  Despite such criticisms, Dr. Zagury\\'s action has a wealth of historical precedent behind it. Jonas Salk, creator of the original polio vaccination, twice injected himself before beginning broad human trialsonce in 1942 with influenza vaccine and again in 1952 with polio vaccine.  \"I look upon it as ritual and symbolic,\" says Dr. Salk at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. \"You wouldn\\'t do unto others, that which you wouldn\\'t do unto yourself.\" Though he says he isn\\'t advocating self-experimentation for all scientists, he adds, \"I couldn\\'t have done otherwise. It was a prerequisite for me, a responsible act.\"  Dr. Salk says he doesn\\'t recall feeling any fear as he injected himself and doesn\\'t remember any adverse comments from colleagues. \"I didn\\'t consult anyone, \" he says. \"I don\\'t even remember whether anyone objected.\"  Dr. Zagury dismisses any notion that he is a hero as \"stupidity,\" and cites Dr. Salk\\'s work as justification enough for his own experiment. But times have changed, and most scientific institutions now impose stringent rules on human experimentation.  John Fletcher, an Episcopal minister and chief of bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., says self-experimentation has been \"ubiquitous in science\" for centuries -- with mixed results. He cites the 1885 case of Daniel Carrion, a researcher in Peru who injected himself with \"verruga peruana,\" an exotic ailment characterized by fever, skin eruptions and rheumatic disease. He contracted the disease and died.  On the other hand, Mr. Fletcher notes the \"amazing success\" of Werner Forssman, who pioneered the use of cardiac catheters in surgery by inserting one into his own body, a chilling feat that won him a 1956 Nobel Prize in medicine.  But \"the idea of doing this today is highly questionable,\" Mr. Fletcher adds. He says the National Institutes of Health has a 20-year-old rule that requires a scientist to enroll as a bona fide research subject, with all the review and patient protections normally applied to such tests.  \"The ethics of self-experimentation don\\'t rule it out,\" Mr. Fletcher concludes. \"But they guard against the blindness of people who fall in love with their own ideas, and they protect scientists from injuring or killing themselves in the name of progress.\" ',\n",

The maker of polystyrene-based foam cups, insulation and custom-molded packaging products, said it was prohibited from paying the dividend because of bank covenants that require a certain level of earnings.  For the 11 months ended Dec. 31, Texstyrene posted a net loss of $2.1 million on sales of $139.6 million.

In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Rhodes earned $1.9 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $45.6 million.  The major causes of the expected profit decline were an unfavorable year-end accounting adjustment and softer than expected sales, the furniture retailer said. The softer sales were primarily because poor weather slowed consumer shopping, the company said.  Despite the expected decline in fourth-quarter profit, Rhodes said it expects net for fiscal 1987 to be close to year-earlier net. But per-share earnings will be lower because of an increase in average shares outstanding, the company said.  In fiscal 1986, Rhodes earned $12.4 million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $197.3 million. Last May, Rhodes sold about 1,250,000 shares, increasing shares outstanding to about 8.9 million.

       " 'WSJ870319-0017': 'Selling of the Pan Am Games Goes Right Down to the Wire --- By Ronald Alsop Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN> THE PAN AMERICAN GAMES in Indianapolis this August would seem to be a cinch to sell to consumer-product marketers. As the premier international athletic event of 1987, the games will receive 26 hours of coverage on CBS TV. And with so many Latin American countries participating, the event is expected to be of special interest to Hispanic Americans, one of the fastest-growing consumer groups in the U.S.  But with only five months to go, the organizers of the Pan Am Games are still hustling to attract more sponsors and suppliers, especially reluctant packaged-goods advertisers. Why the last-minute scramble? For one thing, the growing number of sports sponsorship opportunities has intensified the competition for marketers\\' limited funds. Campbell Soup Co., for example, decided to pass on the Pan Am Games and invest in next year\\'s winter Olympics in Calgary. Miller Brewing Co. considered a Pan Am sponsorship too, but opted instead for the U.S. Olympic Festival in North Carolina in July.  The real enemy of the Pan Am Games, though, has been time. The U.S. was selected to host the competition only after Chile, then Ecuador had given up the rights. By the time a staff was hired to publicize the event and network TV rights were negotiated, it was already March 1986. \"We started out with a major challenge because companies make sponsorship decisions way in advance,\" says Sandy Knapp, vice chairman of the organizing committee. \"They need long lead times to develop their merchandising plans.\"  THAT\\'S PRECISELY the concern of Donald R. Dixon II, president of Howard Marlboro Sports &amp; Special Events Consulting in New York. He has been studying the Pan Am Games for such Best Foods brands as Skippy peanut butter and Mazola corn oil, but he complains that the event is overpriced considering how little time remains to capitalize on it. \"You want time to do a lot more than just coupon tie-ins,\" he says.  Given its late start, Ms. Knapp believes the Pan Am organizing committee is making good progress. The group has announced 20 official suppliers and 16 sponsors thus far, including McDonald\\'s, Eastman Kodak, Coca-Cola and such local companies as Marsh Supermarkets. A sponsorship costs $500,000 to $2 million and entitles a company to a variety of benefits, including exclusive use of the Pan Am logo and mascot -- Amigo the parrot -- in ads and promotions.  To entice more packaged-goods advertisers, Glendinning Associates, a marketing consulting firm, is developing a Hispanic coupon mailing to reach three million homes when the games begin in August. Among the participants so far: Lever Brothers and Nestle.  Because this is the first time the Pan Am Games have been held in the U.S. since 1959, marketers aren\\'t sure how much enthusiasm they will generate among Hispanics. There are few Hispanics in Indianapolis, and skeptics don\\'t expect many to travel there from, say, Miami or New York. But Ms. Knapp disagrees. \"Since Indianapolis is within a day\\'s drive of half the U.S. population, we believe some Hispanics will make vacation plans around the games,\" she says. \"Failing that, we have the CBS coverage, and we\\'re in final negotiations with Spanish-language radio and TV networks.\"  --- And Now a Break From the Commercial  As 15-second TV commercials proliferate, advertisers fret that their messages will get lost in the clutter. But next month the Backer &amp; Spielvogel ad agency will experiment with 15s to see if two of them might actually have more punch than a single 30-second spot. What the agency plans to do is run two 15s for Miller Lite beer in the same commercial break but separate them with 30-second ads for totally different products.  First, viewers will see an ad in which former football player Ray Nitschke says he is in his favorite bar and the other people there are his \"kind of crowd.\" Mr. Nitschke is bald and wears glasses, and as the camera pulls back, it reveals a whole room full of bald, bespectacled Miller Lite drinkers. Then commercials for two other products will run, followed by another Miller Lite ad. In this spot, ex-basketball pro Bob Lanier, who has a full head of hair, also declares that he is at his favorite bar with his kind of crowd. But when the camera pulls away, he is with the same bunch of bald guys. \"Whoa,\" he says, \"must be in the wrong commercial.\"  \"We\\'ve been trying to find ways to make more innovative use of this new medium of 15-second commercials,\" says Frank Assumma, management supervisor at Backer &amp; Spielvogel. \"One approach is to have the ads interact.\"  Last year in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, Playboy magazine took a similar tack with pairs of both 15-second and 30-second ads. To tease viewers, the first part of one spot showed a voluptuous woman in a black dress, while an announcer cryptically said, \"Her name is Alexandra, and people are dying to meet her.\" An ad for another product ran next. Then, the woman in black appeared on TV again but standing next to a coffin this time. \"The Merry Mortician,\" the announcer said, \"in the April issue.\"  \"We wanted to get viewers to turn to their husband or wife and ask, \\'What just happened to the TV set?\\'\" says Barry Smith, president of Smith Burke &amp; Azzam Advertising in Baltimore. It apparently worked. According to Mr. Smith, researchers found that 48% more men said they intended to buy Playboy after watching a split commercial as opposed to an ad without any interruption.

       " 'WSJ870319-0016': 'Speed Limit on Most Rural U.S. Roads --- By Laurie McGinley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The House voted 217-206 to allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour on most rural interstate highways.  The vote on the controversial issue followed a 407-17 vote approving a House-Senate conference report that authorized about $88 billion for highway and mass transit programs over the next five years. The speed-limit provision and the highway package now go to the Senate, where both measures could come up for a vote as early as today. If the Senate approves both measures, they\\'ll be combined and sent to President Reagan for his signature.  In the past, the Senate has strongly supported a higher speed limit. But under parliamentary rules in effect for the speed-limit provision, an objection from any senator could stall the measure. In addition, the White House has threatened to veto the highway bill, despite Mr. Reagan\\'s support for giving states the authority to raise the speed limit. Administration officials contend that the legislation\\'s funding for mass transit and special highway programs is excessive.  \"The final version (of the bill) isn\\'t within the dimensions of what the administration has said it would accept,\" said a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.  The battle over the speed limit-provision, which would allow states to raise maximum speeds on about 34,000 miles of the nation\\'s 43,000 miles of rural interstate highways, generally pitted congressmen from urban, Eastern states against lawmakers from rural, Western regions.  Proponents of a higher speed limit said the current 55 mph limit was widely ignored, both by drivers and police charged with enforcing it. Further, they argued that vast differences in the traffic volume, geography and safety hazards of different parts of the country meant that state officials could best decide whether the speed limit could be safely increased.  \"This is the 1980s equivalent of Prohibition,\" asserted Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), one of the main sponsors of the provision to allow a higher speed limit. Agreed Kenneth Gray (D., Ill.): \"It\\'s an antiquated law, and it should be changed.\"  But Public Works Committee Chairman James Howard (D., N.J.), a staunch supporter of the 55 mph speed limit, cited studies suggesting that raising the limit would result in an additional 3,500 highway deaths over the five-year life of the bill. One reason, he said, is that many drivers would exceed the limit by 10 mph -- driving at 75 mph.  Rep. Howard sponsored the 1974 law directing that states set their speed limits at 55 mph -- or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. The original purpose of the law was to conserve fuel during the energy crisis, but supporters say an extremely beneficial byproduct was a decrease in highway deaths.  The National Safety Council, a Chicago-based highway safety group, estimates that the 55 mph limit has saved more than 20,000 lives since 1974. But opponents of the current law insisted that other factors, including a crackdown on drunk driving and state seat-belt laws, contributed to a reduction in highway fatalities.  The Senate-passed highway bill included an amendment by Sen. Steven Symms (R., Idaho), to permit states to raise the speed limit on interstate highways outside urban areas with at least 50,000 people, or on about three-quarters of the nation\\'s interstate highways.  But the House-passed measure didn\\'t change the current law, leading to a confrontation in the House-Senate highway conference. Finally, Rep. Howard agreed to a House vote on the Symms amendment. If it passed, he said, it would be incorporated into the overall legislation sent to the Senate.  House Republicans voted 125-50 in favor of allowing states to set a higher speed limit. Democrats voted 156-92 against the measure.  Much of the administration\\'s opposition to the highway legislation centers on more than 100 special projects included in the bill. The legislation would provide as much as $890 million in new federal funds for the projects, and those funds wouldn\\'t be subject to the bill\\'s spending limit.  Overall, the conference report provides about $70 billion for highways and about $18 billion for transit programs over five years. The legislation is a compromise between the House\\'s $91 billion five-year bill and the Senate\\'s $65.4 billion four-year bill. ',\n",

Sesit Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> American Express Co. agreed to sell a minority stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit to Nippon Life Insurance Co. in Japan, sources at American Express said.  The sources, who declined to be identified, confirmed reports of the sale agreement that appeared in the Japanese press. The reports cited Japanese government sources.  Word spread through securities markets yesterday that the Japanese press had reported that Nippon Life -- by far Japan\\'s largest life insurer -- would buy an approximate 10% stake in Shearson for a capital infusion of $600 million. News of the press reports sent American Express common stock up more than $2 in early afternoon trading. American Express shares closed at $78.625, up $1, on very heavy volume, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  American Express sources said the figures reported in the Japanese accounts weren\\'t correct, but declined to provide further details of what one source called a \"complex\" transaction.  As previously reported, American Express has been considering various ways of increasing the capital of Shearson, one of the largest securities firms in the U.S.  An American Express source said an alliance with Nippon Life also would give the securities firm entry into the increasingly important Tokyo securities market. American Express sources stressed that the agreement doesn\\'t preclude a public offering of a Shearson stake. One source, specifically referring to such an offering, said, \"There\\'s more to come.\"  Spokesmen for American Express and Shearson declined to comment.  Shearson isn\\'t the first U.S. securities firm that has gone looking for a Japanese partner. Last year, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. sold a 12.5% stake in its profit to Sumitomo Bank Ltd. of Japan for a capital infusion of $500 million. Also last year, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. considered a link with a Japanese firm before agreeing to sell an 80% stake to General Electric Co., and E.F. Hutton Group Inc. added to its board an executive of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. of Japan, which isn\\'t related to Sumitomo Bank.  The Japanese press reports said Nippon Life has \"no intention of participating in the management of Shearson Lehman at present.\" The reports also said American Express and Nippon are \"expected to cooperate in a wide range of business from credit cards to life insurance underwriting.\"  In Tokyo, a spokesman for Nippon Life declined to comment.  Shearson has been one of Wall Street\\'s most profitable securities firms. In 1986, Shearson supplied $316.1 million, or 25%, of American Express\\'s net income of $1.25 billion. Shearson\\'s book value at year\\'s end was $1.5 billion.  As for Nippon Life, the company had the equivalent of $82.98 billion in assets at March 31, 1986, the end of its fiscal year. That was more than 23% of the total assets of the Japanese life insurance industry and 51% more than second-ranked Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co.  The company is a huge investor in U.S. government securities, stocks and bonds. Nippon Life annually invests between $1 billion and $2 billion in foreign bonds. Analysts estimate that the overwhelming portion of that investment is in the U.S.  A U.S. investment banker noted that a stake in a major U.S. securities firm such as Shearson Lehman would also allow Nippon Life to place orders in the U.S. market and effectively reduce commissions.  Moreover, Japanese investors are accelerating their purchases of U.S. equities. To date, that buying almost exclusively has been concentrated in well-known, blue-chip corporations such as International Business Machines Corp., GE and General Motors Corp.  Nippon Life currently has small stakes in the four largest Japanese securities firms. It owns 2.8% interests in Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co., 2.1% of Nomura Securities Co. and 2% of Nikko Securities Co., according to Japanese bankers.  A Japanese government official stressed that these holdings were purely for portfolio investment purposes.  Like many U.S. and foreign firms, Shearson has a full branch office in Tokyo. It isn\\'t, however, one of the four U.S. members of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which are Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Citicorp\\'s Vickers da Costa.  --- American Express Debt NEW YORK -- American Express Co. said it agreed to convert $100 million of Mexican debt into equity in joint ventures to construct hotels in that country.  The travel-related and financial services company said the agreement covers construction of 3,000 hotel rooms in Cancun, Huatulco, Acapulco and Los Cabos, all major tourist areas. Some of the projects are already under construction, the company said.  Partners in the joint ventures include the Mexican government and Mexican banks and corporations, a spokesman said. Hotel operators in the ventures include Club Med Inc. and Sheraton Corp., a unit of ITT Corp.  The debt represents about 16% of $632 million in debt owed by the government of Mexico to the company\\'s American Express Bank Ltd. unit at year-end 1986, a spokesman said. The debt isn\\'t in arrears, he said. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0002': 'Agree to Merger For $1.3 Billion --- Combination, via Exchange Of Stock, Is the Largest Among Banking Firms --- By Linda Watkins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> Fleet Financial Group and Norstar Bancorp agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at about $1.3 billion, the largest banking combination ever.  The merger is the latest in a series of combinations of regional banks in New England. By combining into so-called super-regionals, the banks are hoping to preserve their independence when nationwide interstate banking eventually is allowed and large money-center banks are permitted to invade their turf.  The combined company, which will be named Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, will have assets of about $23 billion and be ranked among the top 25 bank holding companies in the U.S. Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar are among the nation\\'s top 50 banking companies.  Under the agreement, Norstar stockholders will receive 1.2 Fleet common shares, after a previously announced 2-for-1 stock split by Fleet, for each Norstar share. Norstar currently has about 35 million common shares outstanding. Fleet has 25 million common shares outstanding. Fleet\\'s holders will own about 55% of the combined company\\'s shares outstanding after the merger. The companies said the merger will result in \"minimal dilution\" of per-share earnings.  The companies expect to complete the merger around July 1, 1988, when Rhode Island will remove barriers to interstate banking outside of New England. New York state already allows transactions between banking companies in other states with similar laws. The merger requires regulatory clearance and approval by both companies\\' holders, who are expected to vote on the proposal sometime this spring.  In addition, Fleet and Norstar granted each other an option to buy authorized, but unissued, shares representing 24.99% of each other\\'s fully diluted common outstanding, apparently in a move to discourage any potential buyers.  Although both companies said that the transaction is a \"merger of equals,\" analysts said that Fleet appears to be acquiring Norstar. Thomas Brown, a bank analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said: \"There\\'s a dominant bank ending up with this and the dominant bank is Fleet. It will have more shares.\"  J. Terrence Murray, Fleet\\'s chairman and president, said his company and Norstar are \"a good fit\" and will strengthen one another. \"Norstar has very substantial core deposits which we lack,\" he said. \"We are very strong in non-banking areas such as mortgage banking and consumer finance. They have a presence there but not to the extent we do.\"  Peter D. Kiernan, Norstar\\'s chairman and president, added: \"Their operations tend to respond well to lower interest rates. Our banks . . . respond best to higher interest rates. When one is down a little, the other will be stronger.\"  Under the agreement, Mr. Kiernan will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company until he retires Jan. 1, 1989. Mr. Murray will become president and chief operating officer of the company, as well as chairman and chief executive designate, succeeding Mr. Kiernan upon his retirement.  The merger\\'s value would exceed the value of Security Pacific Corp.\\'s recent agreement to acquire Rainier Bancorp. for $1.1 billion in stock, and Chemical New York Corp.\\'s plan to acquire Texas Commerce Bancshares for $1.19 billion, with the final price contingent on Texas Commerce\\'s future earnings.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fleet\\'s shares rose 12.5 cents to $59.50, while Norstar\\'s stock fell 50 cents to $33.50.  Mr. Murray said Fleet and Norstar have informally discussed merging for more than a year. \"But we have been more serious in the past six weeks or so,\" he said. The merger is part of Fleet\\'s strategy to expand its banking franchise in the Northeast. Fleet currently operates banks in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maine, has banking operations in Massachusetts and runs non-banking subsidiaries in 39 states. Norstar has seven member banks and 12 financial-services companies with offices throughout New York and Maine.  Last year, Fleet tried to acquire Conifer Group Inc. in a stock swap with an indicated value of about $554 million, but was rebuffed when Conifer accepted a higher offer from Bank of New England Corp. The Fleet/Norstar merger will make the combined company the third-largest bank holding company in New England, following Bank of Boston Corp., with assets of $34 billion at year\\'s end, and Bank of New England, which will have assets of about $27 billion after the Conifer acquisition is completed.  Mr. Kiernan said the Fleet/Norstar combination falls in line with his personal goal of assembling a $40 billion-asset group of independent-minded Northeastern banks, a \"super holding company,\" before he retires. Still, he wouldn\\'t say whether Fleet/Norstar will try to acquire other banks in their regions immediately or in the future.  James McDermott Jr., director of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, expects Fleet/Norstar to be acquisition-minded. \"I think their program is ongoing and they will look at other markets to expand into,\" he said, \"possibly New Jersey because it\\'s an economically vibrant state with a good number of solid banking companies.\"  In 1986, Fleet had net income of $136.7 million, or $5 a fully diluted share, and assets of $11.7 billion at year\\'s end. Norstar earned $105 million, or $2.85 a fully diluted share, last year; its assets totaled $11.1 billion at year\\'s end. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870319-0001': 'Yeutter Warns House Panel\\'s Chairman --- By Monica Langley and Eduardo Lachica Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) COMPUTERS (EDP) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) EXECUTIVE (EXE) CONGRESS (CNG) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN> U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski that the Reagan administration still has major objections to the trade bill now moving through the panel.  In a stern letter delivered yesterday to Rep. Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) and trade subcommittee chairman Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.), Mr. Yeutter specified several provisions the administration opposed. He implied that lawmakers must change the bill in order to avoid a presidential veto.  The letter came as something of a surprise, since Mr. Yeutter initially had reacted with \"cautious optimism\" to Rep. Rostenkowski\\'s recent efforts to produce a moderate, compromise trade bill. Lawmakers said the trade representative\\'s change to a hard-line tone suggests that the administration itself is divided over the legislation.  Among the provisions Mr. Yeutter criticized was one substantially expanding federal efforts to provide retraining for workers displaced by imports. The president has proposed some increased worker retraining, but his proposals wouldn\\'t be as extensive or automatic as those that would be provided by the committee bill.  The trade representative also objected to a provision in the Rostenkowski bill that would make violations in foreign countries of workers\\' rights -- such as freedom to associate -- an unfair trade practice and could provoke U.S. trade retaliation.  Mr. Yeutter also criticized several provisions that would limit the president\\'s flexibility in dealing with trade problems. While Rep. Rostenkowski had proposed giving the president much more discretion than earlier House versions of the trade bill, Mr. Yeutter attacked remaining provisions requiring the president to retaliate against certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries.  The trade representative warned that if those provisions aren\\'t eliminated or substantially changed, \"I would find it exceedingly difficult to recommend that the president sign any trade bill including them,\" Mr. Yeutter stated in the letter.  Even congressional Republicans were disturbed by the tone of the trade representative\\'s letter. \"We think Rostenkowski has made a heroic effort at a bipartisan bill, but apparently some in the White House don\\'t want even a bipartisan bill,\" said one Republican. \"The administration isn\\'t at all unified on trade legislation.\"  Mr. Yeutter laid out five tests by which the administration was judging whether to support the various trade proposals. They include looking at whether a proposal \"improves American competitiveness\" and whether it would likely \"provoke retaliation against U.S. exports.\" He also suggested that the administration would object to a provision if \"enactment of mirror legislation abroad (would) be harmful to U.S. exports.\"  The trade representative criticized a provision requiring U.S. trade negotiations, or retaliation, against countries with huge trade surpluses with the U.S. -- even though Rep. Rostenkowski watered down the provision substantially from the original version proposed by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.).  \"Our fundamental objection is that the proposals still contemplate a balancing of bilateral trade through trade policy actions rather than addressing the problem of large external balances through macroeconomic policies,\" Mr. Yeutter wrote.  Meanwhile, Congress and the Reagan administration appeared to be moving in tandem to ease restrictions on the export of high-technology goods with potential military applications. The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee approved such a bill, and the White House submitted a similar, though more modest, proposal.  Lawmakers anticipated that differences between the various proposals can be reconciled. The provisions ultimately will be incorporated in the trade legislation moving through the Ways and Means panel.  Rep. Don Bonker (D. Wash.), chairman of the subcommittee on international economic policy, said there is \"strong bipartisan support\" for the high-technology trade package, which was designed to meet numerous complaints from U.S. companies. The bill \"reflects new realism and political momentum in the House towards a more rational export-control regime,\" he added.  Among other provisions, the bill would eliminate, with only a few exceptions, licensing requirements for those so-called dual-use technology products bound for European allies and Japan. It also would allow world-wide export -- including to the Soviet bloc -- of many kinds of commonly available personal computers and electronics goods.  Another provision would do away with requirements that foreign companies obtain permits before they export to third countries products containing U.S.-made parts -- provided those parts don\\'t exceed 35% of the value of the final products.  The subcommittee\\'s bill also reduces the authority of the Pentagon to block export licenses for exports to the non-Communist world, and it would authorize industry representation in international export-control negotiations. Those provisions are likely to spark protests from Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. But the Pentagon has been gradually losing ground in bureaucratic disputes over who should regulate this sensitive trade.  The House bill reaffirms the intent of earlier legislation to make the Commerce Department the primary regulator for dual-use exports.  Elimination of licensing for most of the high-technology trade with allied countries would speed up paperwork required for such exports, which account for more than half of the U.S. high-technology trade. The bill would require licensing only if the purchaser of such U.S. goods is of a \"suspicious\" character, if the country receiving the goods has a record of noncompliance with U.S. export regulations, or if the products are \"extraordinarily sophisticated.\" ',\n",

Schmedel</HL> REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> ESTIMATED-TAX PAYERS may get a breather before new rules take effect.  The tax act makes quarterly estimated taxes stricter and trickier to figure, but delays in revising the W-4 withholding form and in clarifying rules for corporate tax have complicated first-quarter estimates. Now both the IRS and House Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) are working on interim relief. The IRS says it soon will issue \"safe-harbor\" guidance for large corporations, particularly those with first payments due April 15; second-quarter payments also may be covered.  Rostenkowski and Rep. Duncan (R., Tenn.) have entered a bill to help individuals and corporations. It would delay for a year the rise to 90% from 80% in the share of current liability that individuals must estimate and pay; it would waive penalties for those who file new W-4s by June 1 and try in good faith to comply. It would simplify corporate rules and let large concerns base estimated payments due by June 15 on their 1986 taxes.  The bill also would apply to estimated payments of the broad new \"Superfund\" tax on corporations that is to finance toxic-waste cleanups.  EMPLOYEE LEASING draws the critical eye of the IRS in a compliance study.  Employee-leasing concerns supply full-time workers to relieve companies of hiring, payroll, and other chores and to let them exclude the employees from pension plans; the suppliers have their own benefit plans. But the IRS sees a potential for \"large-scale . . . abuse\" of withholding-tax rules, for undeposited taxes can mount rapidly and delinquent employee lessors have few assets to levy on. So it is doing a study to see how well it handles such cases.  By March 2, collection agents were to gather information from every identifiable employee lessor in the Laguna Niguel, Calif.; Dallas, and Hartford districts. The agents were to compile company descriptions and uncover and deal with any problems regarding deposits of taxes withheld from leased employees. The data are to be sent to the national office by April 1.  MARKED FOR LIFE are homeowners who claim the tax-free profit on sales.  An owner 55 or older may take an exempt gain of up to $125,000 ($62,500 if married, filing separately) on selling a home without buying another. But that election is available only once in a lifetime and not at all if one\\'s spouse used it previously. Thus, the IRS notes, it must \"track these elections until the taxpayer\\'s death\" and \"for the lifetime of both spouses\" after a joint-return election. It says it has a computerized system to do just that.  The IRS National Computer Center keeps a central file to monitor taxpayers who claim tax-free gains. Annually in late October, it sends reports of duplicate, questionable, and excessive claims to the 10 IRS service centers. The centers try to clear up errors and questions but may forward more difficult cases to auditors.  If exemption is denied, but the seller has put the gain into another home within the required time, or plans to, any tax is deferred, of course.  OVERSEAS AMERICANS who neglected to file required U.S. returns for 1985 have only until April 15 to claim a 1985 exemption for foreign earned income, notes Arthur Young &amp; Co., CPAs. It is too late to make initial claims for exemption on late returns for earlier years.  SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS will be cross-checked for unreported income in a pilot project using third-party reports, IRS chief Gibbs told a House hearing; hidden income of small corporations will be studied. But he said report-matching is much harder with businesses than with individuals.  HAVE YOUR COMPUTER call my computer: Electronic filing is hot in the seven areas where preparers file computer-ready returns by wire to claim refunds. About 55,000 such returns have been filed, up from 25,000 in all of 1986; 6,000 filers had refunds deposited directly in bank accounts.  DOES CHARITY TRESPASS on business\\'s territory, or vice versa, or both?  Competition between exempt groups and taxable businesses is increasingly controversial and will be scrutinized by Congress this year. Now a report by Congress\\'s General Accounting Office shows how little is known about its extent and effects. Nonprofits produced $131 billion of 1985\\'s gross national product, but no one has solid data on their business-type ventures. The IRS lists over 800,000 charities engaged in over 260 different activities; by another estimate, there are 1.2 million charities.  To offset drops in government funding and donations, charities rely more on fees and commercial activities. A GAO survey found that 84% of research businesses and 90% of racket-sports businesses say exempt universities and fitness groups compete with them and have unfair advantages. But exempt groups say the activities are related to their exempt aims and note that business has entered such customarily nonprofit fields as health and child care.  Better information is needed to identify the problems and design solutions, the GAO says.  BRIEFS: U.S. district and appeals judges are U.S. officers, not employees covered by an employee retirement plan, the Tax Court held; thus, they may deduct payments to individual retirement accounts. . . .

One friend has gone to Australia, another to Paris. One colleague has hanged himself, another has been arrested. The only person in their homeland who\\'s reachable by telephone is the man they suspect of being an informer.  As written by Janusz Glowacki, directed by Arthur Penn and acted by Dianne Wiest and Ron Silver, the scene plays almost like a George Burns-Gracie Allen routine. The idea of the phone call is lofted like a ping-pong ball; it\\'s then swatted back and forth, getting more and more battered every time. Finally, it\\'s too bruised even to roll, never mind fly.

And Mr. Glowacki cleverly dramatizes their plight by having the real-life nightmares that plague them jump up from beneath the bed: an American immigration officer whose routine but absurd questions set off waves of self-doubt (\"Is cramps a venereal disease?\"); a pair of Polish secret policemen whose matter-of-fact thuggery is laced with sage advice (\"A smart man never writes; a smart man never leaves traces.\"); a couple of well-meaning but dense philanthropist types who offer blankets and condescension (\"They\\'re such interesting people!\").  Perhaps the most telling encounter comes near the end of the second act, when Yannick\\'s Polish censor appears and offers a deal. \"You\\'ll never write anything in the States,\" he warns. And, he adds, \"We believe a short stay on the Lower East Side is a priceless experience for our free thinkers.\" Yannick, who has indeed been unable to write since his arrival, and whose stay on the Lower East Side has indeed been less than delightful, is not tempted. \"I got a memory,\" he says.  Caught between their memories of an impossible past and their fears of an impossible future, Mr. Glowacki\\'s emigres would engage us even if he hadn\\'t bothered to make them so charmingly eccentric. As it happens, Enka is a slave to her histrionic abilities and Yannick an inveterate con artist. She walks around in her nightgown reciting Lady Macbeth\\'s sleepwalking speech; he learns that the handicapped can\\'t be evicted for nonpayment of rent and scrounges up a wheelchair.  Relishing every rolled \"r\" and reveling in each mispronounced syllable, Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver give delicious performances. Mr. Glowacki\\'s characters, rendered into colloquially uncolloquial English by his translator, Jadwiga Kosicka, don\\'t know they\\'re funny. And it takes a very subtle brand of comic acting to convey both their humor and their lack of it. Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver both rise admirably to the challenge. The supporting cast has some lapses, but, luckily, Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver don\\'t need too much support here.  There are also some lapses in the writing. The first act could probably be trimmed a bit with no great loss. And on the night I saw the production, the all-important light fixture that goes on and off as the characters try and then stop trying to go to sleep was not quite in synch with the actors.  But this is one of the delights of a fairly dismal theatrical year. And Mr. Glowacki, who found himself stranded in the West when martial law was declared in Poland, has clearly beaten the cockroaches -- and maybe some of his demons as well. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0170': 'Bookshelf: Sam Donaldson\\'s Own Story --- By Larry Speakes</HL> Sam is Sam.  Ol\\' \"Shoot From the Lip,\" we call him.  Sam is irascible, irreverent, impertinent, and he is a good reporter.  He\\'s also written a good book, \"Hold On, Mr. President!\" (Random House, 260 pages, $17.95). It\\'s good, not great. It takes the reader on an irreverent roller-coaster ride with Sam Donaldson and the two presidents he\\'s covered as White House correspondent for ABC News -- Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan -- but it offers only a peekaboo view of an important time in the nation\\'s history.  \"I\\'ve tried to explain why I cover the White House beat the way I do and why I ask the questions I do,\" Sam writes. And being the reporter he is, he dwells mostly on presidential mistakes, not accomplishments. He learned early in his career that \"you have to speak early and aggressively.\" To someone who daily braved the withering fire of Sam\\'s verbal barrage as I did, this is clearly the understatement of the century.  \"Hold On, Mr. President!\" is the story of Sam\\'s rise from a humble farm boy to one of the most controversial reporters in television. We learn that this aggressive \"Eastern Establishment Reporter\" was reared by a widowed mother in rural New Mexico, educated at a rigid military prep school, aspired to write for right-wing Texas millionaire H.L. Hunt, and voted for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. His farm-boy upbringing also provided an early clue to what was to follow. When, at the age of seven, he blew up the family truck by dropping a match down the gas tank, we should have known he\\'d grow up to make his living hurling verbal firebombs at presidents.  After a false start or two in Texas, he headed for the big time -- New York and the networks. But the big boys weren\\'t interested in a small-town radio announcer with little experience, and he found himself playing a 17th-century gambler in a made-for-TV drama, the only nonspeaking role of his career. The wolf was howling loudly at his door when a part-time reporting job at WTOP in Washington surfaced. So, look out politicians, here comes a reporter destined to make your life miserable.  Almost as soon as he moved on to the network in 1967, Sam developed the habit of being first with major stories. Bobby Kennedy revealed to Sam that he was reconsidering his refusal to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. Sam was the first to pick up the scent of Watergate\\'s Saturday Night Massacre -- first to get the story, he says, but last to report it because of ABC\\'s lack of zeal in putting news on the air.  Sam covered presidential campaigns from Goldwater to Reagan and big news stories from Vietnam to Watergate before taking on the White House. He arrived there in 1977, with President Carter.  He tells of his admiration for Mr. Carter\\'s mother, the venerable Miss Lillian, who came to the ABC News trailer under the water tank at Plains, Georgia, to have Sam serve up a shot glass of Jack Daniel\\'s straight. He attends Miss Lillian\\'s funeral, and, as he views her in the casket, a rare thing happens: Sam is speechless. He recovers sufficiently to say only to the grieving Carter family, \"That\\'s her, all right.\"  Sam was otherwise so vexing to the Carter folks that Press Secretary Jody Powell remarked: \"It\\'s not the fact that you trash us so much that I mind. What I mind is seeing you get such a kick out of it.\"  Yet Mr. Carter fares better than Mr. Reagan. Sam reserves most of his ridicule for my former boss and those of us around him. It may be the fact that Mr. Reagan served longer that provides Sam with more ammunition, or perhaps we had chronic foot-in-mouth disease. I suspect the latter.  Some of Sam\\'s commentary is downright rough. He characterizes Mr. Reagan as one \"who can turn on a big \\'aw, shucks\\' smile, incline his head in that self-deprecating fashion, and charm the pants off a lady wrestler.\" He then adds: \"If you told him you were down on your luck and needed some help, he would literally give you the shirt off his back. But there is another side to the man that is cold and calculating. While you are gratefully putting on his shirt, he will sit down at his desk in his undershirt and happily sign legislation that would take your elderly parents off social security, throw your worthless relatives off welfare and remove your children from the school lunch program -- all in the name of his political ideology.\"  I would be ducking discussion of my biggest tiff with Sam if I didn\\'t say a word or two about his account of my handling of the president\\'s skin-cancer episode. After Reagan\\'s Bethesda Naval Hospital checkup, we handed out a press release skirting the fact that a biopsy was being performed on a patch of skin removed from the president\\'s nose. In the release, I significantly omitted the usual \"Statement by the Principal Deputy Press Secretary\" -- namely, one Larry Speakes. That was a signal that I wasn\\'t prepared to have my name on the statement, which stated only that the tissue \"had been submitted for routine studies for infection.\"  The statement was true, but not the whole truth. Nancy Reagan is a very private person when it comes to her husband\\'s medical condition. Sam, who had been out of town that day, roared back into the briefing room questioning my credibility -- a \"hanging offense,\" in my eyes. Having been absent when the story broke, Sam was oblivious to my agonizing afternoon of behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Reagans and the doctors. He gave me no credit for walking the tightrope. He chose to unleash a verbal broadside publicly in the press room on an issue that more appropriately could have been settled quickly, quietly and in private. Although my credibility was the object of Sam\\'s public scorn, I\\'ll always believe his real target was Mrs. Reagan.  Sam held the presses for this book long enough to include the current Iran-contra crisis. He singles out Rear Adm. John Poindexter, who later resigned as national security adviser, for misleading me as press spokesman -- not only on the Iran arms sales, but for Mr. Poindexter\\'s bum steer on press inquiries about a pending invasion of the island of Grenada by U.S. forces. Mr. Poindexter said \"preposterous\" late one afternoon; the next morning, troops went ashore. On both of these accounts, Sam is right.  --- Mr. Speakes is a senior vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0169': ' --- By Tim Carrington Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The U.S. Navy sees a sticky predicament looming on its horizon: plenty of ships, but not enough sailors to run them.  Congress has agreed to increase the Navy\\'s fleet to 600 ships by the end of 1989, from 558 now. But for the five fiscal years through 1987, lawmakers chopped the service\\'s personnel request by 31,000. As a result, says an aide to Rep. Beverly Byron (D., Md.), the chairman of a House armed services subcommittee, \"these new carriers may end up being gigantic shuffleboard platforms for retired officers.\"  The worry points up a political fact of life: It is easier to win support for big shipbuilding programs than for more sailors and officers. \"It\\'s one thing for Congress to approve the expenditure of money that results in jobs in key sectors, and it\\'s another thing to talk about money for more people,\" says Vice Adm. Dudley Carlson, the chief of naval personnel. If the trend isn\\'t reversed, \"there\\'ll be a shortage of sailors in the 1990s,\" he says, complaining that Congress seemed \"to give us the ships and not the personnel.\"  Personnel has become even more of a target now that Congress is scraping for spending cuts to meet the deficit-reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman budget law. While money authorized for ships is spent over six or seven years, funds for people are spent immediately. Thus, cuts in personnel ease the most pressing demands for spending reductions.  With dozens of new ships entering the fleet in the next several years, the Navy is pushing Congress to increase the number of active-duty personnel to 605,000 in 1989 and 617,300 in 1991 from the current 587,000. But winning this expansion will be a challenge for Navy Secretary-designate James Webb. He will succeed John Lehman, who lobbied hard for the 600-ship fleet.  Some in Congress aren\\'t eager to support further Navy expansion. Rep. William Dickinson (R., Ala.), ranking minority member of the House Armed Services Committee, recently charged that the Pentagon budget \"shafts the Army\" partly by seeking big increases for the Navy.  There is even talk in Congress of slowing the construction of new ships until sufficient personnel have been recruited and trained. The Navy staunchly opposes this approach.  Keeping the ships steaming with fewer people, however, could soon push the Navy into what career officers call the \"deathspiral.\" It works this way: Experienced seamen must spend longer rotations at sea, worsening the problems of family separations and low morale. Inexperienced seamen are given technically complex tasks aboard ships, and costly equipment is broken or poorly maintained.  Finally, says a commanding officer who endured a severe personnel shortage in the late 1970s, \"officers are overworked and unhappy and they leave.\" This exacerbates the personnel shortage and puts further strain on the officers who remain.  Already, Navy officers fret there are signs that the death spiral is beginning. The aircraft carriers Kennedy and Coral Sea recently put their crews through substantially extended tours. Meanwhile, a host of technically trained Navy specialists are shucking their uniforms sooner than they used to. Sonar technicians, vital to searching the oceans for Soviet submarines, are leaving the Navy on average a full year sooner than they did in 1983. Electronic-warfare technicians and gas-turbine operators are also shortening their stays.  Meanwhile, commercial airlines are aggressively courting Navy aviators, promising higher pay and an easier life. The Navy\\'s retention rate for aviators, while much higher than in the late 1970s, has slid from its peak in 1983.  \"We\\'re all competing for the same people,\" says Adm. Carlson. \"The people IBM Corp. wants are the people we want.\"  Many more junior officers are married these days, making the long sea tours more of a problem. Ten years ago, says Capt. Charles Cramer, it was thought that \"if you were supposed to have a wife, one would be issued with your sea bag. Now you have to reenlist the family. If mom doesn\\'t want you to go back to sea, you usually don\\'t go.\"  Adm. Carlson says one good way to retain experienced officers is \"to give them a bag of money.\" Currently, he is fighting off congressional cuts in a bonus pool the Navy taps to give strategic enlisted personnel as much as $30,000 to reenlist. Half of the bonus is handed out at the beginning with the rest distributed over the term of additional service. Last year, Congress cut $30 million out of this reenlistment-bonus pool for the current fiscal year, however, forcing the Navy to trim many of its bonuses. The Navy estimates that, as a result, 1,500 petty officers will decide not to reenlist.  The influx of women in the Navy is apparently adding to the personnel problems. Because women aren\\'t assigned to combat ships, they congregate in the shore billets that male personnel count on after long tours at sea. According to the Navy, the ranks of female officers have increased dramatically while personnel growth overall has been constrained, thereby adding to strains on male officers.  Earlier this year, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Carlisle Trost placed a ceiling on female recruits to prevent a future dramatic increase in female officers assigned to shore billets. He was overruled by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, however.  Meanwhile, the decline in the number of 18-to-21-year-olds is going to hit around the time the Navy will be most hard-pressed to staff the 600-ship fleet. The Pentagon figures that by 1990 it will need to recruit into the military services one out of every 34 eligible men and women, compared with one out of every 38 today.  Says Adm. Carlson: \"We have the toughest time. It\\'s very hard recruiting to this monk-like existence.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0168': 'Robert Prechter Title Of Wall Street Guru --- Technical Analyst Is Successor To Granville, Mendelson; Preparing for a Cataclysm --- By Cynthia Crossen Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Outside the window is rural Georgia, a vista of leggy pines surrounding a sprawling lake.  Inside is bedlam.  A brisk round of buying has just sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up sharply, and Robert R. Prechter and some of his staff are trying to figure out what\\'s going on. A half-dozen phone lines blink impatiently as subscribers to Mr. Prechter\\'s consulting service wait for marching orders. Other employees process newsletter subscriptions and bills on computer terminals. As the day wears on, the noise level in the room rises to a dull roar, not unlike the din heard on Wall Street trading desks more than 800 miles away.  This is the home of the Elliott wave principle, an arcane system of technical analysis that thousands of investors have come to believe is the Rosetta stone of the stock market. Mr. Prechter, 37 years old, is the theory\\'s champion and oracle, and his influence on the market extends far beyond the subscribers to his newsletter, the Elliott Wave Theorist.  Rumors about Mr. Prechter\\'s latest calls galvanize traders across the country. As a result, he is often credited, or blamed, for sudden shifts in the stock market and praised for his prescience. Early last July, Mr. Prechter advised his subscribers to take profits on short-term positions. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 79 points the following week, many people held Mr. Prechter responsible. In early September, he issued another warning, and the average dropped more than 120 points a short time later. Monday before last, when the market fell more than 28 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, market watchers noted that Mr. Prechter had told hot-line subscribers the previous Friday night that the market was vulnerable to a correction.  Of course, Mr. Prechter has also made many wrong calls, most notably in the short-term stock market and in bonds. So far, his Wall Street followers have dismissed them as minor flaws in an exceptional record, but the role of market guru is difficult to sustain for long. Wall Street is fickle, and some of Mr. Prechter\\'s predecessors, like Joseph Granville, Henry Kaufman and John A. Mendelson, know that a few bad calls can turn the public\\'s adulation to derision. \"No one can be right 100% of the time,\" says Mr. Granville.  Mr. Prechter\\'s popularity comes at a time when technical analysis, the system of predicting stock prices using past price and volume statistics, has been making a comeback on Wall Street. The technicians\\' rivals, the fundamentalists, have been unable to explain how the current economic situation justifies a 20% gain in the stock market since the beginning of the year. The startling volatility of the market has also undermined the fundamentalists\\' view that investors behave rationally.  But technical analysis continues to be regarded skeptically by many academicians and money managers. Hundreds of studies of market patterns have failed to find one that can make consistently accurate predictions. Furthermore, critics say, if such a system could be found, it would be neutralized very quickly by the rush of investors using it.  \"I tend to classify technical analysis like Tarot,\" says Stephen Figlewski, a professor of finance at New York University. \"The people who use it successfully -- if there are such people -- bring a lot more to it than just charts.\"  Some also argue that a record as good as Mr. Prechter\\'s may well be pure chance. \"Most people don\\'t understand that with stochastic {random} systems, you can get lucky and have a long string of good calls,\" says James B. Ramsey, a professor of economics at New York University. \"It\\'s a low-probability event, but it\\'s not a zero-probability event.\"  Like other technicians, Mr. Prechter favors one kind of chart but uses others to support or challenge his initial conclusions. His primary system is based on patterns first discerned -- or, some would say, fabricated -- in the late 1930s by Ralph N. Elliott, an accountant who had lost some of his savings in the 1929 stock-market crash.  The idea behind the Elliott principle is that stock prices are a barometer of the national mood and that the mood moves in predictable waves between optimism and pessimism. The waves, which are based on stock-market data, unfold in specific sequences. For example, the waves in a bull-market rally will go up, down, up, down and up, followed by a correction in which waves will go down, up, down. Each wave contains smaller series of waves so that, for example, between January and July of 1984, the market was in a second wave on one scale and a fifth wave on another. A single large wave can last as long as several centuries; one that occurs within other waves can last as short a time as an hour.  In what Elliott and Mr. Prechter call the Grand Supercycle, or the largest scale identified so far, the market is now in a fifth wave, and it won\\'t end until the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 3686 sometime in 1988. After that, Mr. Prechter says, expect a cataclysm worse than the 1929 crash. Then, if history repeats itself, and Mr. Prechter firmly believes it does, a depression and major war will follow.  Sweeping predictions like these sometimes make Mr. Prechter seem more like a religious figure than a stock-market analyst. And, indeed, some of his followers think of him that way. Alan Wolman, a Maryland trader and subscriber who says he has made a million dollars following Mr. Prechter\\'s advice, remembers going to a seminar where Mr. Prechter was speaking. \"A lot of traders and analysts were standing around, and all of a sudden Prechter walked in and it was as if the messiah had just walked in,\" says Mr. Wolman. \"Everybody just stopped and gravitated toward him.\"  Furthermore, Mr. Prechter -- who received a psychology degree from Yale University and played drums in a rock band before starting his career as a technical analyst for Merrill Lynch -- unabashedly applies the wave theory to everything from hemlines to rock music. That reinforces the impression of him as a cult leader, with a deterministic world view explaining almost everything, past and future.  Far-fetched as some of his theories sound, Mr. Prechter\\'s intelligent and dispassionate delivery gives pause. His confidence in the Elliott wave principle is unwavering, and he bridles at any criticism of it or of himself. But unlike many who preceded him as Wall Street guru, Mr. Prechter concedes that he has made bad calls before and will do so again. \"The last thing I want to do is build up this idea that \\'Hey, I have the answer to the market, and I\\'m not going to make any more mistakes.\\' There are people out there who claim perfect accuracy, but they\\'ve grabbed a shovel and started digging their own graves.\"  Some money managers, like David Dreman, a managing director of Dreman Value Management, say that volatile markets make technical analysts look good. But Mr. Dreman says that he has never heard of a technician who has made a lot of money in the stock market. \"I would challenge a technician to show a record of successfully managing money,\" he says.  Mr. Prechter has heard that challenge before, and in 1984 he called his critics\\' bluff by entering the U.S. Trading Championships sponsored by the Financial Traders Association. Using the Elliott wave principle, he won the options division and set a record, increasing the value of his portfolio by 444.4% in four months of trading. Mr. Prechter says he is mostly out of the options and futures game now. His own money is in blue-chip mutual funds or money-market funds, and he says that he has no interest in managing other people\\'s money.  Although most people remember only his accurate calls, Mr. Prechter has also had his share of blunders. He himself concedes that beginning in 1985, he consistently called the bond market wrong for more than a year. \"I shorted bonds three times on the way up,\" he says. Other investors contend that his gold forecasts have cost them money.  Mr. Prechter says that his interpretations, not the charts he uses, should be blamed for the bad calls. Furthermore, he says, anyone could take the same charts and, with a certain amount of discipline, do what he does. \"Nobody needs me,\" he says. \"All I do is take Elliott\\'s observations and using those patterns and guidelines, I rank the probabilities of the likely paths of the market. It\\'s just a matter of memorizing the patterns and their implications.\"  Nobody may need him, but Mr. Prechter makes his living from those who think they do. His monthly newsletter, with occasional interim reports, costs $233 a year, and a third or more of his roughly 15,000 subscribers pay an additional $377 a year for his thrice-weekly hot line. Subscribers may also call one of his three assistants for instant advice at the rate of $30 a minute.  To the critics who wonder why a person who is so smart about the market makes his living -- albeit a good one -- writing a newsletter, Mr. Prechter quotes a friend who also writes a newsletter. \"I want other people to know how smart I am,\" he says.  As certain as Mr. Prechter is of the Elliott wave principle, he also knows that \"hot hands\" in the market often have short lives. \"I\\'m probably going to be wrong about something in some big way around the top,\" he says. \"Undoubtedly the top will take too long and probably I\\'ll put out caution too early, in which case people will say baloney on this crash stuff.\"  In the meantime, Mr. Prechter feels that he is a target for all those who dislike technical analysis in general and hot technicians specifically. \"There are people who hate the idea that anyone can be successful at predicting the market,\" he says. \"I just try to avoid them. But sometimes you walk out on the dusty street at noon, and there\\'s some guy standing there with his guns.\" ',\n",

Hawley, chairman and chief executive officer, said.  Year-earlier net income was $19 million, or 58 cents a share. The company expects to post sales of about $1.3 billion, the same as a year ago, he said.  Earnings for the quarter ended Feb. 1 included a pre-tax charge of $25 million related to a recapitalization and an after-tax charge of $30 million for early retirement of debt, Mr. Hawley said.  For the fiscal year, the retail chain operator expects to report net income of about $4 million, down 92% from $48 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. There were no per-share earnings for the year after payment of the preferred dividend. The fiscal 1987 earnings include an after-tax charge of $15 million for software-development expenses that had previously been capitalized, Mr. Hawley said.  Sales rose to about $4.1 billion from $4 billion, an increase of 2.5%. Year-ago sales included about $80 million from the Holt Renfrew &amp; Co. chain and one month of sales from the John Wanamaker chain, both of which have been sold. On a continuing operations basis, sales for the year just ended rose about 3% from a year earlier, Mr. Hawley said.  Under a restructuring plan designed to thwart a hostile takeover bid, Carter Hawley is in the process of spinning off its specialty-store chains into a separate company. Under the plan, Carter Hawley holders will receive $17 in cash and stock in the new company, which may be named Neiman-Marcus Group for the company's principal operations. Current holders will retain their stock in a leaner Carter Hawley, which will operate its 115 department stores.  Before the special charges, Carter Hawley's pre-tax earnings in the fiscal fourth-quarter were $66 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $24 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier, Mr. Hawley said. For the fiscal year, pre-tax earnings before the special charges were $140 million, or $2.44 a share, compared with $72 million, or $1.05 a share, a year ago.

       " 'WSJ870318-0166': 'Free-Market Rhetoric Cloaks Abuses</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> As the former head of Stakeholders in America, a group dealing with abuses of hostile takeovers and related defenses, and as CEO of a New York Stock Exchange company, I would comment on Richard Rustin\\'s \"Self-Regulation Dies on the Street\" (editorial page, Feb. 24).  Mr. Rustin argues that NYSE self-regulation is flawed, suggesting \"The SEC should take direct control of the systems that track stock volume and prices, and it should have greatly expanded responsibility for monitoring brokerage firms\\' sales practices and finances and for disciplining wrongdoers.\" Possibly so, but the issues are broader and run deeper than quick-fix remedies.  While both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and the SEC are considered independent, few would argue that the position of the administration is without influence. The administration has applied free-market rhetoric to the trade deficit, to the waning of national energy security from cartel oil pricing below the level of domestic subsistence, and to the erosion of American competitiveness contributed to by the hostile-takeover plague.  The primary takeover predators have in turn cried \"Let the free market prevail\" as a principal defense against administration, congressional, Justice Department, or SEC action.  Meanwhile, effective investigation by government professionals has pierced the veil and attacked but one link in the chain of abuse of insider information by arbitrageurs. One needs recognize that the chain originates in the aura of benign neglect of administration public policy and is quickly fed by the greed of raiders. The results are quick profits to the primary predators, enormous wins to the insider retinue of lawyers, bankers, investment bankers, all at the expense of shareholders as well as to the critical link of arbitrageurs who often hold control of a corporation and its losing constituencies for a matter of days.  There is sufficient fault within flawed policy to go round. It need not be focused on the NYSE, nor need the SEC be portrayed as sole savior. Rather than a quick-fix approach, Congress needs to address broader policy elements. These raids on corporations contain immense unrecognized and unreimbursed social costs for the special benefit of the few big winners.  Should the role of the SEC be elevated, perhaps that venerable agency might address whether the typical raider disclosure to the SEC at the 5% threshold reporting level of \"for investment purposes\" constitutes adequate or accurate representation of intent. Or perhaps what the true game plan is, how it will be financed, and what the impact is expected to be on the affected constituencies -- shareholders, employees, debt-holders, communities, pensioners, and customers. Those fashioning the governance of the SEC might well consider at least one member of that body being fully experienced in investigatory matters. Also, the close working relationship between the SEC and NASD should be noted.  Meanwhile, possibly America\\'s best interim defense has been hauling off a few important, but thus far miscellaneous, players in handcuffs.  Raymond Plank Chairman and CEO Apache Corp. Denver',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0165': 'Reducing Cholesterol</HL> Your reportage on cholesterol (second front page, Feb. 24) is informative, and your writers, Jerry E. Bishop and Michael Waldholz, correctly emphasize that \"The first line of defense is a low-fat diet, cutting fat to 30% or less of total calories, from the 40% consumed by most Americans.\" But readers must realize that to cut fat to 30% of total calories requires a cut in fat by weight to 15% of the diet! This is so because each gram of fat contributes 9.5 calories, whereas each gram of protein or carbohydrate contributes only 4.1 calories. Food labels specify protein, carbohydrate, and fat content by weight -- not by calories.  An analysis of milk illustrates my point. Fat constitutes 29% of the food content of whole milk by weight but contributes 49% to its calorie content. Fat constitutes 10% of the food content of low-fat milk by weight but contributes 20% to its calorie content. (Low-fat milk, by the way, is misleadingly labeled as containing only 1% fat because milk is mostly water, but water has no food or calorie content.) Finally, fat constitutes 5% of the food content of skimmed milk, and this contributes 10% to its calorie content. Even skimmed milk is not fat free!  A decrease in the caloric contribution of fat in the diet requires a dramatic change in the fat content of foods consumed. Simply decreasing the fat content of food to less than 30% is not good enough -- the goal must be a fat content of less than 15% to achieve a caloric contribution of less than 30%. For example, someone consuming 2,000 calories per day should eat no more than 60 grams of fat per day in order to keep the caloric contribution to less than 30% of total calories. Dietary recommendations from health authorities should be presented in terms of food weight, as well as calories, because weight is what the public finds on food labels.

Drexler, president and chief executive officer, said.  The company doesn\\'t break out fourth-quarter results.  Per-share earnings last year rose only \"marginally\" from 1985\\'s $3.33 because of about one million more average common shares outstanding. For 1986, Allied had about 4.3 million average common outstanding, compared with 3.1 million in 1985. The company made a public offering of about one million shares in June and issued about 600,000 new shares for two acquisitions.  The 1985 results included a $1.1 million gain on debt repayment and a $5.8 million tax benefit. For the year, operating profit was $3.6 million, or $1.14 a share.  Mr. Drexler said the boost in earnings last year was due mostly to several acquisitions and the consolidation of certain operations.  In late 1985, Allied acquired White Farm Equipment Co. Last year, it also bought Verson Allsteel Press Co. and Lilliston Corp. Because of these additions, the company expects to report an increase in 1986 sales of roughly 50% to about $414 million from $276.1 million in 1985, Mr. Drexler said in an interview.  He also said the company consolidated its tillage operations, moving production from its Galesburg, Kan., plant to its Kewanee, Ill., facility. Allied also moved its peanut handling-equipment production from its Albany, Ga., factory to its Selma, Ala., plant.  As the company reaps the full benefits of the recent acquisitions and consolidations \"we expect operating profit and sales (in 1987) to be up over 1986,\" Mr. Drexler said. Allied plans further consolidations, including the reduction in the number of its farm-equipment distribution warehouses to 11 from 21 by the end of April, Mr. Drexler said. The company is also expecting to introduce 20 new farm-equipment products this year, which should help boost earnings, he added.  Allied continues to look for more acquisitions \"to round out existing product lines or to pick up a new product,\" Mr. Drexler said. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0163': 'Origins of the Word Hoosier</HL> Being an Indiana native, I immediately took offense at the supposed derivation of the word Hoosier as \"a dirty person, a tramp\" (letter, Feb. 24). By consulting with a local historian, Shirley Straw, I have learned the folklore of the origin of the word. When Indiana was the Wild West, settlers and Indians often took vengeance on each other by cutting off the ears of their enemies. These ears were often worn on belts and found later on dead warriors. A standing joke was made with the phrase \"Whose ear?\" which was quickly picked up by the residents of Indiana as their nickname. Other folklore speculates the phrase \"who\\'s \\'er\"\\' when company knocked at the log cabin door is the origin.  John Pfister Fort Branch, Ind. --- Let\\'s leave it to a Kansan -- the late, great Jayhawk basketball coach Phog Allen -- to settle the burning question of the etymology of Hoosiers. Allen provides the answer in a vignette in his 1947 book, \"Coach Phog Allen\\'s Sports Stories,\" about the invention of the football helmet:  \"It was particularly popular with Indiana players who practiced in the sand-dune country. When scrimmaging, these Indiana boys would grind their opponents\\' heads into the earth with disastrous results. After the scrimmage, players would go about picking up the the loose ears of their opponents and saying, \\'Whose ears?\\' Ever since, Indiana teams have been known as Hoosiers.\"  There is a photo in the book of the league-champion Kansas team of 1942-43. Proudly wearing No. 6 is one Bob Dole, a fine athlete who was shortly to enlist in the Army.  Stanley Hamilton Alexandria, Va. --- One popular theory is that the word stems from \"husher,\" which refers to one who could hush another with his fists.  If letter-writer Hochland would spend a little time with some native Hoosiers from the rolling limestone hill country, he would find them neither dirty persons nor tramps -- quite the contrary.  Paul A. Lee Elm Grove, Wis. --- The present-day meaning of Hoosier in Indiana was used as far back as 1829. The word comes from the Cumberland dialect word \"hoozer,\" meaning anything unusually large.  Jim Houlihan Goleta, Calif.',\n",

The energy and fertilizer concern said it recently sold the last of its stake in Imperial Continental Gas Association for the current equivalent of about $75.2 million. This sale, together with the previous sale of Imperial Continental shares accounted for the gain, Gulf Resources said.  In the year-earlier period, Gulf Resources reported a net loss of $703,000, on revenue of $33.4 million. Gulf Resources wouldn't estimate the impact the gain will have on current first-quarter results.  Gulf Resources said it tendered its last 6.6 million shares of Imperial Continental common stock and 100,000 units of convertible loan stock to Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. and Tractebel S.A. The two European companies are trying to gain control of Imperial Continental's stake in Petrofina S.A., a Belgian oil company, and in several Belgian utilities. The recent sale enabled the two companies to acquire an additional 7.3% stake in Imperial Continental.  Under the terms of their tender offer, if another offer is made for Imperial Continental, or its Calor Group or Contibel holdings, that is in excess of the current equivalent of about $11.34 a share, Gulf Resources is entitled to extra money from the two companies, said a Gulf Resources spokesman. The new offer must be made before January 1, 1988.  Last year, Gulf Resources made a $970 million bid for Imperial Continental, but dropped the proposal after it was referred to the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission by the Department of Trade and Industry. Gulf Resources said this could have delayed its bid for months. \",\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0160': 'Viennese Beethoven Week Sells Out Carnegie --- By Raymond Sokolov</HL> Even before the local press blew its trumpets, alert concert goers and scene makers had turned the Vienna Philharmonic\\'s six-evening Beethoven series into the biggest success Carnegie Hall has yet had in this year of its face lift. The all-male orchestra promised a hypermacho program: all nine of Beethoven\\'s symphonies, all five of his piano concertos, and his overtures, under Claudio Abbado and with pianist Maurizio Pollini.  It was a press agent\\'s dream. The program itself commanded attention, proclaimed itself as monumental. Then there was the potential drama of watching the intricate Mr. Abbado, recently arrived in Vienna from La Scala in Milan, try to enforce his musical will on the notably self-possessed Philharmonic. And there was the even more intricate Mr. Pollini, prodigious technician, cool-hearted modernist, Milanese intellectual.  Would this week of masterpieces collapse of its own weight? Or would it launch the new series of Deutsche Grammophon recordings for which it was, in a not-very-subtle way, a live ad? Finally, to be crude about it, was the whole business worth almost a solid week of evenings for the unprecedented top price of $75 a seat?  The link between money and music has rarely been so vividly put before us, or so conveniently. And in the crush of the intermission crowd in the still-unrefurbished Carnegie Cafe, for example, you could make out financier Henry R. Kravis (\"$10,000 or more,\" according to the program, but less than $25,000) holding the full attention of the hall\\'s president, violinist Isaac Stern (\"$150,000 or more\" but less than $250,000). Mrs. Kravis is the much-photographed dress designer known to fashion as Carolyne Roehm. She is also a Beethovenian, but the most Beethovenian couturier in all of New York was Oscar de la Renta. His friends, including Annette Reed ($150,000 or more), who sat next to him, provided support for the Vienna series \"in recognition of his deep interest in music and his assistance to Carnegie Hall.\"  It is, of course, a short distance along Seventh Avenue from Carnegie Hall to the heart of the garment industry, but it is an even shorter trip along much the same route to the leading local newspaper, whose critics went elsewhere for four of the six Vienna concerts, thereby missing all but one of Mr. Pollini\\'s appearances.  Lacking the usual guidance on what to think about a concert, I took to buttonholing acquaintances in the audience. Almost no one refused to opine, or shrugged me off, saying, \"Gee, I dunno. I wish the Times had sent someone last night.\"  On the basis of my informal sampling, there was remarkable consensus on several matters. Everyone polled had noticed and greatly admired the Philharmonic\\'s oboes and brass, which are built differently from the ones common in our orchestras, and seem to have more character. And you could hear them with wonderful clarity. The peach-and-gilt new interior of the hall showed itself off acoustically to best advantage for the Philharmonic, whose string sections sounded rich and distinct among each other. The assembled donors could feel proud of their gift to New York musical life, but were too discreet to boast.  They were willing, however, to speculate freely on the unresolvable question of whether Mr. Abbado was truly in charge or, if so, whether that was a good thing. Smart money came out saying that the comparatively subdued maestro had ratcheted his players a notch or two above their usual level of intensity.  Mr. Pollini did not have complex problems of identity or institutional politics to combat. He had only himself to discipline, and he was equal to the challenge. Small and undramatic, he appears to have the strongest wrists outside organized baseball. With a minimum of body English or even arm movement, he is able to extract whatever sounds he wants from the piano by moving his remarkable hands at the wrist. And when he stood up to acknowledge the audience\\'s loud praise, those hands would waggle like separate creatures. He reminded one woman of a surgeon washing up before an operation.  His performance was surgical, meaning clean and accurate, with arpeggios shimmering up and down the octaves, each note in place. These luxurious cascades invariably came to an end with aplomb, leaving Mr. Pollini ideally positioned to move ahead with the next musical idea.  Not everyone cottoned to this approach. One haunter of concert halls and opera houses confessed that \"Pollini is too intellectual for me.\" But the man said this before Mr. Pollini had played the Emperor, letting himself, but never his technique, go to the point where he moved rhythmically with the orchestra when he had no notes to play himself. At climactic moments, he even used his whole arms and shoulders.  New York\\'s Vienna week ended Friday with a jubilant Choral Symphony, big but not bombastic. If anyone was bored after a week of such warhorses played back to back, I never met him. Or her. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0159': 'Debate Over Effects on Children --- By Linda Watkins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN> After the cartoon show \"Pound Puppies\" on a recent Saturday morning, WXEX-TV in Richmond, Va., aired a commercial quite different from the usual pitches for Cocoa Puffs or Barbie. As moppets watched, teen-age actor Scott Grimes explained that the deadly disease AIDS can\\'t be caught by sharing pencils or schoolbooks.  Then it was on to Bugs Bunny.  Though many early-morning cartoon viewers range from two to eight years old, WXEX says they aren\\'t too young for basic education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \"Kids are hearing the word \\'AIDS\\' daily,\" explains Neva Snell, the station\\'s assistant promotions manager. \"Why not let them know it isn\\'t something they have to be afraid of?\"  But, like the airing of condom commercials to help combat the spread of the disease, the AIDS-education commercials for young children are sparking controversy. Some parents and child-care experts wonder what, if anything, cartoon-watchers make of the commercials, no matter how innocuous and well-meaning.  \"To introduce the concept of AIDS to children without a foundation would probably be frightening, inappropriate and not very successful,\" says Dr. Francis Palumbo, an associate professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University. \"They have got to know what it is before you can tell them how not to get it.\" AIDS public-service spots should be aired during programs directed at older children, he says.  Although no count is available, it appears that only a few stations now show AIDS-education spots during children\\'s programs. But the number could increase sharply this summer -- after WNEV-TV in Boston, along with Action for Children\\'s Television, finishes a new series of AIDS-education spots and programs.  Proponents insist that it is important for television to help educate children of all ages about AIDS -- to end fear of how it spreads and prejudice against victims. Though most victims are adults, 460 U.S. children under 13 have been diagnosed as having AIDS (including 291 who have already died), says the federal Centers for Disease Control. Medical authorities say some children with AIDS contracted it through transfusions of tainted blood; most caught AIDS at or near birth, from mothers infected with the virus.  Some children with AIDS have been ostracized by classmates, in part because of misconceptions that it can be spread by casual contact.  The AIDS commercials now aired during children\\'s programs aren\\'t sexually explicit; in fact, they don\\'t mention how AIDS is transmitted. The commercials\\' proponents say it is enough to dispel myths -- by explaining how AIDS isn\\'t transmitted.  William Gussner, the superintendent of schools in Wilmette, Ill., says he favors spots that provide children -- even pre-schoolers -- with basic information. He says myths were initially a problem at one Wilmette school when a child there was diagnosed as having AIDS.  \"For young people to be talking to other young people, saying you don\\'t need to be afraid of a kid who has AIDS . . .. is good,\" says Holly Smith, the media-relations coordinator of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. \"That isn\\'t talking about anal and vaginal intercourse. I don\\'t think that\\'s appropriate.\"  In the 30-second spot featuring Scott Grimes, the star of \"Who\\'s the Boss?\" says: \"What does a kid know about AIDS? I know it\\'s a serious disease that some kids have. But I\\'m not worried about getting AIDS from them, because you can\\'t get AIDS from sharing pencils, schoolbooks or just by being around someone.\"  Officials at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which produced the commercial and has shown it during a Sunday-afternoon show about pets and during its \"Evening Magazine,\" think the spot is effective even though it isn\\'t explicit, partly because it provides a telephone number that people can dial to get more AIDS information. Ms. Snell in Richmond adds that WXEX wouldn\\'t have run the spot if it said that AIDS is sexually transmitted or that a person could die from the disease.  AIDS spots for children may become more explicit. WNEV in Boston hasn\\'t yet scripted the AIDS spots it is producing, but they may involve cartoon characters and references to sex. \"Kids aren\\'t dumb,\" says Dr. Alan Xenokis, the station\\'s health expert. \"People who underestimate the curiosity and intelligence of children are making a sad mistake.\"  Viewers\\' responses to the less explicit AIDS spots now being run have been mixed. Neither KPIX nor WXEX has received any complaints. But five callers complained to WFXT-TV in Boston after the station -- by accident, it claims -- twice ran AIDS commercials during children\\'s programs, including early-morning cartoons. \"Callers felt that children are too young for that subject,\" reports Linda Waring, WFXT\\'s public-service director.  Some child-care experts agree that children under eight to 10 probably won\\'t understand AIDS commercials. For those kids, says Dr. James Strain, the executive director of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a 30-second spot may raise more questions than it answers.  Even some people who favor more AIDS education wonder if TV commercials are effective. \"The kind of abstract thinking required to understand how AIDS works, spreads and can kill you is very sophisticated,\" says Dr. William Dietz, a pediatrician at New England Medical Center in Boston. He has tried to explain to his 10-year-old daughter how a condom offers protection. \"I\\'m still not sure it\\'s something she really understands,\" he says.  Some other parents also have doubts, especially for younger children. Lynette Thomas, a Boston mother with a six-year-old son, says: \"At his age they don\\'t even know about sex. They need to know more about their own bodies before they learn about other things like AIDS.\"  Still, Dr. Strain says 13- and 14-year-olds are mature enough to understand commercials explaining that AIDS can be transmitted by the exchange of body fluids during sexual intercourse and that the disease is more common among homosexuals. Dr. Palumbo suggests that commercials aimed at children aged 12 and up could mention AIDS as one consequence of promiscuity, without going into details about how one catches it.  Longer educational programs about AIDS -- either instead of or in addition to commercials -- may be more valuable, Drs. Strain and Palumbo say. For children over age 15, Dr. Palumbo says, programs could be more explicit about what causes AIDS. \"Here, you really are talking to people who know what\\'s going on,\" he says. Still, he adds that he would begin such a show with a warning that the program contained sexually explicit information.  Another Richmond station, WWBT-TV, won\\'t run AIDS commercials for young children, but station officials would consider late-night spots geared toward people over age 12. \"I understand they are in a substantially higher risk group for AIDS,\" explains John Hutchinson, the vice president and general manager.  But that approach also poses problems. Notes Michael Seagly, the operations manager at WZZM-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich.: \"It\\'s very difficult to separate programs for teen-agers from programs for children.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0158': '--- By Victor A. Canto</HL> FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) </IN> Many policy makers view short-run changes in exchange rates as a convenient means of enhancing the \"competitiveness\" of the economy and improving the trade balance. In pursuit of this policy objective, however, changes in nominal exchange rates often are confused with changes in real exchange rates, and the integrated nature of today\\'s world economy is ignored. This is unfortunate, since changes in nominal and real exchange rates differ in their impact on the economy much as changes in nominal and real interest rates do.  The nominal exchange rate simply measures the value of one currency in terms of another. The real exchange rate, or terms of trade, measures the value of goods produced in one country in terms of goods produced in other countries.  In our integrated world economy, there are both tradeable goods (such as oil or grain) and nontradeable goods (such as haircuts). Absent trade restrictions, there is only one market for tradeable goods -- the world market -- and only one price -- the world price.  Changes in nominal exchange rates result from monetary policy actions and deliberate devaluations. Imagine that after a 10% deliberate devaluation of the dollar, the price of wheat in Chicago falls 10% below the price of wheat in London. At that spread, trading companies would be willing to buy up the entire U.S. wheat crop and ship it to Britain. The price of wheat would rise in the U.S. and the price differential would be dissipated immediately. This creates arbitrage opportunities. And what is true for wheat is ultimately true for all other goods and services.  Consequently, a deliberate devaluation in the dollar only increases the rate of inflation by the same amount. Not surprisingly, inflation increased after President Nixon devalued the dollar by 10% in August 1971.  In contrast, a change in the real exchange rate has real effects on the economy and need not be associated with inflation. Changes in the real exchange rate may result from tax-rate changes, other fiscal policy actions or even oil price shocks.  For example, if the Saudis raise the price of oil relative to the price of U.S. manufactured goods, this would shift the terms of trade between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. If the monetary authorities in both countries are committed to the goal of stable prices, the assumed changes in the terms of trade would cause the dollar to depreciate relative to the riyal without producing a change in the inflation-rate differential between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.  Of course, non-offsetting changes in the real and nominal exchange rates may also occur. When both the real and nominal exchange rates fall, the resulting decline in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar is inflationary only to the extent that the decline in the nominal exchange rate exceeds the decline in the real exchange rate.  The experience in the 1970s clearly illustrates this point. From 1973 through 1976, the nominal exchange rate appreciated; it then declined during 1977-78. By the end of 1978, the nominal exchange rate had returned to its 1973 level.  Although a dollar bought the same amount of foreign currency as it did in 1973, U.S. goods bought 15% more foreign goods in 1978. In other words, the real exchange rate appreciated by 15%. Consequently, there was a change in the competitive position of the U.S. economy.  The U.S. is currently pursuing a monetary policy committed to price stability. Inflation is virtually zero. In such an environment, any change in the value of the dollar is simply a change in the real exchange rate.  An appreciation of the real exchange rate implies a higher rate of return is available for investments in the U.S. When the real exchange rate is higher, every American product brings more in terms of foreign goods.  The sharp reductions in tax rates implemented by the Reagan administration during its first term dramatically increased the after-tax return on investments in the U.S. Not surprisingly, this caused a sharp increase in the demand for dollars and U.S. goods, which led in turn to a higher real exchange rate.  In an integrated economy, however, arbitrage through capital flows eventually will bring the return on investments back into line and, in the process, cause the real exchange rate to return to its long-run relationship with other currencies.  Recall that the dollar started its rise in 1981 when the Reagan tax-rate cuts were partially implemented and peaked in 1984 after the tax-rate cuts were fully effective. Since the subsequent decline in the value of the dollar was accompanied by virtually no inflation, one may infer that the change in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar was due only to a change in the terms of trade. Indeed, it could be argued that since 1985 the decline in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar, as weighted by gross national product, has simply returned the dollar to its 1980 value. Whether this adjustment is complete, however, depends upon the long-run value of the dollar. Since the dollar remains about 15% higher than in 1977, it could fall further.  Finally, when the Reagan administration\\'s latest round of tax-rate cuts becomes fully effective, the after-tax return on U.S. investments will increase further. This will cause the real exchange rate to rise again -- even with price stability at home.  --- Mr. Canto is president of A.B. Laffer Associates of Lomita, Calif.

Floating-rate note trading continued to be volatile, as it has been for the past three sessions. But the fact that some issues had fallen as much as two to three points since the middle of last week lured back investors, spurring a rebound.  Major U.S. bank issues, which had some of the sharpest declines in the past few sessions, closed as much as one point higher. Some sovereign issues were 1/2 point higher.  Japanese banks, which are major holders of floating-rate notes, reportedly weren\\'t active, partly because they are reluctant to open big new positions just before the March 31 close of their fiscal year.

       " 'WSJ870318-0133': 'Dump the Double Nickel</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The 55-mile-per-hour speed limit is the most widely violated statute since Prohibition. Today, the House will likely vote on an amendment to the highway bill that would allow states to increase speed limits on rural interstate highways to as much as 65 mph. Last month, the Senate approved this modest change by a vote of 65-33. Such a move is overdue.  In 1985, up to 90% of Maryland motorists were violating the national 55-mph limit imposed after the gas shortage of 1973. The state was threatened with the cutoff of almost $6 million in federal highway construction funds. Suddenly, as the Washington Post reported, \"everything changed.\" Fewer than half of the motorists were recorded as breaking the limit during 1986.  Was this a law-enforcement miracle? Nothing had actually \"changed.\" The state simply had moved several of its roadside speed monitoring machines to places where traffic was slower -- hills, congested areas.  Maryland is only the latest in a parade of jurisdictions trying to evade federal sanctions for not enforcing an outdated and costly anachronism. So many cook their enforcement books that 37 states would be in noncompliance if accurate statistics were kept.  It is claimed that the 55 limit saves 4,000 lives a year, but it is unclear how many of these would have been saved without it. The rate of traffic fatalities has declined steadily since 1922, and continues to do so even as noncompliance with the 55 limit grows.  Charles Lave, an economist with the University of California at Irvine, argues that it isn\\'t so much high speeds that cause accidents, but cars going either much faster or slower than other traffic. \"When most cars are traveling at about the same speed, whether it is a high or low one, the fatality rate will be low. Variance kills, not speed,\" he says. Mr. Lave suggests that states consider reviving the \"minimum-speed\" laws that were strictly enforced before the 55 limit.  The head of the California Highway Patrol, J.M. Barnett, believes the current limit \"uses up patrol resources on activities that have little effect on safety, while ignoring activities that would make a real difference\" in saving lives -- such as the pursuit of drunk drivers. Even the National Research Council, which believes the 55 limit does save many lives, recommends the limit be lifted on the rural interstates that are the focus of today\\'s vote.  The argument over the savings in lives or fuel is not conclusive, but the principle of federalism is. Who is the better judge of traffic-safety needs on, say, I-80 in Nevada? Local officials, or 535 members of Congress, almost none of whom have ever driven that stretch of highway? On such roads there\\'s more danger that drivers will fall asleep from boredom than that they will careen into a car.  The 55-mile-per-hour limit costs Americans one billion hours of extra driving time a year. The fact that 55 has lingered on the books unchanged this long is a powerful argument for having future congressional regulations include a built-in sunset clause. If the House doesn\\'t let states lift the 55-mph limit on rural interstates, we suggest drivers make productive use of their extra time on the road: contemplating ways to retire those members who have lashed them to their steering wheels.

       " 'WSJ870318-0130': 'Democrats Who Won\\'t Run</HL> Candidates used to wait until it was actually the year of the presidential election before announcing. No longer. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said Monday he would seek the 1988 Democratic nomination. By Memorial Day, he and a dozen other candidates will be trudging through Iowa and New Hampshire in search of the few voters not already turned off by presidential politics. This campaign\\'s boredom threshold promises to be reached even earlier than usual.  In the current issue of the Atlantic Monthly, political analyst William Schneider provides an interesting \"Consumers\\' Guide\" to the Democratic presidential candidates -- one we hope he duplicates for the Republicans. It is no fault of Mr. Schneider\\'s but after 19 pages we weren\\'t much able to tell the Democrats apart. Was it Dale Bumpers who wanted to make \"competitiveness\" his major issue? Did Richard Gephardt or Joe Biden like worker-training accounts?  But what really caught our eye in the article was that the most interesting parts -- a third of the piece -- focused on five Democrats who have already announced they will not, or almost certainly will not, be candidates in 1988. These same Democrats -- Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Sen. Ted Kennedy, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and former Gov. Chuck Robb of Virginia -- happened to be the most intriguing and thought-provoking of the people Mr. Schneider talked with.  But none of the above are running. Instead we will have two repeat candidates from 1984 -- Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- and a collection of newcomers who remind one of, well, Gary Hart. All appear to be technocratic problem solvers, sort of political Mr. Goodwrench types. All are qualified, but none really represent either an exciting reaffirmation of the Democratic Party\\'s liberal traditions (as Cuomo and Kennedy do), or (as Bradley, Nunn and Robb do) a serious challenge to the quasi-isolationist and high-tax positions that have cost the party four out of its last five tries at the White House. Why?  Mr. Schneider correctly points out that Gov. Cuomo, like Sen. Kennedy, is the kind of candidate \"who looks strongest, and therefore has the most power and influence, when he is not running.\" Both realize that, even post-Iranamok, voters will not be shopping for a new Great Society.  And all candidates find the punishing campaign schedules -- what Walter Mondale called \"two years in Holiday Inns\" -- a first-order grind. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona will spend three months of 1987 just in the state of Iowa. An incumbent governor, senator or anyone else with a full-time job can only run for president if he or she becomes an expert in sleep deprivation. There may be reasons why the last candidate to move into the White House directly from an elected office was young Jack Kennedy in 1960.  Lastly, there is the slew of special-interest groups that every Democratic candidate must clamber over. Feminists, labor-union leaders, homosexual groups, social workers and teachers exercise an inordinate amount of influence over the selection of a nominee and the platform that nominee must run on. It is common knowledge that feminist groups pressured Walter Mondale into hastily selecting Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in 1984. Somehow we think Mr. Mondale might have wanted more time to reflect on that decision.  Liberal activist groups have already served notice they will make trouble for any Democrat who deviates from their line. Sen. Bill Bradley\\'s vote in favor of contra aid rendered him de mortuis as far as several were concerned. Journalist William Greider spoke for many liberals this month when he wrote that the Democratic Leadership Council -- a group organized by Sen. Nunn, Mr. Robb and other centrists -- had proposed a defense policy that read \"like it was written by a Rambo with an M.B.A.\"  Democrats claim that after the two Reagan landslides their party learned its lesson and started to move into the mainstream. Maybe yes, maybe no. But party activists who welcome Jesse Jackson, who has embraced both Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega, but turn a cold shoulder to Sen. Nunn (who has moved leftward in their direction on defense of late) have got some explaining to do to the American people. Sen. Nunn says he isn\\'t running, though he\\'s also said he could join the field later. The need for someone to debate the Rev. Jackson head-on should be an added inducement.  Perhaps someone unexpected will enter the 1988 lists. Perhaps candidates will ignore Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk\\'s admonition not to attack each other and some real sparks will fly. We hope so. Otherwise, it is going to be a long spring, summer, fall and winter before the Iowa caucuses convene next Feb. 8. Perhaps by then bored voters will try to draft one of the Missing Democrats into the race. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0129': 'Computer Finds a Role In Buying and Selling, Reshaping Businesses --- Drugstores Check Inventories And Order Automatically, Giving Mckesson an Edge --- How Junkyards Go National --- By David Wessel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> RETAILING (RET) </IN> At Nissenbaum\\'s auto junkyard in Somerville, Mass., someone on the phone is looking for an engine for a 1979 Buick.  Nissenbaum\\'s, which seems to have one of almost everything, doesn\\'t have one of those. So salesman David Butland turns to a nearby personal computer, types a brief message and punches a button that dispatches his request by satellite to 600 other yards across the country.  Three minutes later, a dealer from Dallas offers an engine for $650. Mr. Butland waits. A California dealer offers the same price. He waits. Then someone in Maine -- who can see Mr. Butland\\'s request but not the earlier replies -- offers the same engine for $550. Mr. Butland grabs it and sells it for $700.  \"We\\'ve probably boosted our looking-for-parts business 75% since we got this,\" Mr. Butland says, patting a keyboard that is protected from grimy fingers by a sheet of plastic wrap.  Behold another marketplace that is being transformed by computers.  Computers, of course, are ubiquitous in business today. But most of them are crunching numbers or processing words at ever faster speeds. Now a growing number of companies buy and sell by computer. Industries are changing as a result.  By extending their in-house computer systems into the offices of their customers and suppliers, these companies are creating electronic marketplaces and demonstrating just how fundamentally computers can change the way business is done.  \"These systems in some cases dramatically change the balance of power in buyer-supplier relationships, provide entry and exit barriers, and shift the competitive position of industry rivals,\" says James Cash, a Harvard Business School professor who studies corporate computer use.  For companies that deal in \"recycled auto parts,\" as Nissenbaum\\'s prefers to call them, computers have widened what once was a strictly local market into a national one. To American and United Airlines, the computerized reservation systems they sell to travel agents sometimes seem second in importance only to the planes they fly. To McKesson Corp., a San Francisco wholesaler, computer links to drugstores not only cut costs and increase productivity but also make customers so dependent on McKesson they rarely switch distributors.  Many computer conversations between buyers and sellers, of course, are nothing more than electronic paper-shuffling-faster than the old way but not much different. Dozens of companies boast of the \"competitive advantage\" their computer systems provide. \"This has become a new buzzword\" to get pet computer projects pushed through without the customary cost-benefit analysis, Mr. Cash says.  But these systems can be far more significant, and not just because they are quicker than the mail. \"Faster and cheaper isn\\'t the way to think of this,\" Mr. Cash insists.  Consider the mundane business of restocking shelves at the corner drugstore. Philip Cavavetta buys merchandise for his Boston-area drugstores from two wholesalers. One of them, McKesson, is getting more of his business these days. Why? \"Their computer system is so good,\" he says.  Not long ago, salesmen from McKesson, as those from other wholesalers, would drop by Mr. Cavavetta\\'s Econo Drug Marts to take orders for cough syrup, aspirin, penicillin and Valium. When the store ran short between salesmen\\'s visits, clerks would read new orders over the phone to tape recorders at McKesson\\'s warehouse.  Today, a clerk in Mr. Cavavetta\\'s stores walks the aisles once a week with a McKesson-supplied computer in his palm. If the store is low on, say, bottles of cough syrup, the clerk waves a scanner over a McKesson-provided label stuck to the shelf. The computer takes note, and, when the clerk is finished, transmits the order to McKesson.  At first glance, it appears that McKesson has simply automated a costly, labor-intensive chore. But far more has happened: McKesson\\'s computers not only dispatch the orders to a warehouse but also print price stickers that add in the precise profit margin that Mr. Cavavetta has selected and tell him monthly how profitable each of his departments is.  If Mr. Cavavetta buys from his alternative supplier, a regional wholesaler, he gets none of that. And if he wants to switch to a McKesson competitor with a similar computer service, he will have to relabel his shelves and learn another computer system. \"It\\'s an injection of technological heroin,\" says Mr. Cash.  Other McKesson computer services keep tabs on prescription-drug use by drugstore customers, check to be sure no one is taking medicines that shouldn\\'t be taken simultaneously and bill insurers for subscribers\\' medicines. That is handy for the druggists, of course. But McKesson also earns a small, steady income selling information gleaned from those computers to drug companies and Wall Street.  A decade ago, McKesson\\'s drugstore distribution business was doing so poorly the company considered ditching it. Back then, 800 salesmen sold about $915 million in merchandise to independent drugstores. Last year, 375 salesmen sold $3 billion worth, and drugstore distribution now is McKesson\\'s biggest business. \"Everything we\\'ve been able to do has been driven by getting the customer on computers,\" says Douglas Thompson, a senior vice president in McKesson\\'s drug group.  Not surprisingly, some competitors matched McKesson\\'s computer systems. In what once was a fragmented market, the top four distributors have increased their combined market share substantially to 60%, largely by squeezing out or acquiring small distributors who couldn\\'t keep pace. Big distributors now compete for new accounts by offering increasingly sophisticated computer services. The Foxmeyer unit of National Intergroup Inc., for instance, is about to offer pharmacists personal-computer software that will draw pictures telling them how to rearrange shelves to maximize profits.  But such contests, consultants and others say, are rarely won by deploying more and more sophisticated hardware or software. It isn\\'t building the pipeline that changes an industry. It is what is put through it. Other airlines, for instance, allege that American and United manipulate the information in their computer reservation systems so that their flights show up first on travel agents\\' screens. American and United deny the charges.  Companies in other industries are beginning to push and pull new bits of information through these new pipelines. In Quincy, Mass., Boston Gear, a unit of Incom International Inc., allows the hundreds of small industrial distributors to whom it sells gears to peer into the company\\'s computer to see how much of a given part is in inventory. If the inventory is low, the distributor can see whether other distributors have surpluses they are willing to sell.  In San Francisco, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. soon will begin telling retailers, among other things, how their sales of popular Levi products compare with those of other stores in the same area. \"We hope to give small retailers something to help them manage their business,\" says R.W. Eaton, Levi\\'s vice president for corporate information systems.  In Minneapolis, TCB Inc.\\'s VictorMarsh unit that sells custom coffee mugs to corporations can tell impatient customers where their orders are at any moment. The company\\'s trucker, PIE Nationwide Inc., updates TCB\\'s computers three times a day, giving the location of each shipment and listing any problems.  \"It absolutely blows the customers\\' mind when we call them and tell them we have a problem with their shipment before they know there\\'s a problem,\" says James Wasserman, the executive vice president of TCB.  The electronic marketplace is spreading to so many industries that some companies have no choice but to join in. \"If you\\'re not able to do business this way, you\\'ll be at a competitive disadvantage,\" says John P. Sweeney of General Motors Corp.\\'s Electro-Motive divison.  GM and Ford Motor Co. have indicated that in the future they will do business only with suppliers who can receive and send messages electronically. \"When a customer like GM asks you to do it, you don\\'t have to build a business case for it,\" says Lee Foote, the coordinator of electronic data interchange at Du Pont Co.  The auto companies say they need to cut inventories by arranging for parts to arrive just before they are needed on the assembly line, a cost-saving trick borrowed from the Japanese that requires quick, frequent communication with suppliers. Toward that end, Ford is electronically sending more than 700 suppliers of its Wixom, Mich., assembly plant daily updates on the parts the plant needs. Previously, the information was available only once a week.  The auto industry hasn\\'t enough experience to show how significantly inventories can be reduced, but others do. Levi Strauss, for one, says conversing electronically with denim suppliers has helped the company reduce inventories of uncut fabric to three days\\' worth or less; in the past, the company had enough fabric on hand to make a month\\'s worth of blue jeans. Denim mills tell Levi not only how many rolls of denim are arriving on the next truck but also what shade of fabric is placed where on that truck. \"This translated last year into the largest drop in days of inventory we\\'ve ever had in our history,\" says Thomas Tusher, Levi\\'s executive vice president.  But particularly in an industry like autos, where the big manufacturers have so much clout, suppliers who expect this electronic hand-holding to stop at inventory-reduction efforts may be surprised.  \"It all starts out fairly innocently,\" says David Anderson of Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. \"You want to move toward just-in-time inventory. Then the purchasing department and financial people get in and they want to use the system, too. The next thing you know GM is monitoring supplier costs.\"  Mr. Cash of Harvard adds, \"There is a shortsightedness on the part of the suppliers.\" By reducing the importance of personal contacts and establishing standards for communications, computers \"give the buyer an opportunity to shop across a broader line of suppliers.\" He sees the day when auto makers\\' computers will scan the computers of their primary suppliers and automatically place orders with the one offering the lowest price.  Ford\\'s engine division already is asking suppliers to electronically send statistics describing product quality so that Ford can easily track trends in supplier performance.  Up to now, a Ford spokesman says, the reports arriving on paper have been so voluminous as to be nearly useless. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0128': 'For Stockholders With Some Exceptions --- By Steve Swartz and Bruce Ingersoll Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> The National Association of Securities Dealers proposed a set of uniform voting rights for shareholders that embraces the idea of one-share, one-vote, but with several important exceptions.  The proposal, which NASD Chairman Gordon Macklin sent to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad, comes as legislators and regulators in Washington have been considering enforcing a one-share, one-vote standard across U.S. stock markets.  The NASD\\'s proposal was well-received in Washington. \"It\\'s a very constructive development,\" said Mr. Shad. \"This is wonderful,\" added SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. \"It\\'s an exercise in enlightened self-interest.\"  The voting rights issue came to a head last year when the New York Stock Exchange said it would abandon its one-share, one-vote rule after some of its listed corporations, including General Motors Corp. and Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes this newspaper, created classes of stock with unequal voting rights. Under present Big Board rules, these companies would be forced to list their shares elsewhere.  Big Board officials have testified before the SEC they wanted to retain the one-share, one-vote rule, but would only do so if other markets, including the American Stock Exchange and the NASD, also adopted the rule. The Amex endorsed the proposal, but the NASD, which regulates the over-the-counter market, didn\\'t.  The SEC\\'s favorable reaction indicates that the commission is strongly inclined to approve a uniform one-share, one-vote standard, with significant exemptions. The agency\\'s market regulation staff is already working on a proposal that basically takes the same approach as the NASD\\'s plan, according to SEC officials.  \"Now the issue is, can we and the markets come up with a common standard that we all can agree on?\" said Mr. Grundfest.  Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also commended the NASD\\'s proposal. \"I\\'m pleased the NASD has seen the light and has joined the other major exchanges in advocating a uniform standard that guarantees every shareholder a voice in the governance of corporate America,\" he said.  The reaction on Wall Street, however, was somewhat cooler. Kenneth R. Leibler, president of the Amex, said: \"In concept, certainly it\\'s nice to see the NASD agree to a joint rule, which is something they haven\\'t done before.\" Still, Mr. Leibler said the exemptions proposed by the NASD seemed to be \"so wide I\\'m not sure the rule has real bite.\"  A spokeswoman for the Big Board said its officials haven\\'t seen the NASD proposal and couldn\\'t comment.  Under the NASD proposal, companies that already have dual classes of stock would be protected under a \"grandfather\" clause. In addition, companies would be allowed to issue new shares with limited or no voting rights in cases where all relevant details \"are clearly spelled out to prospective investors in a prospectus.\" The creation of such new classes of stock also would be allowed to facilitate a merger, acquisition or recapitalization, as long as \"the exchange of shares is accompanied by detailed proxy material.\"  Mr. Macklin said the exemptions only cover cases where corporations create new classes of stock with less voting power than existing shares. The creation of so-called \"super\" voting rights, where companies give certain shareholders more voting rights than fellow holders, wouldn\\'t be permitted under the NASD plan. Also, in cases where two voting classes of stock are created, corporations wouldn\\'t be allowed to declare the shares with superior voting rights unsaleable. Such a tactic has been used in recent years to protect management from a hostile takeover.  Most of the listed corporations in the U.S. observe one-share, one-vote. Mr. Leibler said \"the vast majority\" of the Amex\\'s approximately 900 listed companies have equal voting rights for all holders. Mr. Macklin said in his letter to the SEC that about 95% of the approximately 2,700 companies in the NASD\\'s National Market System observe one-share, one-vote. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0127': 'Britain\\'s Alliance Is Offering a Not-So-New Deal --- By Amity Shlaes</HL> David Steel and David Owen, two dark-haired men in two dark-wool suits, march together toward the dais at a rally here. The pair of leaders from Britain\\'s two small center parties, the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, sit on either side of the podium. Then they take turns pitching the middle-of-the-road policies of their parties\\' political partnership, the Alliance. \"The Labor and Tory parties are dancing to the tunes of their own narrow class interests,\" says David Owen and wins applause from a distinctly middle-class audience. \"A caring society, a successful society: The Alliance message is that you can have both.\"  Balancing is proving a successful tactic for Britain\\'s Alliance. The two Davids, as they are known, brought the partnership victory in two of the nation\\'s closely watched recent by-elections. In Truro, which this year is functioning as a kind of Iowa in the British political schedule, the Liberal Party last Thursday won 60.4%, the greatest majority earned by the slender party in the past 40 years. As the end of Margaret Thatcher\\'s second term approaches -- and the likelihood that she\\'ll call an election this year increases -- the Liberal-SDP partnership is exhibiting the clearest profile in Britain it\\'s had since the parties joined hands six years ago.  The Alliance is getting attention because it stands a new chance of breaking a lock on British politics that Labor and Tory parties have held since World War II. A poll printed in the latest London Sunday Times showed the partnership was favored by 25% of the electorate, still behind Labor at 32% and the Conservatives at 41%, but up four percentage points from the month before. Labor\\'s following has been weakened by troubles with trade unions, by its vociferous left wing and by the controversial non-nuclear defense policy of Labor\\'s leader, Neil Kinnock. Mrs. Thatcher still has to explain why under mostly her government unemployment rose to more than three million, or 11.4% of the work force, from some one million in 1975. The Alliance still has to prove that its middle-ground policy -- it advocates a 1980s version of the New Deal to correct unemployment and a closer partnership with the Common Market countries -- can help Britons.  \"What we are talking about is the pace of political change,\" wrote conservative Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, in a column titled \"A Chilling Prospect if the Labour Party Dies.\" \"{It} is beginning to look as if there is a danger of the old Labour order dying before the new Alliance is mature.\"  At the Truro rally voters got a demonstration of the parties\\' seesaw act. To show it wasn\\'t too Thatcherite, the Alliance passed out literature that pointed to the national government subsidies brought home to the Cornish constituency by David Penhaligon, the local Liberal parliamentarian whose death in a car accident last December was the occasion for this by-election. To show it wasn\\'t too radical, the Alliance dropped references to the nation\\'s trade unions as a \"millstone.\" The parties waffled when it came to the controversial subject of Britain\\'s nationalized health system. A dentist in the audience got sympathy, but no concrete suggestions, when he complained he often had to pull teeth -- rather than save them -- because the government wouldn\\'t pay for necessary dental work.  Much of the evening, though, the Alliance found it more useful to attack. David Steel drew cheers with his critique of what he termed the \"yeah-boo,\" politics of Britain\\'s Labor-Tory Parliament. Bigger applause came when he referred to the feuding Labor Party as the \"Beirut of British politics.\" Like leaders of any out-of-power political grouping, Mr. Steel and Dr. Owen worked hard to draw distinction between themselves and the sullied incumbents. The centerpiece in Truro for this strategy was Matthew Taylor, the Alliance\\'s new M.P. A research assistant to the late M.P., Mr. Taylor hasn\\'t had much time to box himself into any political definition: He\\'s 24 years old.  Firmer evidence of what the Alliance could mean for Britain is available in the form of the parties\\' theoretical budget -- which was handed out last week for comparison -- with that delivered yesterday by the chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Like Labor, the Alliance rejected the Tories\\' deficit -- and tax-cutting agenda and concentrated instead on Britain\\'s jobless. The partnership wants to cut Britain\\'s massive unemployment by more than one million in three years -- one year longer than Labor says it would take it to trim unemployment by the same amount.  The Alliance would create jobs with a set of public-works-style measures, and a series of Regional Development Agencies -- read, subsidized businesses -- to create jobs in the public and private sectors. Rather than free businesses, the parties actually want to clamp an additional problem on: a tax to control the top limit of what an employer chooses to pay. Tax cuts were the subject of scorn in a speech by the Liberals\\' Mr. Steel, who asked \"What is the point of another tuppence off at the end of the tax if it means my son or nephew is on the end of the dole {line}?\"  When it adopts such postures, the Alliance shows itself true to some of British liberalism\\'s traditions. The budget document, for example, reflects the same demand-side focus and sets of public-works-style measures that were part of the British budgets nearly 60 years ago, when the British treasury was controlled by another pair of Liberals: David Lloyd George and John Maynard Keynes. But the document also shows how far the Liberal Party has strayed from the laissez-faire definition of economic liberalism valued by many Americans and created in Scotland and England. The Alliance has opted for the 20th-century style of liberalism, no matter how far it seems to stray from even the Liberals\\' own party constitution, which \"in all spheres . . . sets freedom first.\"  In part, the Liberals\\' two faces reflect a conflict that\\'s present in most of Western Europe\\'s other, divided, liberal parties. West Germany\\'s Free Democrats, for example, remain a thin -- if pivotal --party in large part because most Germans see their willingness to form coalitions with parties at both ends of the political spectrum as opportunistic, if not hypocritical. Parties such as the ecological Greens -- which have sprung up in some form from Britain to Austria -- are easier for many to understand and support. The Social Democrats -- the second partner in the Alliance -- have a clearer heritage in European politics.  By-elections -- the strongest evidence for the Alliance\\'s new strength -- are notoriously unreliable indicators. Much of the Alliance\\'s victory in Truro, for example, can be credited to the personal popularity of the M.P. who preceded the new victor. The 41% Mrs. Thatcher\\'s party currently holds means she will likely enjoy a third term. Moreover, Britons across the political spectrum fear that a realignment of the British political constellation would deprive Britain\\'s poor and its workers of any political voice.  Still, action in the constituencies indicates many voters have hopes for the group\\'s yellow-and-black banner. Said one women who traveled to Truro to support the Alliance: \"I\\'m tired of my town. They always vote conservative. They\\'d elect a gorilla if it had a blue ribbon around its neck.\"  --- Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. ',\n",

A spokesman for the Braunschweig state prosecutor\\'s office, Carl Retemeyer, said investigators want to speak with Joachim Schmidt, senior partner in the Joachim Schmidt &amp; Partner KG foreign-exchange firm. The spokesman said Mr. Schmidt is currently believed to be traveling outside of West Germany.  \"The prosecuting attorneys have some questions to ask Mr. Schmidt,\" Mr. Retemeyer said, but he declined to elaborate. \"All I can say is that we want to speak to him in connection with the VW investigation.\"  An associate at Mr. Schmidt\\'s Frankfurt office said Mr. Schmidt could return to Frankfurt \"any time.\" The associate declined to give his name.  VW last week reported that \"criminal manipulation\" in its foreign-exchange positions cost it as much as $259 million. The fraud has led to the resignation of its chief financial officer and the ouster of its foreign-exchange manager.  Mr. Retemeyer said the fraud inquiry is still focusing on the possible involvement of employees at the West German auto maker. But he said the fraud could have been achieved in collaboration with people outside the company, possibly in Frankfurt.  An investigating team of Braunschweig state attorneys, assisted by Frankfurt prosecutors and Federal Crime Bureau officials, have so far served no indictments in the week-old case.  Frankfurt foreign-exchange traders describe the Schmidt firm as a small operation on the periphery of the large Frankfurt foreign-exchange market, which is dominated by large West German and foreign banks.  Mr. Schmidt was linked to the VW case by Burkhard Junger, VW\\'s former foreign-exchange manager who was summarily dismissed by VW last Friday. Mr. Junger, who has denied any wrongdoing in the matter, was quoted by Der Spiegel magazine as having made unspecified allegations that either the Hungarian National Bank or Schmidt &amp; Partner were involved in the questionable deals with Volkswagen.  The Hungarian National Bank has confirmed earlier reports that its name was used on forged documents apparently connected to the suspected fraud. The bank has also helped identify falsified documents presented to it by VW. The bank said that it has done nothing wrong and that it has offered to assist VW in the investigation.  Separately, it was disclosed that a well-known Frankfurt attorney last month told VW that he possessed a letter in which an unidentified client had admitted to involvement in a case of currency fraud at VW. The lawyer, Egon Geis, was quoted as saying his client had also offered to cooperate in any investigation. Mr. Geis wasn\\'t in his office yesterday and was unavailable for comment.  Reading from a statement, VW spokesman Peter Schlelein said Mr. Geis told VW of the letter\\'s existence by telephone. And on Feb. 24, Mr. Geis met with VW\\'s chairman, Carl Hahn, as well as other VW executives.  \"Against expectations, and in contrast to the telephone conversation (with Mr. Geis) the day before, Mr. Geis didn\\'t bring with him the letter of his client,\" Mr. Schlelein said. \"His explanation was that he was no longer authorized to name his client, and that he had received different instructions in the meantime.\"  Since then, VW has had no further contact with Mr. Geis. VW, meanwhile, has refered the matter to state attorneys investigating the case. Mr. Schlelein added that VW is still unaware of the identity of the Frankfurt attorney\\'s client. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0119': 'Japan Economy Expanded 0.8% In 4th Quarter --- Growth in GNP During \\'86 Was Slowest in 12 Years, Amounting to Only 2.5% --- Special to The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN> Japan\\'s economy grew an inflation-adjusted 0.8% in 1986\\'s fourth quarter from the prior three months, faster than the third quarter\\'s 0.7% expansion, the Economic Planning Agency said.  The growth in gross national product during the calendar fourth quarter, which is the third quarter of Japan\\'s fiscal year, amounted to 3.2% at an annual rate. The fourth-quarter expansion brought GNP growth for all of 1986 to only 2.5%, the slowest expansion in 12 years and down from 1985\\'s 4.7% increase.  With the release of the statistics, the government\\'s growth target for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, continued to remain in question. The current target is 3%, down from the 4% originally set. But Japanese economists have said that even the 3% target can\\'t be met.  Economists said yesterday that the economy would have to expand 2.6%, or at a 10.8% annual rate, in the current quarter if GNP growth in the full fiscal year is to reach 3%.  At the planning agency, economists said it was difficult to determine from the latest data whether the economy can expand 3% in the fiscal year. \"We have to see what kind of figures we will come up with in the January-March quarter,\" one of them said.  Susumu Taketomi, senior economist at Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., said growth in 1986\\'s fourth quarter was slightly faster than the bank had expected. Nonetheless, he said that although growth in the current fiscal year may be higher than the 2% that Industrial Bank has predicted, it will be difficult to achieve a 3% expansion.  Japan\\'s export-driven economy has been hurt by the strong yen, which has raised the cost of the nation\\'s products on foreign markets. The currency\\'s strength has eaten into corporate sales and earnings and has caused many of the nation\\'s exporters to curtail production and employment.  In 1986\\'s first quarter, the economy contracted for the first time in 11 years. It grew 0.9% in the year\\'s second quarter. The 0.7% expansion in the calendar year\\'s third quarter marked an upward revision from the 0.6% reported in December.  For the fiscal year starting April 1, the government has predicted growth of 3.5% in the belief that the impact of the yen\\'s strength will dissipate. On Monday, the Finance Ministry released a survey showing that Japanese companies expect business to start rebounding in 1987\\'s second quarter.  The latest GNP report came amid continuing calls from Japan\\'s trading partners, especially the U.S., that the Tokyo government do more to spur domestic demand in order to help reduce its huge trade surplus.  At a meeting of finance ministers in Paris last month, Japan pledged to draft a new economic-stimulus package as soon as parliament finishes work on the budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1. Although analysts have predicted that the measures in the package won\\'t be sufficient, officials in Washington have said that the fact that Japan even agreed to introduce the package is significant in itself.  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said yesterday that Japan is taking steps that should help the U.S. trade position, although further action is still required.  The stimulative package is expected to include stepped-up spending on public works and a relaxation of regulations on industry in order to encourage production. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was reported this week to have indicated that the government may introduce an additional package in the fall.  In the 1986 fourth quarter, the planning agency said, domestic demand accounted for 0.5 percentage point of the 0.8% economic growth. Mr. Taketomi of Industrial Bank said the statistics illustrated the attempts the government already has made to make the economy more dependent on domestic demand for expansion.  Personal spending, which accounts for nearly 60% of Japanese GNP, fell 0.7% in the quarter from the previous three months, the first decline in 12 years. But Mr. Taketomi ascribed the drop to technical factors, and planning agency officials noted that unusually warm weather caused Japanese residents to spend less on winter clothing and heaters and made electricity consumption unusually low. Winter bonus payments were also sluggish, they said.  (Revised WSJ March 19, 1987)',\n",

Although Mr. Lawson announced a widely expected cut in the standard rate of income tax, to 27% from 29%, the rest of his budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 was short on pre-election giveaways.  Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, scorned the budget for having \"little to do with the general good and everything to do with the general election\" expected later this year. But analysts in the City, London\\'s financial district, disagreed. They said Mr. Lawson\\'s cautious approach put no economic pressure on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to call an early general election.  Instead, she will be able to judge how voters react to the budget and the generally expected interest-rate cuts and should be free to set the election date in light of opinion polls and other political developments.  London share prices and the British pound responded favorably to the introduction of the budget yesterday, with sterling surging more than 1% against major currencies.  Buoyant tax revenue gave Mr. Lawson perhaps more leeway to cut taxes, reduce the government\\'s deficit or increase public spending than any British chancellor since World War II. But he resisted the temptation to fulfill his long-held ambition of cutting the basic income-tax rate to 25%.  Although Mr. Lawson considers himself a tax reformer, he passed up the opportunity to simplify the tax code. He also disappointed those who urged him to take specific measures to reduce unemployment and increase pensions. Instead, the chancellor chose to slash the government\\'s borrowing requirement next year.  A 25% basic tax rate remains his \"firm objective,\" Mr. Lawson said. \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\"  He accordingly surprised the City by targeting a deficit for the next fiscal year that is currently equivalent to $6.4 billion, or about 1% of gross domestic product, down from the $11.2 billion previously envisaged.  The $4.8 billion planned cut in the deficit compared with tax-cutting measures of about $4 billion. The deficit \"is lower than anybody dared hope for,\" said Ian Harwood, an economist at the stockbrokerage Warburg Securities.  Mr. Harwood forecast that the budget will be followed by a reduction in British banks\\' base rates today from the 10.5% that was set last week. But City economists couldn\\'t agree on the likely scale of the in-rate cut.  Mr. Harwood said base rates could be cut one percentage point. Peter Fellner, the government bond and monetary economist at another brokerage, James Capel &amp; Co., predicted only a half-point cut today, with a further half-point reduction depending on how sterling reacts to the budget. At Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Ltd., chief economist Mike Osborne said he expects \"an immediate one percentage point off interest rates, and base rates of 8.5% by May.\"  Lower interest rates could help the average voter -- and, by extension, the Conservative government\\'s reelection chances -- as much as tax cuts. Some 63% of British households own their own homes, most financed with flexible-rate mortgages. Although base rates fell by half a percentage point last week, Britain\\'s building societies held back from cutting their mortgage rates from the present level of around 12.25%.  But further base-rate cuts should now trigger a drop in home-loan rates, said Brian Whitfield, a general manager at Nationwide Building Society, Britain\\'s third-largest savings and loan association.  Lower interest rates play an important part in the government\\'s counter-inflationary strategy because mortgage rates are part of Britain\\'s retail-price index. In a potentially popular move that is also likely to knock an estimated 0.3% off the annual inflation rate, the chancellor said he won\\'t increase excise duties on beer, wine, spirits and tobacco. Usually, duties on these products increase each year in line with the retail-price index.  But there were few populist measures elsewhere in the budget. Mr. Lawson did nothing to take low-paid workers off the tax rolls. Instead, he increased the tax-free allowances by no more than last year\\'s 3.7% inflation rate.  Mr. Lawson made no major changes to company taxes -- leaving the corporation tax unchanged at 35% in fiscal 1988. He also left the basic rate of value-added tax unchanged at 15%.  But he did introduce a number of detailed measures to ease the burden of value-added tax on small businesses. He also reduced the rate of corporation tax levied on small businesses to 27% from 29% in line with the new standard income tax level.  Mr. Lawson said Britain is entering its \"seventh successive year of steady growth, and the fifth in which this has been combined with low inflation.\"  He forecast that gross domestic product will rise an inflation-adjusted 3% during the 1987 calendar year after a 2.5% gain in 1986, adding that there is \"every prospect\" of unemployment\\'s falling throughout the year from its current seasonally adjusted level of 3.1 million.  The chancellor said exports are increasing because of last year\\'s sharp fall in the pound. But he forecast a widening of the deficit on the current account -- which tallies Britain\\'s trade in goods, services and certain unilateral transfers -- to about $4 billion this year from $1.6 billion in 1986. The Treasury believes that the current-account deficit will narrow to an annual rate of $3.2 billion in the first half of 1988.  \"The significance of this should not be exaggerated,\" Mr. Lawson said. He said the projected current-account deficit will amount to only 0.5% of GDP, while Britain\\'s net overseas assets stand at more than $160.2 billion -- their highest level since World War II.  The chancellor conceded that the annual inflation rate, which stood at 3.5% at the end of last year, will likely advance in the coming months and perhaps exceed 4.5% in the summer. But he predicted that inflation should fall to 4% by year\\'s end.  Concern about inflation may explain why Mr. Lawson decided against a pre-election giveaway budget. \"He\\'s obviously worried about overheating in the economy and has been excessively cautious in view of the current account and inflation trends,\" Kleinwort Grieveson\\'s Mr. Osborne said. \"In fact this is a Lawson budget, not a Thatcher budget,\" he concluded.

Although the initial surge after the budget prompted some profit-taking, the outlook for the near future remains positive, Mr. Williams said.  The stock market\\'s advance paralleled a surge in British government bonds, which gained as much as 1 5/8 points on the day. The pound was also firmer against the dollar and mark.  Trading remained moderate prior to the budget\\'s announcement, but the market advanced throughout the day.

There was also \"some buying\" both from domestic and overseas institutions, a dealer at a British market-making firm said.

Investor sentiment is \"cautiously bullish,\" traders said, although some predicted more touch-and-go movement by the market barometers as investors react to performances by overseas exchanges, foreign currency developments and other factors.  Buying gradually increased throughout the day as investors focused on steel, heavy industrial, railway, construction and securities issues, traders said. The bullishness was fueled by increased buying and selling by Japanese tokkin funds, many of which are preparing for valuations March 20. Tokkin funds are similar to U.S. mutual funds.  Activity of advancing steel issues such as Nippon Steel and Kawasaki Steel accounted for a large share of the high turnover. Securities firms are hawking steelmakers as good long-term investments because of industrywide restructuring plans.  Some construction issues rose on renewed optimism about Japanese government plans to stimulate the economy.  Brokerage houses such as Nomura gained on improved business prospects in the wake of continuing high volume on the Tokyo stock exchange. Banking stocks rose modestly on bargain-hunting.

       " 'WSJ870318-0113': 'Of Independent Counsel to Indict Deaver --- By Stephen Wermiel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> A federal appeals court refused to delay any longer an independent counsel\\'s plans to ask a grand jury to indict former White House aide Michael Deaver on perjury charges.  In a one-page order, the three-judge court wiped out the stay it issued last Thursday and ordered a federal district judge to dismiss Mr. Deaver\\'s challenge to the constitutionality of the independent-counsel law.  Mr. Deaver\\'s lawyers yesterday rushed to the Supreme Court in hopes of obtaining an emergency order to stop independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. from seeking grand jury indictments against Mr. Deaver.  It isn\\'t clear when the Supreme Court will act on the matter, or when Mr. Seymour intends to go to the grand jury.  Mr. Seymour has said he will ask a grand jury to charge Mr. Deaver, former deputy White House chief of staff and a longtime friend of President and Mrs. Reagan, with four counts of perjury.  Mr. Seymour was appointed by a special court last May to investigate possible conflicts-of-interest by Mr. Deaver in his lobbying efforts after he left the White House. Mr. Seymour\\'s case against Mr. Deaver alleges that he lied to the grand jury and to a House subcommittee.  Mr. Deaver last month filed a lawsuit arguing that court-appointed independent counsels violate the Constitution\\'s separation-of-powers doctrine because they exercise prosecutorial authority usually reserved for people appointed by the president. Lawyers for Mr. Deaver have twice obtained temporary delays of possible grand jury action while a federal district judge, and then the appeals court, considered the case.  In both instances, the judges have concluded that federal courts shouldn\\'t interfere with pending criminal investigations, especially before charges have even been filed.  Yesterday, the appeals court said Mr. Deaver\\'s case \"constitutes an impermissible pre-emptive civil challenge to a criminal proceeding.\"  The appeals court didn\\'t rule on the law\\'s constitutionality, and Mr. Deaver\\'s lawyers may raise the same arguments again in another lawsuit, if and when Mr. Deaver is ever indicted.  The ruling yesterday was issued by Judges Laurence Silberman, Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsburg.  A similar lawsuit challenging the independent-counsel law, filed by lawyers for former National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North, was dismissed last week by a federal judge who also ruled that the case was premature. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0112': 'To Consider Steps To Impeach Judge --- By Stephen Wermiel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The U.S. Judicial Conference recommended that the House consider initiating impeachment proceedings against Alcee Hastings, a federal judge in Miami who was acquitted of bribery charges four years ago.  The conference formally notified House leaders, using provisions spelled out in a federal judicial misconduct law, \"that consideration of impeachment may be warranted.\" The 27-judge conference is the supervisory body of the federal judiciary. The matter came to the conference on a complaint by other federal judges.  The conference\\'s action will trigger an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee to decide whether charges of impeachment should be brought against Judge Hastings, who was acquitted in 1983 of charges that he solicited a bribe.  Yesterday, the committee chairman, Rep. Peter Rodino (D., N.J.), said in a statement, \"We will carefully investigate and review the matter to determine whether impeachment proceedings should be undertaken by the House. . . .\"  The case is highly controversial because Judge Hastings is accused by his fellow judges of misconduct but has never been convicted of a crime. Under a 1980 federal judicial misconduct law, the complaint prompted an investigation by a special committee of the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which encompasses Florida.  The appeals court investigation has never been officially made public, but published accounts of the report say the investigative committee concluded that Judge Hastings allegedly perjured himself in the bribery trial.  Yesterday, the Judicial Conference, presided over by Supreme Chief Justice William Rehnquist, passed on the appeals court\\'s 381-page report to the House.  Terence Anderson, Judge Hastings\\'s lawyer, said later that the case against the judge is \"warmed-over circumstantial evidence\" and predicted that there won\\'t be an impeachment.  Judge Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida, continues to serve, and is being assigned cases. A spokesman for the Judicial Conference said the Atlanta-based appeals court \"may consider\" removing Judge Hastings from active duty.  Last year, the House impeached and the Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne, who was found guilty in federal court of tax evasion. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0111': 'For Tina Brown, Progress at Vanity Fair --- By Laura Landro Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> When Tina Brown took over as editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc.\\'s Vanity Fair magazine three years ago -- its third editor since its 1983 debut -- the floundering magazine was, in her words, the \"laughingstock\" of the publishing industry.  But since Ms. Brown arrived, circulation has nearly doubled to more than 400,000 copies monthly. Last month, Adweek magazine placed Vanity Fair at the top of its \"Ten Hottest\" magazines of 1986. In a year when many consumer magazines had declines in advertising revenue and pages, Vanity Fair\\'s advertising sales rose 69.7% and the number of advertising pages increased 38.6%.  \"With publisher Douglas Johnston and his staff aggressively selling the cachet of Tina Brown\\'s editorial product, (Vanity Fair) looks to be securing its grip on a lucrative niche,\" observed Adweek.  Both Mr. Johnston and S.I. Newhouse, whose closely held publishing empire includes Conde Nast, credit Ms. Brown with turning around a magazine many in publishing expected to fold shortly after she arrived. \"We were baffled, struggling to get the right combination of people, editorial and circulation philosophy,\" says Mr. Newhouse. \"Vanity Fair was waiting for the right editor, and from the time she came in it was clear she was capable of taking the Vanity Fair idea and updating and restating it.\"  Ms. Brown\\'s editorial product, he adds, \"is much closer to what I had in mind\" when he decided to relaunch the legendary monthly as a new publication. Vanity Fair had flourished between 1914 and 1936 as the bible of the rich, literary and sophisticated, but was folded into Conde Nast\\'s Vogue magazine. The relaunch was among the most ballyhooed publishing debuts of the decade. Mr. Johnston, the publisher, says advertisers lined up to get in the first issue. \"We expected 50 to 55 pages of advertising and got 168,\" he says. \"It was like fantasy land.\"  But the fantasy soon turned sour. Advertisers balked at the ponderous, stilted editorial style of the magazine; critics say its first editor, Richard Locke, tended to feature lengthy, intellectual stories and arty but incomprehensible photo essays. A second editor didn\\'t help things much; by July 1984, three months after Ms. Brown arrived, Mr. Johnston says advertisers were so disgusted that the magazine carried only 14 pages of advertising. \"We just lost all credibility,\" he says.  Vanity Fair has regained much of its credibility with both advertisers and subscribers, as is apparent from its impressive sales and page gains. Those gains are heavily weighted in the cosmetic and fashion categories; Mr. Johnston acknowledges the magazine has had trouble attracting the more staid corporate advertisers it seeks.  Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, says that he expects seven to eight years of losses in total at Vanity Fair, \"but it\\'s now possible to find a time in the future where we can make Vanity Fair into a self-sustaining publication.\" Mr. Newhouse says the magazine will carry about 700 pages of advertising this year, and it needs about 1,000 pages per year \"before it can hold its own.\" But he says the growth in circulation and the \"growing awareness of the magazine\" under Ms. Brown\\'s reign should help Vanity Fair meet his goals.  Ms. Brown caught Mr. Newhouse\\'s eye as editor of London\\'s sassy, irreverent Tatler magazine, which Conde Nast purchased in 1982. Initially acting as a consultant to Vanity Fair, she says she found early issues \"pretentious and intellectual, and visually a zoo.\" She acknowledges that many of the magazine\\'s pieces were good, but were so long that \"nobody wanted to wade through them,\" and there were almost no short features to lighten the magazine.  After becoming editor, Ms. Brown quickly overhauled the magazine, buffering essay-length pieces with short, gossipy pieces looking at \"the more vulgar elements of popular culture in a tongue-in-cheek way,\" aiming at readers she describes as \"the goers out, the first nighters, the hot-cutting edge people.\" Critics assailed the new Vanity Fair as superficial and celebrity-oriented; one skeptic called it \"a People magazine for people who read,\" recalls the publisher, Mr. Johnston.  On the editorial side, Ms. Brown scored such coups as getting the Reagans to pose for a black-tie photo session, including a cover picture of the dancing couple kicking up their heels. She has also stirred up controversy with such pieces as her own critical jab at the Princess of Wales as a shrewish, self-absorbed \"Mouse that Roared.\" Ms. Brown likes to hobnob with the literati and other celebrities herself, and acknowledges that Vanity Fair often interferes with her own social relationships. After a scathing review of Washington reporter-turned-hostess Sally Quinn\\'s novel \"Regrets Only,\" Ms. Brown says Ms. Quinn sent her a note by express mail disinviting her to a coming party, \"and we\\'ve never spoken since.\"  More recently, the magazine has won attention for such articles as this month\\'s essay on the decimating effect of acquired immune deficiency syndrome on the world of fashion and the arts. Ms. Brown decided to run photos of 50 men and women in those fields who had died of the disease, including several whose families hadn\\'t previously acknowledged it. Geoffrey Stokes, media critic for the Village Voice and a frequent critic of Vanity Fair, grudgingly called the piece both \"tasteful and important,\" though he noted those \"are not terms usually used in connection with Tina Brown.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0110': '--- Mom-and-Pop Stores, Wholesalers Who Supply Them Fall Out of Favor --- By Christopher J. Chipello Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> RETAILING (RET) </IN> In the shopping arcade next to a train station in Tokyo\\'s upper-middle-class Meguro ward, Yoshiyuki Abe and his wife operate the Japanese equivalent of a delicatessen. Wielding chopsticks, they insert pieces of marinated meat, fish and vegetables into takeout boxes.  The couple\\'s teen-age sons help part time, as does their grandmother. But while the sons lend a hand, their friends scoff at the thought of working in such a place, says Mr. Abe, rubbing a hand over his shaved head.  The Abes are fortunate. Three other shops in the arcade have shut down this year because the owners\\' sons didn\\'t want to help keep them going. \"It\\'s got everyone around here talking,\" Mr. Abe says.  What\\'s happening in his neighborhood is no isolated event. Throughout Japan, small businesses like Mr. Abe\\'s -- the mom-and-pop stores that once dominated retailing -- are losing their clout.  Emerging in their place are convenience stores and chains specializing in everything from shoes to audio equipment. At the same time, department stores and supermarkets are stepping up efforts to sell their own brands directly. Manufacturers, too, are moving to establish their own marketing channels.  As a result, wholesalers are being squeezed, and some are scrambling to find new roles in a changing system.  \"A vast restructuring of the Japanese retail industry is under way,\" says a recent report by Salomon Brothers Inc. Adds Yoshihiro Tajima, president of the Distribution Economics Institute of Japan, \"The basic picture is changing.\"  A shifting distribution structure ultimately could help restrain Japan\\'s notoriously high prices. It will certainly offer consumers more choice. And the move by some big Japanese companies to set up wholesale importing operations may even help foreigners crack the world\\'s second-largest consumer market.  But the changes are bad news for the hundreds of thousands of people who run Japan\\'s candy stores, vegetable stands, fresh-fish outlets and other small shops.  After decades of uninterrupted growth, the number of stores run by individuals stagnated between 1976 and 1982, and declined by 8% from 1982 to 1985, the latest year for which figures are available. Corporate-run stores in the most recent four-year period increased by 35%.  \"The small-scale traditional type of stores are disappearing,\" says Mr. Tajima, of the economics institute, making it likely that \"the wholesalers who supply them will also disappear.\"  The forces behind these changes range from a new breed of fashion-conscious Japanese consumers to the strong yen. Computerized check-out systems and data networks linking retailers with suppliers are pushing the process along. The government\\'s proposed 5% value-added tax -- if it survives the storm of criticism it has generated -- could accelerate these trends.  Japan\\'s sprint from deprivation to affluence has altered personal values and tastes. Young Japanese are less interested in taking over the family business and squirreling away money than they are in working for prestigious companies and skiing on weekends. Buying habits have shifted, forcing retailers to adjust or be left behind.  The three defunct shops near the train station fell victims to what Mr. Tajima calls the \"bubble effect.\" As Japan rebuilt itself helter-skelter on the rubble of World War II, people returning from China and Korea made a living peddling goods on the streets, moving to indoor premises when they had saved enough. With the economy rising fast through the early 1970s, there was enough new business to accommodate big and little retailers alike. But since the mid-1970s, the surge in oil prices and other factors have made Japan\\'s double-digit growth a thing of the past.  \"The bubble became bigger and bigger,\" says Mr. Tajima. \"But now it\\'s finished.\"  Of Japan\\'s 1.3 million small shops, industry analysts say, the ones that specialize stand the best chance of surviving.  Take Kojima Denki, a small electronics shop across the street from the Abes\\' establishment. Two years ago the store was a typical neighborhood \"denkiya,\" a household-appliances shop crammed with everything from televisions to washing machines. Today, disco music spills out of the store, and the shelves are filled with videotapes, pocket radios, floppy disks and a few compact blow-dryers.  A gray-haired employee who has spent much of the past 25 years making house calls on regular customers sits these days behind a partition keeping the books. Targeting the \"shinjinrui\" -- literally, the \"new humankind,\" as Tokyo\\'s upwardly mobile trendies are known -- has paid off, he says. For small retailers, \"It\\'s hard to get by anymore being a we\\'ve-got-it-all shop.\"  Seven-Eleven Japan Co. has it all -- or so it might seem. Thirteen years after the first Japanese Seven-Eleven opened for business, under an agreement with Southland Corp. of the U.S., some 3,000 of the convenience stores, with their orange, green and red trim, dot the country\\'s urban neighborhoods and rural highways.  In 1983, Seven-Eleven became the first Japanese retail chain to introduce computerized check-out systems in all its outlets. It also pioneered a system in which suppliers pool their deliveries to outlets. Before this so-called vendor system was introduced, \"it was unthinkable to put one maker\\'s goods on another\\'s trucks,\" says Yoshinobu Naito, spokesman for Ito Yokado Co., which owns 51% of publicly traded Seven-Eleven Japan.  The strong yen is also encouraging retailers to go bargain hunting overseas. Last September, for instance, Korean-assembled rolls of Fuji Photo Film Co. film began showing up on the shelves of a major superstore chain. The retailer\\'s representative in Seoul had discovered that exchange-rate shifts made it possible to repatriate the film and still undercut the standard Japanese price.  The 5% value-added tax before Japan\\'s parliament could speed consolidation of the distribution industry. Despite exemptions for 51 product categories and measures to insulate small businesses from the proposed levy, many small operations will be hit hard, analysts believe. \"We expect the small middleman to virtually disappear,\" writes Salomon\\'s Ms. Nara.

       " 'WSJ870318-0109': 'First Jersey\\'s Plan To Settle Lawsuit --- By William Power Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> Maine\\'s attorney general, pursuing the state\\'s own suit against First Jersey Securities Inc., is trying to hold up the firm\\'s proposed $10 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by current and former customers.  First Jersey, a New York-based investment firm that recently sold its retail brokerage offices, agreed in January to pay the money to settle customers\\' claims that they paid excessive prices for stocks. The settlement, in which First Jersey didn\\'t admit wrongdoing, is subject to a public hearing scheduled for March 27 in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.  Maine has a separate lawsuit pending against First Jersey that accuses the firm of selling unregistered securities in the state. It seeks an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of Maine customers of the firm.  In an objection to the class-action settlement, filed with U.S. District Judge Charles R. Weiner, Maine accused First Jersey of deliberately mixing up company records to conceal the names of Maine customers who may also benefit from the state\\'s suit. State officials claim that the settlement could deprive Maine investors of the chance to collect larger payments in state court. They also claim the firm didn\\'t fully inform Maine customers of the implications of the settlement.  Peter J. Brann, an assistant attorney general handling the case, said yesterday that he inspected \"a whole bunch of documents\" at First Jersey headquarters last week as part of the state\\'s suit. He said in reviewing computer printouts, it was difficult to sort out the Maine customers. He also said in the objection that some names of known Maine customers were missing.  Maine also is objecting to the settlement as inadequate.  Both First Jersey and lawyers for the suing customers criticized Maine\\'s objections, which they said nonetheless shouldn\\'t delay the settlement. Leonard Barrack, an attorney for First Jersey in Philadelphia, called Maine\\'s objections \"total nonsense\" and added that Mr. Brann was \"probably looking for a headline.\"  Robert E. Brennan, First Jersey\\'s founder and owner and a defendant in the class action, said yesterday that his firm cooperated with Maine over the past year and that the state\\'s position is \"ridiculous.\" He accused Maine officials of trying to \"create a crisis atmosphere, which of course suits their real intent . . . to try to get some publicity for their department.\"  David Berger, an attorney in Philadelphia who negotiated the $10 million settlement for the suing customers, said he\\'s \"not concerned\" about Maine\\'s objection. \"We don\\'t think the state of Maine has any standing whatsoever\" in the settlement, he added. A handful of customers in the class action also have objected to the settlement.  Of 350,000 notices mailed to First Jersey customers about the settlement, fewer than 50 were to Maine, lawyers involved in the case said.  About 30,000 current and former customers -- those who bought about 40 different securities from Oct. 1, 1980, to Sept. 30, 1986 -- are eligible for part of the $10 million. Mr. Berger, whose law firm had to set up a special phone number just to handle First Jersey customers\\' queries, said he expects about 50% of the eligible customers to file claims on the money, a high percentage for a class-action settlement, he said.

       " 'WSJ870318-0108': 'In Effort to Reduce Large Fraud Losses --- By Cynthia F. Mitchell Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> In the dark of night, a group of midwestern housewives pulled off an elaborate theft. They drove to selected garbage dumpsters to pull out bags of trash that could be converted into $10,000 in cash.  The trash? Proofs of purchase and sales receipts that had been turned in for consumer-product rebates -- and already paid. The women resubmitted thousands of the rebates and camouflaged their trail by varying their names and using postal boxes all over the country.  Consumer-products companies say they are losing millions of dollars a year to such schemes -- and to much less elaborate ones. Of the more than $1 billion a year estimated to be paid out in refunds and rebates, nobody knows exactly how big a chunk is paid to people who never bought the product or who are violating the standard one-refund-a-household restriction. But everybody agrees that the problem is too big to ignore.  Indeed, after long viewing rebate fraud as an inevitable cost of doing business, marketers are seeking ways to cut their losses. To protect themselves, several clearinghouses -- the third-parties that handle the paperwork on most mass rebate offers -- now shred or burn processed rebate submissions. They use computer programs that track suspect names and sound bells when they spot duplicate requests. For their part, marketers are tightening up rebate rules and making proofs of purchase harder to forge or steal off store shelves.  \"We can\\'t afford to keep getting burned,\" says Frank Shaw, an executive vice president of Coleman Co., a Wichita, Kan., camping-gear maker whose annual rebate program is being slashed about 30% this year because of suspected fraud.  In Minnesota, postal-fraud investigators in 1985 jailed a man who had swindled companies out of at least $20,000 by stealing proofs of purchase from stores and replicating receipts with a stolen credit-card machine. In Kansas, also in 1985, three women who submitted hundreds of rebates with forged receipts -- reading \"Thank you for shopping at K mart\" -- were caught after they tried to make claims on a floor-wax company that didn\\'t sell products to the big discount chain.  And in Michigan, sources say that postal investigators are on the verge of cracking what the investigators believe is the biggest rebate fraud yet.  But more often individuals bent on getting something for nothing get away with rebate fraud. Even though the problem is getting more attention, many companies are loath to bite the hand that feeds them by prosecuting consumers. It is also tough to get prosecutors interested. \"They aren\\'t really sexy cases,\" admits Neil Schorr, a U.S. Postal Service inspector.  Those who are caught usually escape severe punishment. In the Midwestern trash-theft scheme the ringleader -- who pleaded guilty to mail fraud and using false names -- was sentenced last month, in federal court in Chicago, to three years\\' probation with 10 hours a week of community service. She also has to repay $20,000 she was accused of making. Though prosecutors couldn\\'t prove the ring got more than $52,000, companies and clearinghouses estimate their total potential losses from this scheme in the six-figure range. (The victims think the ring sold or traded thousands of sets of stolen rebate papers to others who also stood to profit.)  Some companies decline to discuss their misredemption problems, for fear of tipping off would-be criminals or offending honest customers. Clearinghouses and postal authorities say some companies even balk at printing warnings on redemption forms that mail fraud is a federal crime.  Others are more candid, but not necessarily more eager to prosecute. General Electric Co.\\'s lighting group a few months ago discovered counterfeit proofs of purchase submitted for an auto-headlight rebate. It also had problems with employee theft of packing materials -- including proof-of-purchase forms -- from warehouses. And last year, a clearinghouse discovered that a Florida man had bilked GE of $2,500 by using varied names and addresses to submit 400 rebate claims.  GE concedes it filed no charges. \"We just feel, from a PR view, that we\\'d never win, even though you could win handsdown in court,\" a spokesman says. \"We just don\\'t want the publicity of jumping on a consumer no matter what he did.\" Instead, GE\\'s clearinghouse filed in its computer the names of people suspected of abusing the rebate system; any further claims by those people will be studied carefully rather than paid routinely.  While no marketer seems immune to fraud perpetrated with forged or stolen proofs of purchase, some rebates -- such as those for products that aren\\'t boxed and don\\'t have labels -- are easier targets. \"When the requirement is simply to copy the number off of a can -- boy, it\\'s hose time,\" says Robert Zwhalan, an executive with ACS Marketing Services Inc., a Beaverton, Ore., clearinghouse. Promotion Watch Inc., a Farmington Hills, Mich., promotion-security firm, has advised clients to attach adhesive proof-of-purchase stickers to vulnerable products. Then, at least, the number of rebate claims can\\'t exceed the number of stickers.  Windmere Corp., a Hialeah, Fla., maker of personal-care products, decided it would make its proofs of purchase harder to get. It moved the universal product codes to the center of its curling-iron boxes from the end flaps, for example, after discovering that most of the flaps on boxes still in stores had been ripped off.  \"We\\'re trying to make it a little tougher for even the small-time crooks,\" says David Friedson, Windmere\\'s president. Windmere also pared the length of the offers and changed to a redemption house that destroys processed forms.  Helen of Troy Corp., an El Paso, Texas, rival to Windmere, has tried to enhance its rebates without increasing the chances of fraud. Now, it offers two-tiered \"bonus rebates.\" To get $7 back on a hair dryer, for example, the consumer now sends in a $5 coupon to one redemption house and a $2 coupon to a second. Lawrence S. Cohen, the vice president of marketing, thinks thieves will prefer a softer target -- one that pays $7 all at once. There\\'s no guarantee, though, that the new rebate rules won\\'t annoy honest consumers more than they deter industrious thieves.  Coleman isn\\'t being so subtle. The company estimates that in 1986 its earnings were reduced $2 million because of rebate fraud; in the last four months its redemption rate -- long steady at about 24% -- jumped to 40%. Now, besides cutting the number and length of such offers, it is printing warnings on the redemption forms that mail fraud is a felony. And it has hired consultants to help it replace rebates with other kinds of promotions.  Most companies are relying on their clearinghouses to tackle the problem. \"Anybody who doesn\\'t have a concern is sticking his head in the sand,\" says Harlan Strong, the vice president of sales of Young America Corp., a Minnesota clearinghouse. Mr. Strong says the company used to post an employee at a landfill site to make sure Young America\\'s trash got buried, not stolen. Now it shreds the forms before they leave the premises.  But can the perpetrators ever be defeated? Some marketers fear not. Says Francis Doyle, the president of ACS Marketing Services: \"Anything we do, it seems that crooks find a way around it.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0104': 'Regulatory Changes to Help Oil Industry --- By Andy Pasztor Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> A comprehensive Energy Department report provides support for various tax incentives and regulatory changes to prop up the U.S. petroleum industry, while dimming prospects for any fee on oil imports.  The long-awaited study, which was requested by President Reagan, also highlights the need to harness nuclear power, coal and natural-gas reserves to protect against what it predicts may be a near-doubling in oil imports by the mid-1990s. And it suggests that despite White House opposition, accelerated filling of the government\\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be an important move to safeguard U.S. energy security.  Calling the report a \"warning signal,\" Energy Secretary John Herrington told reporters that current production and consumption trends pose \"a clear risk\" to U.S. long-term national-security interests that can\\'t be ignored. Based on the report\\'s main findings, Mr. Herrington asserted, \"it is time to plan\" new initiatives and reassess some of the administration\\'s longstanding energy policies.  The report is likely to help shape intensifying congressional and cabinet debate over the problems of domestic oil producers. The report doesn\\'t contain any firm policy recommendations, however, and doesn\\'t go nearly as far in proposing solutions as many oil-state lawmakers and domestic oil producers advocated.  Other critics asserted that the report understates the role of renewable energy resources, and that its findings will be used to reduce environmental protection for offshore drilling sites and in Alaska\\'s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  In a series of detailed cost-benefit analyses, the report indicates that imposition of a $10-a-barrel fee on imported oil would slash at least $32 billion in one year from the nation\\'s gross national product. \"I don\\'t see this as a viable option,\" Mr. Herrington said.  The oil industry itself is sharply divided over the issue, with independent producers overwhelmingly supporting such a fee while some major international oil companies oppose it as an invitation to other taxes and a potentially cumbersome measure to enforce.  A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute said the \"thrust of the report seems to be in the right direction, although it may somewhat understate the problem.\" Reflecting the views of many independents in the oil patch, George Mitchell, chairman of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., said the report \"all but rules out\" an import fee, which he called \"the only option that can make an immediate difference\" for the industry.  The report and Mr. Herrington\\'s comments suggest that the administration is searching for a politically palatable compromise that will demonstrate its commitment to help the industry without abandoning free-market principles. \"It\\'s an effort to buy the White House some political peace,\" asserted Edwin Rothschild, a spokesman for Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition, \"rather than practical prescriptions for a sound and coherent national energy policy.\"  By the end of 1995, according to the report, Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65% of the free world\\'s total oil consumption.  In discussing the most effective ways to spur domestic production, the report suggests higher depletion allowances, repeal of the 1980 windfall-profits tax, and repeal of the so-called transfer rule, which relates to tax treatment of certain properties purchased by independents from major oil companies.

       " 'WSJ870318-0103': 'Decline in Rates Reduces Interest In \\'Zero\\' Issues --- By John R. Dorfman Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) </IN> With the long drop in interest rates, corporate zero-coupon bonds haven\\'t been getting much attention lately.  That\\'s probably just as well for many investors. But for others, some market professionals say, corporate \"zeros\" could be worth a fresh look.  Zero-coupon bonds, which are issued at a steep discount from their face value, were very popular when rates were high. Not only could investors \"lock in\" a high rate of return for years to come, they didn\\'t have to worry about how to reinvest periodic interest payments because there aren\\'t any. Instead, investors profit from the difference between the issue price and the face amount payable at maturity.  Last year, however, corporations issued only $703.3 million of zero-coupon bonds, according to IDD Information Services Inc. That was less than a third of the record $2.46 billion issued in 1985.  Uncertainty about tax overhaul discouraged both issuers and buyers in 1986, but lower interest rates were the major factor. \"You don\\'t need to lock in an 8% return,\" says Richard S. Wilson, vice president for securities research and economics at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.  Moreover, with most economists now expecting interest rates to rise later this year, buying any kind of long-term bond carries a growing risk of principal loss for those who can\\'t hold the issue until maturity. Zeros are especially risky because they react more extremely than conventional bonds to changes in interest rates.  And in case of default, investors could be left empty-handed. Holders of conventional bonds would at least have the solace of their previous interest payments.  Nonetheless, some bond traders say that more investors ought to be considering zero-coupon corporates, especially for individual retirement accounts. Patrick M. Fay, a vice president for corporate bond trading at First Boston Corp. who says he is continuing to buy corporate zeros for his own IRA, finds the yields to be \"very attractive\" compared with those of alternative long-term investments.  The annual rate of return on corporate zeros of the safest, AAA-rated issuers, such as the World Bank, is around 8.5% for bonds maturing in 20 years, he says. That\\'s about half a percentage point more than so-called stripped Treasury bonds -- Treasury securities repackaged by brokerage firms to be sold as zero-coupon issues. In general, corporate zeros also provide somewhat higher yields than their coupon-bearing corporate counterparts.  Buying corporate zeros for an IRA neutralizes their most obvious disadvantage -- the tax treatment. With rare exceptions, such bonds trigger personal income tax each year on the theoretical accumulation, or \"accretion,\" of interest. That means investors pay tax on money they haven\\'t yet received. If the bonds are bought for an IRA, however, no tax is due until the money is withdrawn.  For purchases outside the protective frame of an IRA, Fredric W. Levin, a general partner with Lazard Freres &amp; Co., suggests three particular issues -- General Motors Acceptance Corp. (GMAC) zeros due in 2012, GMAC zeros of 2015, and Exxon Shipping Co. zeros of 2012. These three aren\\'t subject to tax on the interest as it accumulates, because of a short-lived tax loophole. The loophole, which existed briefly in late 1982, applied to corporations that used the proceeds of zero-coupon issues to pay off other corporate debt.  Mr. Levin estimates that there are about $500 million of the special GMAC and Exxon Shipping bonds. Anticipated yields to maturity are about 35 to 40 basis points (or hundredths of a percentage point) below those of corporate zeros of comparable quality without the tax-deferral feature.  But with so few ways available for individuals to defer taxes, Mr. Levin says, these bonds are \"one of the best ideas for individuals that I know about.\"  Still, some professional traders are willing to brave the tax consequences of trading even \"regular\" corporate zeros. Mark Fishman, a senior bond trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., is one of them. Without claiming to predict longer-term interest-rate trends, Mr. Fishman aims to achieve capital gains by nimbly trading zeros to take advantage of short-term interest-rate fluctuations.  Of course, even short-term volatility can mean losses for those who guess wrong. But the opportunity for gain is substantial, Mr. Fishman says, for those with \"a real feel for the market.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0100': 'Eastern Bloc\\'s Entrenched Bureaucrats Are Wary of Gorbachev\\'s Bold Reforms --- By Victoria Pope Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Pravda is suddenly a best seller in the capitals of Eastern Europe.  The Soviet Communist Party newspaper used to gather dust in street-corner kiosks of the Eastern bloc. It was sold for comradely reasons, not because it said anything Czechs or East Germans wanted to know. But Pravda is picking up readers as some of Moscow\\'s Communist neighbors have censored from the local press meatier bits of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s speeches on the need for more openness in Soviet society and less central control of the economy.  Entrenched Communist bureaucrats are wary of change in the status quo, even when Moscow takes the lead; dissidents have a sinking feeling that Mr. Gorbachev\\'s bold proposals are just windowdressing. And it hasn\\'t escaped the attention of either group that Mr. Gorbachev\\'s goal is a strong Soviet Union, an objective that intensifies the region\\'s phobia about domination from the East.  If the old men ruling most of Eastern Europe aren\\'t welling up with enthusiasm for Mr. Gorbachev\\'s reforms, it\\'s partly because their careers are at stake. Erich Honecker of East Germany, Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia, Todor Zhikov of Bulgaria and Janos Kadar of Hungary are remnants of the Brezhnev era. They are used to a client-master relationship in which the master is tough but predictable. Now the Kremlin leader is seen as a complex master, shaking up this modus vivendi whether he intends to or not.  They know only too well that reform means something different to Soviets and Eastern Europeans. In the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev\\'s call for \"glasnost,\" or openness, reaches a population with no tradition of individual freedom. In the Eastern bloc, however, the silhouettes of democratic thought, however faint, are part of the national birthright.  For almost as long as their alliance with the Soviets has existed, the Eastern Europeans have experimented with liberalizations -- Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Poland most recently in 1980. Time and again, following repression, they have faced the bitter truth that once the status quo is seriously challenged, reforms are rolled back.  For Communist stalwarts, Mr. Gorbachev must spark recollections of Nikita Khrushchev, whose reforms in the 1950s ended the Stalinist era, but ushered in riots in Hungary and Poland. Such memories lead to the question: Will Mr. Gorbachev, like Mr. Khrushchev, push too hard and fall in disgrace?  However gun-shy, some Eastern Europeans express cautious hope. In Czechoslovakia, members of the reform movement Prague Spring are said to feel vindicated by Mr. Gorbachev\\'s attacks on sluggish leaders. Poland\\'s Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski is enthusiastically backing the Gorbachev line. In Warsaw, censorship has eased and there is serious talk in official newspapers of the publication soon of George Orwell\\'s previously banned study in totalitarianism, \"1984.\"  One political dissident in Warsaw even admitted the other day that he was fascinated by Mr. Gorbachev. This man ultimately controls my life, he said, and perhaps he will control me benignly.  The wish for \"benign neglect\" underscores the essential pessimism of many Eastern Europeans. They see Mr. Gorbachev as a \"good czar,\" not a herald of democracy.  The track record shows Mr. Gorbachev can be tough, demanding more cooperation within the bloc and better quality in the goods sent to Moscow.  Economists in Budapest are especially outspoken about admitting that Hungary\\'s trade links to the Soviet Union often hurt more than help. In recent weeks an official report even suggested that Hungary rid itself of two investment projects, one with Czechoslovakia to construct dams on the Danube River and another to build a gas pipeline with the Soviet Union. Such frank talk isn\\'t likely to please the Kremlin, whatever claims on openness it now has.  Other strains are surfacing as the bloc tries to come to terms with Mr. Gorbachev\\'s ideas. At a recent ideological conference in Warsaw, East German and Czech representatives heatedly told Soviet delegates that if they wanted to talk about grand experiments, they should do it quietly. Only the Polish Communists were gung-ho. By the end of the conference, Soviet delegates made clear that calls for glasnost were meant for Soviet consumption, not for Eastern Europe.  Despite these signals, Eastern European authorities inevitably will begin to sound a Gorbachev line, out of habit if not conviction. Czech hard-liners are showing signs of jumping on the bandwagon. Last month, Vasil Bilak, the Czech Communist Party ideologue, was lambasting as opportunists those who would use Gorbachev-style reforms for their own political ends. This month, his emphasis is on reform and the good it can do.  Where Mr. Gorbachev\\'s breathtaking initiatives will lead isn\\'t known. But by rhetoric alone, he may be unwittingly forcing Eastern Europe\\'s leaders to raise expectations they can\\'t fulfill. ',\n",

The company, 50%-owned by Noranda Inc., said the new price, after taking discounts into effect, will rise to $552.90 (U.S.) a metric ton from $514.43.  MacMillan Bloedel, which sells mainly to western U.S. publishers, said the new list price is $600 a metric ton, less a 5% discount for contract performance and an extra 3% discount called a \"temporary competitive allowance.\" The company previously had a list price of $570 a metric ton, less the 5% contract performance discount and less a 5% allowance.  Another western Canadian newsprint producer, British Columbia Forest Products Ltd. of Vancouver, declined to say whether it would raise its price in response to MacMillan Bloedel\\'s action. A spokesman for British Columbia Forest said the company was \"taken by surprise\" by the announcement, but he added that \"the market is firming.\"  James Rowland, publisher of Canadian Paper Analyst, a Montreal-based industry newsletter, called the price increase \"the thin edge of the wedge\" that probably will lead to newsprint price boosts by eastern Canadian producers, too.

       " 'WSJ870318-0098': 'Then Bring Them Into Its Service Area --- By Dianna Solis Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) UTILITIES (UTI) NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK) </IN> El Paso Electric Co. is adopting an unusual diversification formula: It hopes to buy companies and move them into its service area.  With $118 million committed to a special budget, El Paso Electric this week received the initial blessing of state regulators in New Mexico for a diversification-by-acquisition program. The purchases would be conducted by a new holding-company unit, PasoTex Corp.  But in addition to buying non-utility businesses, El Paso Electric hopes to relocate them from elsewhere in the U.S. into its service market. The utility hopes three of its proposed acquisition targets would bring 500 to 700 new jobs to El Paso, which has an unemployment rate of nearly 12%.  The company already has begun takeover negotiations with such diverse small and medium-sized businesses as a lamp company in New Jersey and a paper-folding machine company in Ohio. El Paso Electric wouldn\\'t elaborate on the status of the negotiations.  Regulatory clearance for the acquistions wouldn\\'t be required in Texas.  El Paso Electric says the acquisitions also would be aimed at stimulating demand for its electricity, as well as generating non-utility revenue for a utility with nearly $1 billion invested in the $9.3 billion Palo Verde nuclear project near Phoenix, Ariz., the nation\\'s largest nuclear station. Although the company reported 1986 profit of $96 million on revenue of $318 million, about 86% of that amount was non-cash profit recorded under an accounting rule that allows utilities to treat plant construction costs as income on the premise that those costs will be recouped through rate increases.  \"We face a real uncertain future on the rate of return (on Palo Verde),\" Kenneth Perry, a company spokesman, said. \"So we\\'re trying to spur economic growth and spur electricity growth.\"  The planned diversification would be financed from $684 million in profit from the sale and lease-back last year of its 15.8% stake in Unit 2 of the Palo Verde project. It still holds the same-size stakes in the other two units.  El Paso Electric\\'s diversification moves may also help stimulate some sorely needed citizen support. The utility that once proclaimed itself El Paso\\'s \"No. 1 corporate citizen\" has in recent years collected the highest residential rates in Texas, generating consumer ill will.  Utility diversification is gaining steam among utilities fearful that they won\\'t recover their investments in nuclear plants. For example, Houston Industries Inc. and Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Co. both have bought interests in cable-television concerns in the last two years.  El Paso Electric has yet to receive regulatory approval for any Palo Verde-related rate increases in its Texas or New Mexico service areas. And, in fact, when the utility asked for higher rates, tightfisted Texas regulators gave the utility a rate decrease of $14.5 million annually last January. Hearings on rate increases in both states are expected this spring.  The out-of-town companies the utility is negotiating to buy are Baumfolder Corp., a Sidney, Ohio-based maker of paper-cutters and folders; Westwood Lighting Group Inc., a Paterson, N.J.-based lamp maker; and San Angelo Electric Service Co., a San Angelo, Texas-based transformer builder. El Paso Electric also is in talks to acquire Border Steel Inc., a steel-rod maker near here. All are closely held.  Though El Paso Electric wishes to move the businesses, Peter Lovato, chief executive officer of San Angelo Electric Service, foresees some difficulties. While the company is amenable to a takeover, he said, moving \"substantial facilities\" with 100 employees \"would be difficult.\" Officials at the other three companies couldn\\'t be reached.  El Paso Electric is no novice to unusual diversification moves. Through a land development unit, it has refurbished three downtown El Paso landmarks, including a $60 million restoration of an elegant, turnof-the-century hotel. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0096': 'Are PIGs the Right Solution For Investors in Tax Shelters? --- By Robert Guenther Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL) CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN> PASSIVE-INCOME GENERATORS, better known as PIGs, are being billed as the solution for many investors who find they can no longer make use of all the tax deductions generated by their real-estate limited partnerships. But many investment advisers are wondering: Where\\'s the bacon?  The new tax law phases out individual investors\\' ability to shelter earned income by using paper losses from passive investments such as limited partnerships that put their money into real estate. So brokers came up with the concept of PIGs, investments paying cash returns that can be offset by losses from passive investments. As it turns out, though, PIGs seem to work better in theory than reality.  Here is why: It\\'s hard to create passive-income generators that don\\'t have some income already sheltered from taxes. Moreover, a huge investment is needed to generate sufficient taxable income to use up any unused passive losses. For instance, an investor with $10,000 in passive losses would need to invest $100,000 in a partnership paying 10% in unsheltered cash income to make full use of those losses.  WARREN SHINE, a partner in the Ernst &amp; Whinney accounting firm, says: \"The brokerage firms have been so mesmerized by the PIG that, as a result, we\\'re getting some bizarre reactions from clients. For instance, we\\'re seeing some attractive partnerships paying 9% to 10% cash with some shelter. But clients are saying, \\'I don\\'t want it; I want something that gives me passive income.\\' Some fairly bright people are saying this. If the cash flow is real, that is what counts. Using up passive losses is simply a timing issue for tax purposes.\"  So, what does an investor do about excess passive losses? A few brokerage firms, notably Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton, have offered to solve the problem by repurchasing some tax-oriented partnerships. A Merrill Lynch Capital Markets spokeswoman says the company has bought back more than $37 million in partnership units where investors were still obligated to make capital contributions. Similarly, Hutton has set aside a portion of a $130 million reserve for repurchase of net-lease partnerships. Some of Integrated Resources Inc.\\'s 200 partnerships have sold properties or made early capital payments to reduce problems for investors.  --- Resort Developers Offer Quarter Shares Resort condo quarter shares are starting to catch on with vacationers who are turned off by time-share projects but can\\'t afford to own resort apartments on their own. The concept isn\\'t new; families often have gotten together in the past to buy a resort home jointly. Today\\'s twist is that resort developments are selling quarter shares directly to buyers instead of leaving it up to buyers to find partners. Each quarter-share owner gets the use of the condo for two weeks out of every eight weeks.  In Hilton Head, S.C., Harborside III in Palmetto Dunes Resort already has reservations for all 156 quarter shares before sales officially begin. Quarter shares in the project are selling from $55,000 to $89,900 with units ranging in size from 700 to 2,100 square feet. Russ Brown, Harborside III\\'s sales agent, says the success of the concept comes as no surprise because in past projects, sales of resort condos often involved multiple buyers.  In Ocean City, Md., Second National Building &amp; Loan Association of Annapolis is co-developer of the Quarters, a 27-unit project with quarter shares priced from $39,000 to $49,000. The project is about half sold. Henry Berliner, president of Second National, says quarter-share projects avoid many of the problems of time shares, including difficulties in selling the loan paper and in dealing with many parties in the event of foreclosure.  --- NEW YORK\\'S TRIBECA neighborhood, once the frontier for loft living, now has its first new private apartment project in years.

Though People Express operations have been consolidated into Texas Air\\'s Continental Airlines unit, the spokesman noted, People Express remains a separate legal entity. As a result, the effect of a People Express bankruptcy-law filing on Continental\\'s operations would be \"none,\" the spokesman said.  Some analysts link growing concern about the effect of the People Express acquisition to a steep, recent slide in Texas Air\\'s stock price. After climbing above $51 recently, the share price has plummeted almost $10 in recent trading sessions. However, in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texas Air shares rose 87.5 cents to close at $42.50.  The main group that would be affected by a People Express bankruptcy-law filing are the unit\\'s creditors. As of late 1986, according to the preliminary prospectus, People Express had debt of $391.4 million, much of it held by institutional investors in Europe, as well as by Texas Air itself. If there were a filing, Texas Air -- as parent of People Express -- would receive lowest priority among creditors.  People Express wouldn\\'t be the first Texas Air unit to seek bankruptcy-law protection. In September 1983, Continental filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate with protection from creditors\\' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt.  Whether it ever files for Chapter 11, People Express is a company in trouble. It had a deficit of $350 million last year, and while Texas Air contends that the losses have moderated, the unit is still far from profitability. In addition, as of year-end, People Express was out of compliance with financial covenants required by its Terminal C lease at Newark International Airport, relegating it to month-to-month tenant status, according to the prospectus.  Service problems on Continental routes formerly flown by People Express remain the source of greatest concern, however. Because operating procedures at People Express differed greatly from those of Continental, People Express employees found themselves ill-prepared at Continental after the merger took place. While Continental has been working feverishly to smooth the combination, problems at ticket counters, in baggage handling and flight-crew assignments remain severe.  Former customers agree. New Yorker Barbara Feldman, for instance, was bumped off a flight from Newark to Florida, despite full-fare reservations confirmed weeks in advance. Her luggage, however, made the trip, and wasn\\'t seen for weeks. Terry M. Saigh of San Francisco wrote a letter to Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, describing how \"untrained personnel\" were unable to provide even simple information to stranded passengers and treated them with \"contempt.\"  In a related development, Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. upgraded its rating on Continental Airlines debt to single-B-3 from C to reflect Continental\\'s recent emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings -- but noted that People Express still poses a problem. A rating of C means a company is in default on its debt, and single-B-3 is the lowest grade above default, Moody\\'s said. ',\n",

Barbara McDougall, the minister responsible for selling government-owned companies to the public, has hired two securities firms, McLeod Young Weir Ltd. and Pemberton Houston Willoughby Bell Gouinlock Inc., to report on the feasibility of such a sale. The two Toronto firms are to report by April 1, when the issue, which is politically sensitive, is to be discussed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney\\'s cabinet.  The possible sale of shares in the company, which is wholly owned by the government, is being sharply criticized by the opposition political parties. Liberal Party leader John Turner warned that the move would be \"short-sighted\" because Canada needs a state-owned oil company to carry out its oil policy. Petro-Canada, which has assets of $8.85 billion (Canadian), was established under former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to help make Canada self-sufficient in oil and gas.  Bill Hopper, Petro-Canada\\'s president and chief executive officer, has proposed an initial offering of 10% to 20% of the company\\'s shares. In selling government companies, the Mulroney administration has mainly negotiated sales to private-sector companies. But Mrs. McDougall said she favored a public share offering for Petro-Canada.  Oil industry analysts estimate the government could raise about $500 million in an initial offering of about a 15% stake, which would make it the largest initial offering ever in Canada. \"It wouldn\\'t surprise me to see a portion of (Petro-Canada\\'s) shares come public within six months,\" said Robert Price, an investment analyst with Peters &amp; Co., a Calgary, Alberta, securities firm.  In 1986 Petro-Canada had net income of $182 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $691 million. Year-earlier earnings included a write-off of $865 million.  Analysts anticipate that Petro-Canada shares would be priced attractively to encourage purchases by small investors and allow individual Canadians to make quick capital gains. \"It wouldn\\'t be politically feasible to try and milk the best possible price they could get,\" Mr. Peters said. An initial offering is expected to be limited to Canadians.  A public opinion poll by Angus Reid Associates Inc. last August indicated that 44% of Canadians favor the sale of Petro-Canada, 44% are opposed and 12% have no opinion. The administration of Prime Minister Mulroney has already sold aircraft, fishing, transportation, telecommunications and munitions companies to the private sector. ',\n",

The current account deficit on a balance-of-payments basis followed a revised $35.3 billion gap in the third quarter of 1986 and a $117.68 billion deficit for all of 1985. The third-quarter gap was previously reported as $36.28 billion.  The current account deficit provides a measure of the amount of money the nation must raise abroad, principally from borrowing, to finance the economy. The deficit has expanded rapidly in recent years as the U.S. has become the world\\'s largest debtor nation.  Many economists contend the nation\\'s trade balance will begin to improve this year, largely in response to the dollar\\'s decline against major foreign currencies. Sara Johnson, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., cautioned, however, that \"progress toward restoring balance on the current account will be very gradual.\"  John Green, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, said the amount of interest the U.S. owes on its debt to foreigners will continue to increase. He also noted that the nation\\'s import bill will rise because of higher oil prices and the increase in import prices resulting from the dollar\\'s decline.  In the latest quarter, the nation\\'s surplus in the trade of services narrowed to $5.48 billion from $6.01 billion in the third quarter. The worsening was caused by an increase in private interest payments to foreigners, which count as imports.  Services trade includes earnings brought back to the U.S. by companies with subsidiaries overseas. In the fourth quarter, earnings from direct investment abroad fell to $9.17 billion from $9.46 billion in the third quarter.  The merchandise trade deficit, as the department reported last week, widened to $38.37 billion in the fourth quarter from $37.15 billion in the third.  Overall, exports of goods and services rose to $94.37 billion in the fourth quarter from $92.84 billion, and imports increased to $127.27 billion from $123.98 billion.  The current account figures also include nonmilitary grants, pensions and other government payments abroad, which fell to $3.95 billion in the fourth quarter from $4.16 billion in the third.  The report suggests that foreigners are continuing to shift investment from U.S. Treasury securities into direct investment in such items as plant and equipment.  Net sales of U.S. Treasury securities by private foreigners totaled $2.68 billion in the fourth quarter following net new purchases of $541 million in the third quarter. The department said Japan was responsible for the shift. Direct investment in the U.S. by foreigners rose to $14.44 billion from $5.63 billion.  A measure of the total net flow of capital into the U.S. fell to $59.63 billion from $69.52 billion. A measure of net new U.S. investment abroad rose to $32.94 billion from $28.2 billion.  For the year, the services surplus widened to $22.28 billion from $21.75 billion. The merchandise deficit widened to $147.71 billion from $124.44 billion. The category including nonmilitary grants rose to $15.15 billion from $14.98 billion. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0088': 'Profits for 1986 On 25% Revenue Rise</HL> Genzyme Corp., which went public last year, expects to report a 25% rise in revenue for 1986 and its first fullyear profit since 1981.  Henri Termeer, president and chief executive officer of the biotechnology company, said the company will show 1986 fourth-quarter earnings of $247,000, or three cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.4 million for the year-earlier period. Revenue rose about 8% to $3.5 million from $3.2 million a year ago, Mr. Termeer said.  For the year, profit was about $41,000, or one cent a share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million in 1985. Revenue rose to $12.1 million from $9.7 million a year earlier.  Genzyme, which made a $25 million initial public offering last June, has become increasingly popular among Wall Street analysts during the past few months. The company has achieved profitability quickly -- by industry standards -- by selling specialty chemicals to biotechnology and drug companies. Analysts predict that new products will push its revenue to between $80 million and $100 million by the early 1990s.  Mr. Termeer attributed the company\\'s 1986 improvement mainly to strong sales of enzymes used in making diagnostic test kits and of chemicals used in biotechnology research. He added that Genzyme\\'s future revenue growth will be based largely on products made with the company\\'s proprietary molecule \"remodeling\" technology and with hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring substance used to replace fluids lost during surgery and as an ingredient of cosmetics.  Genzyme\\'s remodeling technology enables it to produce improved versions of drugs by making small but crucial changes to their molecular structures. Using it, the company is developing a drug for Gaucher\\'s disease, an enzyme deficiency that afflicts an estimated 15,000 Americans. Mr. Termeer said Genzyme hopes to begin marketing the drug, which is expected to eventually contribute between $50 million and $100 million to revenue, in mid-1989. ',\n",

In letters to a House subcommittee, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci said they had withdrawn a National Security Council directive broadly defining what amounts to a new security classification of \"sensitive\" information.  The American Civil Liberties Union and the Information Industry Association have contended that the government was planning to apply the definition, in the directive issued last October, in order to restrict the information that gets into data bases and limit who can use the services.  Defense Department officials have contended that they had no such plan, but simply wanted to protect computer systems from unauthorized access by computer hackers and spies.  In addition, Messrs. Baker and Carlucci said they were reviewing another National Security Council directive regarding sensitive information in the hope of quelling fears among information industry companies. That September 1984 directive gives the highly secret National Security Agency a lead role in setting standards for computer security, which civil liberties groups considered an unwanted intrusion into civilian areas.  A bill introduced by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, would shift much of that role to the Commerce Department and the National Bureau of Standards. It would also make clear that the purpose of government action is to protect computer systems from unauthorized access, not to limit the dissemination of information.  Kenneth Allen, senior vice president of the Information Industry Association, a trade association of information-service companies, said he was \"delighted\" that \"the administration recognized it made a mistake.\" But he said he wasn\\'t convinced that the government had dropped its plans to restrict data bases. Jerry Berman, legislative counsel of the ACLU, said he was forming a coalition of groups to monitor the situation.  On Monday, a Defense Department official said the government was concerned about security problems posed by data bases, which collect millions of documents and let customers comb through them in minutes by computer. \"But we don\\'t have a notion of what to do with\" data bases, the official said.  Defense Department officials have been pondering for some time how to limit access to information it deems sensitive. The 1984 National Security directive warns that information contained in data bases, \"even if unclassified in isolation, often can reveal highly classified and other sensitive information when taken in aggregate.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0086': 'If It Is Spun Off in a Limited Partnership --- By Linda Williams Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> RJR Nabisco Inc. said it expects to retain at least 95% ownership of its tobacco business if it decides to spin off the line in a master limited partnership.  The disclosure prompted speculation from some analysts that the company has decided on its first step toward eventually shedding most, if not all, of its tobacco business.  Reynolds earlier said it was considering a master limited partnership for the tobacco business. But the disclosure of the possible ownership stake is the company\\'s first indication that it has a specific structure in mind.  Offering only 5% of the business would be \"the best way to test the water, to see how the market values the tobacco business,\" said Joseph C. Frazzano, analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. \"If they\\'re satisfied, they could sell more of it,\" he said.  Neal Kaplan, analyst with Interstate Securities Corp., said that to take full advantage of tax benefits from a master limited partnership, the company must sell at least a majority of the tobacco business.  Despite the tobacco, food and beverage concern\\'s latest disclosure, some analysts -- citing big legal, tax and other obstacles to creating tobacco partnerships -- are still skeptical that the company will choose a partnership to shed its tobacco business.  It is \"certainly not imminent and may not be possible,\" said David A. Goldman, analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc.  RJR suggested the possibility of a 95%-owned partnership in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing on an unrelated debt offering.  \"Under the proposal currently being studied, one or more of RJR\\'s affiliates would be the general partner or partners of the master limited partnership and would continue to be responsible for directing the business operations of the tobacco business,\" the filing said. \"It is currently anticipated that RJR would retain ownership of partnership interests representing at least 95% of the economic value of the partnership. RJR hasn\\'t determined whether this proposal or any other similar or different proposal to restructure its tobacco business will be implemented,\" the company said. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the filing.  Some industry sources believe that RJR is considering the 95% partnership option as the least-controversial means of possibly separating the tobacco business. It would test the value of the tobacco business, which the company believes isn\\'t receiving fair value in the marketplace, while soothing the feelings of its home town, Winston-Salem, N.C., as it prepares to move the corporate headquarters to Atlanta in September.  For months, analysts, employees and industry executives have speculated that RJR would like to get out of the tobacco business, or move to distance itself from the business and its product-liability problems.  But the master limited partnership wouldn\\'t insulate the company, as general partner, from the potential liability posed by lawsuits from cancer victims. Analysts also note that the tobacco operations would be hard to sell in the form of a partnership because of sheer size. RJR\\'s U.S. tobacco business had profit from operations of almost $1.5 billion in 1986. And pricing the units to reflect the risks would be an obstacle to their sale, some analysts said.  One reason the 95% option doesn\\'t seem viable in the long run is that the dividends RJR would receive as general partner would be taxable and the company might not see much improvement in its own stock price as a result of the spinoff. Partnership investors also would receive an after-tax dividend that is less than the company\\'s current after-tax dividend.  \"We don\\'t think it is a value-enhancing move,\" said Diana K. Temple, analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Initially, only U.S. cigarette operations could be converted to a partnership because it isn\\'t clear that foreign tax laws would permit a partnership, she said. Also, if RJR\\'s debt, which is expected to be $3.8 billion at yearend, is split evenly between Nabisco and the domestic tobacco business, Nabisco would be left with $1.9 billion in debt, but only $143 million in annual cash flow, she said.  Still, the master limited partnership has some appeal to investors. Selling a mere 5% of the tobacco business would allow the company to retain control of a valuable asset while generating a huge infusion of cash that could be used to buy back shares or to further diversify.  --- RJR Unit to Sell Division TORONTO -- Nabisco Brands Ltd. said it is seeking a buyer for its confectionery division, which makes such brands as Planters nuts and Life Savers candy in Canada.  The proposed sale is part of the RJR Nabisco Inc. unit\\'s plan to focus on its most-profitable interests, including its biscuits and cereals business, a spokeswoman said. She declined to estimate the division\\'s value or its contribution to Nabisco\\'s sales or earnings.  Nabisco has retained Burns Fry Ltd., a securities dealer here, as a financial adviser.  Nabisco is one of Canada\\'s largest consumer-goods companies, with sales of $941.7 million (Canadian) in the year ended Dec. 31. In 1986, Nabisco sold several assets, including its Fleischmann division operations and its pet food interests. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0085': 'To Farmers Hurt By Drought, Floods --- By Albert R. Kerr Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> The House approved a bill to give disaster-relief assistance to wheat and corn farmers whose plantings were disrupted by late-1986 drought or floods.  The House voted 304-100 for the legislation, a scaled-down version of a measure that also would have offered similar subsidies to farmers who decide to plant little or no wheat in 1987, as a way of shrinking some of the nation\\'s huge farm surplus and reducing the government\\'s costs of taking over and storing surplus grain.  The earlier plan was shelved by the House Agriculture Committee last week because panel members wanted to wait for budget-cutting instructions in the pending congressional budget resolution for fiscal 1988, which begins next Oct. 1.  The plan paying farmers not to plant crops would reduce government costs, and lawmakers wanted to apply such savings to the budget-trimming figure assigned to the Agriculture Committees. Congressional budget drafters have tentatively said they\\'ll want to trim $1 billion in farm spending in fiscal 1988, but that figure might be enlarged.  The shelved House Agriculture plan would have given farmers 92% of their usual income-protecting \"deficiency\" payments if they idled their land. The measure approved yesterday also would provide the 92% level of payments to eligible farmers.  Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.), chairman of the Agriculture Committee\\'s wheat, soybeans and feed grains subcommittee, introduced a broader version of the plan, which would offer the same kind of benefits to growers of 1987 and 1988 corn and wheat crops.  A commmittee staff member said that according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the Glickman bill would result in annual savings of about $150 million in fiscal 1988 and 1989. Farm-subsidy spending usually lags a year behind the crop year to which the benefits apply.  The limited disaster-relief bill approved by the House would spend $27 million less in deficiency payments than if the farmers had received the full amount of deficiency payments from planting, the staff member said.  The House bill now must be reconciled with the previously passed Senate bill, which offers disaster relief for farmers of 1986-87 winter wheat. ',\n",

Twenty-eight Japanese banks, including some of the nation\\'s largest, will establish the company in the Cayman Islands by March 31, when Japan\\'s fiscal year ends. The new company is expected to be called JBA Investors Inc.  \"Basically, it is a garbage can. And all the banks want to stuff their loans,\" said one Japanese banker, who asked not to be identified.  The banks will initially sell at a discount about $6 billion of Mexican loans to the new company, banking sources said. Then the company will either pool the loans and try to resell them to investors or hold them to maturity.  At first, the banks will be allowed to sell only their Mexican loans to the company. And the amount will be limited to no more than 70% of one loan. Later, bankers expect to be able to sell other sovereign loans. Some bankers suggest that loans to Brazil will be next.  As preferred shareholders, the banks will receive dividends if a borrower makes interest or principal payments. If not, the new company will incur the losses, not the parent banks. Participating banks, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., will also pay $3,000 each for common equity shares, creating an up-front capital base of $84,000 for the company.  U.S. banks aren\\'t likely to imitate the Japanese action. Several U.S. bankers said they aren\\'t yet clear on how the plan would work, or how much of the Japanese banks\\' loans the new company would receive. Some doubt such a plan would be workable under U.S. regulations. Japanese bankers in the U.S. have played down the new concern, calling it a shell company that will have a relatively small capital base and be operated just by an administrative staff.  Bank of Tokyo\\'s chairman, Yasuke Kashiwagi, characterized the plan as a modest way to compensate for Japan\\'s tax laws. Japanese banks are allowed to set aside only 5% of a loan outstanding in loan-loss reserves, and only 1% of the loan is tax deductible. But that\\'s better than in the U.S., where -- following the new tax law -- banks can get tax deductions for their loan-loss reserves only when they can actually justify or document a loss, New York accountants say.  Regulations vary for European banks, although they are usually more generous. In Britain only specific loan-loss reserves are generally tax deductible. In Switzerland and West Germany, tax authorities have allowed banks tax-deductible loan-loss reserves for a large percentage of their Third World debt, sometimes ranging as high as 20% or 30%.  Japanese bankers said the new company should improve their balance sheets by allowing them to claim tax deductions on the losses that stem from selling the loans at a discount.  While the new company will be established just a few weeks after Brazil suspended interest payments on about $67 billion of its foreign debt, Japanese bank officials said they have been discussing the project for months.  Although the Finance Ministry isn\\'t supporting the new company financially, ministry officials have offered \"guidance\" on tax rules and procedure. \"If it helps Japanese banks deal with the debt problem, then we aren\\'t opposed to the plan,\" said one Finance Ministry official.  Japanese banks have the second-largest Third World debt exposure -- the U.S. has the largest -- and the Finance Ministry estimates that Japanese banks outstanding loans to Latin American countries totaled $30 billion at the end of 1985. Of that total, Mexico accounted for about $13 billion and Brazil for about $10 billion. Bankers and analysts in Tokyo said most of the medium- to long-term commerical bank loans were extended to finance state-owned projects.  Among Japanese banks, Bank of Tokyo has the largest debt exposure in Latin America, mainly because of its role as Japan\\'s leading international and foreign-exchange bank.  In a 1987 report on Japanese banks, the British stockbrokerage James Capel &amp; Co. said the Bank of Tokyo\\'s \"exposure to heavily indebted countries may be in excess of one trillion yen ($6.6 billion), or 13% of its total loan portfolio.\" Bank of Tokyo officials said the figure is too high, but declined to give their own figure. Unlike U.S. banks, Japanese banks aren\\'t required to disclose loan portfolio figures.  Because of its large loan exposure, Mr. Kashiwagi said the Bank of Tokyo will be one of the main beneficiaries of the new company.  While Japanese bankers are concerned by Brazil\\'s debt moratorium, they don\\'t seem to believe that failure to reach a rescheduling agreement would devastate them. \"If all the Third World debt would go bad, no Japanese bank would be technically bankrupted,\" said a bank analyst for a major U.S. stockbrokerage here.  Japanese banks have been bailed out by the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. In just 18 months, the value of Japanese loans to Latin American countries, which generally are denominated in U.S. dollars, has declined more than 50%.  Also, many analysts say Japanese banks are stronger than they appear in terms of capital-asset ratios. Japanese banks reportedly have significant hidden assets, including real estate and stock holdings valued at their purchase price rather than current market value.  Despite this latest move to reduce their debt exposure, Japanese bankers say they aren\\'t withdrawing their support for the international financial system. \"We are willing to cooperate with American banks, Brazil and other international financial institutions,\" said a senior official at the Bank of Tokyo.  Even so, Japanese bankers said they aren\\'t ready to make additional loans unless debtor nations take concrete steps to stabilize their economies or international insitutions step in and reduce the risk by offering some sort of guarantee. Mr. Kashiwagi said that without international coordination and cooperation, there is a limit to what Japanese banks can do. ',\n",

Allegheny announced last week that a unit of First Boston Corp. had arranged a buyout of the consumer and industrial products concern valued at about $500 million, or about $24.60 a share.  In Washington, Gary Lynch, who heads the SEC\\'s enforcement division, declined comment.  The buyout proposal evidently accelerated a yearlong SEC investigation of, among other things, corporate spending at Allegheny. The SEC began an inquiry in February 1986 as Allegheny faced increasing pressure from shareholders, banks and analysts for spending heavily on corporate overhead while posting huge losses. For the year ended Dec. 29, 1985, Allegheny posted a $109.1 million net loss on sales of $2.1 billion.  According to the filing, the SEC was looking at executive compensation and benefits, as well as expenditures relating to certain company-owned real estate, use of corporate aircraft, travel and entertainment. The company also provided information regarding certain acquisitions and divestitures, accounting and other internal control systems.  The SEC inquiry escalated to a formal investigation of possible federal securities-law violations in August 1986. At that time, Business Week magazine and several shareholder suits charged that extravagant spending by former management was seriously undermining the company. Soon after, Robert J. Buckley resigned as chairman and chief executive officer.  Allegheny said the commission continues to take testimony from employees and others, whom the company wouldn\\'t identify.  The tender offer for Allegheny, which began Friday, also prompted opposition from shareholders involved in ongoing lawsuits against Allegheny and its management. A new lawsuit was filed Monday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court here charging that price of the offer isn\\'t fair. First Boston beat out another bidder that wasn\\'t identified during intense negotiations the weekend preceding the buyout announcement.  Richard Greenfield, an attorney representing shareholders in one suit, said he believes the buyout was intended to absolve well-known board members, including former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., of the possible liability and embarrassment from existing suits.  Allegheny board member Richard M. Cyert, president of Carnegie Mellon University, also is a member of the First Boston board. Allegheny said Mr. Cyert took part in board meetings during which the buyout was discussed, but abstained from voting.  Mr. Greenfield said Mr. Cyert\\'s presence on both boards is a \"clear conflict of interest.\" Mr. Cyert wasn\\'t available for comment.  Allegheny also disclosed in its filing that 1987 operating profit could total $60.7 million. In 1986, Allegheny had a net loss of $164 million, including a $198.1 million loss from continuing operations and earnings of $34.1 million from discontinued operations. Sales were $1.33 billion.

       " 'WSJ870318-0078': 'Of Superconductor in Computer Race --- By Jerry E. Bishop Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> COMPUTERS (EDP) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN> Energy Conversion Devices Inc. jumped into the race to develop superconducting electronic devices that could open the way to superfast computers.  The small, Troy, Mich.-based solar energy concern announced here that its scientists had developed a thin film of material that is a perfect electrical conductor at temperatures as \"warm\" as 80 degrees above absolute zero. This means that electronic devices made with the new film could operate immersed in liquid nitrogen instead of the prohibitively expensive liquid helium.  Superconductors are materials that have lost all resistance to electricity. A superconductor will carry an electric current without loss of energy, in contrast to normal conductors such as copper wires, in which 10% or more of a current\\'s energy is lost.  Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has been known for decades but confined largely to the laboratory. This is because the materials, including lead, that become superconductors do so only at a few degrees above absolute zero, or 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The materials are kept in the superconducting state by immersing them in super-cold liquid helium. The costs of such helium refrigeration have been so high that superconductors have been limited to a few exotic scientific uses, such as superconducting magnets for atom smashers.  In the past several weeks, however, several scientific teams have announced discoveries of compounds that are superconductors at much higher temperatures. Last month, researchers at the University of Houston and the University of Alabama in Huntsville said they had discovered some materials that are superconductors at temperatures as high as 93 degrees above absolute zero (93 degrees Kelvin). Because such materials can be cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen instead of helium, refrigeration costs could be cut as much as 90%, making superconductors economically practical, provided the materials could be fabricated into useful wires and devices.  Energy Conversion President Stanford R. Ovshinsky announced the new thin-film superconductor here yesterday as a major scientific meeting began, in which the new superconductor breakthroughs were to be discussed by physicists. Though apparently timed to coincide with the scientific meeting, the Energy Conversion development wasn\\'t scheduled to be presented or discussed at the session.  The Energy Conversion announcement of an 80-degree Kelvin superconducting thin film follows by three days an announcement by Stanford University scientists that they had developed a thin-film material that is superconducting at 40 degrees Kelvin. The Stanford researchers had hailed the ability to lay down a thin film of superconducting material as being the key to early application of superconductors in electronic devices. Many existing electronic devices are made using thin films, that is, layers of materials measured in thicknesses of millionths of an inch.  Thin film, superconducting electronic parts for computers and other devices wouldn\\'t lose energy through heat. Thus, microscopic superconducting devices could be placed closer together on a chip, reducing the time it takes for electronic signals to travel from one device to another. The result would be far faster and hence more powerful computers.  Energy Conversion\\'s Mr. Ovshinsky said that 100% of the material laid down as a thin film was superconducting, in contrast to only 2% to 20% of the material that was superconducting in the University of Houston experiments. Mr. Ovshinsky said in an interview that his material consisted of the same elements and compounds as the Houston superconductor but was mixed in different ratios. The material is an yttrium-barium-copper oxide.  As in past developments, Mr. Ovshinsky\\'s announcement is likely to be controversial until he presents proof of his claims. The self-educated scientist, whose small company is having financial problems, said he has a new theory of superconductivity that has been confirmed by some prominent physicists and will be published soon. In the 1960s, Mr. Ovshinsky burst onto the scene with a new theory of transistor-like effects in noncrystalline materials, which was initially derided by scientists but was later confirmed as being correct. His company is based largely on producing these noncrystalline materials mainly for direct conversion of solar energy to electricity.  Since it became a public company in 1960, Energy Conversion hasn\\'t ever reported an operating profit. In the fiscal year ended last June 30, the company had a net loss of $27.9 million on revenue of $21.1 million. For the fiscal 1987 first half ended Dec. 31, Energy Conversion had a loss of $15.5 million on revenue of $5.4 million. Like most research and development concerns, Energy Conversion has survived on development contracts from large corporations and the sale of equity.  In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Energy Conversion shares closed at $19.75, up 50 cents. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0077': 'Further Regulation at Their Convention --- By Scott McMurray Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Futures exchanges, pressured on several fronts to improve policing and competitiveness of their markets, are expected to lobby hard against further regulation at this week\\'s Futures Industry Association convention.  Scores of regulators and lawmakers are expected to gather at the conference, beginning today in Boca Raton, Fla. Mounting pressure on the industry, including calls to reform trading practices in the pits and competitive threats from over-the-counter and overseas markets, will be hot topics, participants say.  Officials of the nation\\'s 10 futures exchanges in particular will contend in the informal discussions that characterize the session that further regulation of their business would hurt, rather than help, futures markets.  \"The appearance of the meeting is business as usual, but these guys are really embattled,\" said one futures exchange official. \"They\\'re going to be lying so low it\\'ll be as if they put designer sandbags around the Boca hotel.\"  One of the most controversial market events -- Friday\\'s triple-witching hour, when stock-index futures, options and individual stock options expire together at the close of trading -- will occur during the conference. The impact of stock-index futures and options on the stock market is being closely monitored by regulators. They have applauded moves by several exchanges to switch the quarterly expiration of their contracts to the start, rather than the close, of trading for the next expiration in June in an attempt to damp volatility.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, whose Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500 stock-index futures contract accounts for 75% of all stock-index futures trading, led the switch to the open at the urging of the New York Stock Exchange.  Many futures industry officials are watching to see if additional steps taken by the Chicago Merc recently to curb abuses in the S&amp;P pit also will be adopted by, or pressed upon, other futures exchanges. The Chicago Merc announced a package of reforms last week that, if adopted, will sharply restrict its S&amp;P 500 brokers from the industrywide practice of trading for their own as well as customer accounts.  Other exchanges have rushed to distance themselves from the proposal, claiming their markets aren\\'t in need of repair as is the teeming S&amp;P 500 pit. But officials fear privately that if restrictions on dual trading take root in the S&amp;P 500 pit, regulators or legislators will find it hard to resist applying such measures to other futures markets.  To reaffirm their ties with Washington, officials from the Chicago Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade met with influential Illinois legislators Thursday to discuss the needs of one of the state\\'s biggest industries. These and other futures exchanges are also major contributors to the political campaigns of these legislators, including Rep. Daniel Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who is scheduled to speak at the convention.  Exchange officials say that they are also trying to head off any attempt by legislators to try and apply to futures trading a proposal made by House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) to tax securities trades in order to fatten federal coffers.  Competition from futures and futureslike products traded off of exchange floors also is a major concern of futures markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Board of Trade have formed separate committees to study off-exchange trading.  The exchanges are also lobbying regulators to create a more \"level playing field\" of regulatory restrictions between themselves and foreign futures exchanges, which tend to be less regulated than their U.S. counterparts. The U.S. markets said they need less onerous regulations to better compete in what is increasingly becoming a global market for futures trading. ',\n",

The increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,851,000 units, followed a revised 0.5% decline in January to a 1,804,000-unit pace. The department previously said starts fell 0.1% in January. Starts ran at a rate of 1,945,000 units last April.  The report followed a pattern that many economists contend will persist for much of the year: strength in single-family construction partly offset by weakness in multifamily building. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted in a statement that \"this year should be the fifth solid year in a row for home building activity -- with single-family units stronger than multifamily units.\"  Last month, starts of single-family homes rose 5.6% to a 1,317,000-unit rate after rising 1.1% to a 1,247,000-unit pace the month before. Multifamily starts fell 4.1% to a 534,000-unit pace after declining 4% to a 557,000-unit rate.  James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, suggested that the gain in single-family construction reflected builders\\' efforts to have construction under way in anticipation of a strong spring selling season. Also, he said, current mortgage rates may be \"about the best we\\'re going to see for a while,\" although he doesn\\'t foresee a sharp rise.  Multifamily construction, economists generally agree, is being restrained by high vacancy rates in many areas and the elimination of tax-shelter incentives in the new tax law.  The gain in starts was sharpest in the South, where they rose 13.2% after a 2.8% drop in January. Starts increased 8.1% in the West after a 5.5% drop. In the Midwest they fell 6.4% after a 6.6% rise. In the Northeast they fell 13.2% after a 3.2% gain.  Building permits, considered a good indication of future activity, were issued at a 1,764,000 annual rate, up 4.4% from the Janaury rate of 1,690,000. Permits fell 11.5% in January. The rise was steepest in the Northeast, where starts increased 20.1% after a 4.1% drop the month before. Permits fell 7.3% in the West after a 38.6% decline.  Some of the regional variation may reflect unseasonal weather. Seasonal adjustment can be tricky in the winter months. ',\n",

The Minnesota officials said that they would turn the entire matter over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also investigating the company.  Executives for Endotronics, a Minneapolis-based biotechnology company, didn\\'t return repeated phone calls.  In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Endotronics closed at $1.625, down 62.5 cents.  As previously reported, Endotronics said Monday that Yamaha Inc., one of its distributors, has refused to pay about $3.7 million in overdue accounts receivable for the equipment. In addition, a shareholder suit filed earlier this month alleges that Endotronics hadn\\'t developed a viable market for its products in Japan. Endotronics\\'s 1986 annual report said sales of its cell-replication machines to Japanese distributors was its largest source of revenue.  According to the memo released by the Minnesota Commerce Department, Endotronics executives told agency officials that a majority of the instruments it sold to the Japanese distributors remain in U.S. warehouses. The Endotronics executives said, though, that the title on the equipment was transferred to the Japanese firms after it was shipped to the warehouses and that the equipment couldn\\'t be returned.  Michael Hatch, Minnesota Commerce Commissioner, said the department was trying to determine the location and ownership of the instruments purchased by the Japanese distributors.  The payment dispute with Yamaha will be a critical part of the investigation, he said. Specifically, the federal agencies will be examining how and why Yamaha withdrew a promissory note it had issued to Endotronics to pay for the equipment, Mr. Hatch said. Depending on the outcome, he said, \"some of Endotronics\\'s sales may not have been sales.\"  The investigation also centers on alleged short-selling \"through brokers who were at the same time talking the company down,\" Mr. Hatch said. The memo said investigators didn\\'t know whether the negative information caused the drop in Endotronics\\'s stock price, which traded as high as $23 a share during the past year.

Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN> The British pound surged more than 1% against major currencies in response to the British government\\'s new budget.  Sterling\\'s advance was especially significant, traders said, because it coincided with a drop in British interest rates following yesterday\\'s formal proposal of the fiscal 1988 budget. Lower interest rates tend to reduce demand for the currency.  \"You\\'d expect sterling to come down but it hasn\\'t,\" said Giles Tayelor, a trader at Barclays Bank International Ltd. in New York. \"That means sterling is fairly strong, and is likely to stay that way for a while.\"  The dollar was narrowly mixed in foreign exchange trading, as the din of sterling activity drowned out most other dealings.  In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6043, just shy of its intraday high and 1.1% above its Monday price of $1.5870. Sterling advanced similarly against the West German mark, the bellwether European currency, climbing to 2.9421 marks from 2.9106.  In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar inched up against the Japanese currency to 151.80 yen from 151.78 in New York Tuesday.  Partly in anticipation of Britain\\'s annual budget proposal, the pound generally strengthened in recent weeks. Traders were optimistic that the budget would call for tax cuts and reduced government borrowing, as it did.  But Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s budget deficit projection yesterday of the equivalent of $6.4 billion was sharply narrower than market estimates and the government\\'s earlier target.  Mr. Lawson also predicted economic growth of 3% this year, up from 2.5% in 1986.  \"The market views the budget as being fairly prudent, very positive,\" said Valerie J. Walker, head of the New York foreign-exchange advisory office of Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank. \"The prognosis for sterling as an investment currency looks fairly good,\" she said.  Although traders are optimistic about the pound, some caution that a rally might falter on a further drop in British banks\\' basic lending rate, which recently fell half a percentage point to 10 1/2%, selling tied to profit-taking or possible intervention by the Bank of England. The pound is \"not going to go roaring away. It\\'s just going to stay well bid,\" said Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker.  And Mr. Tayelor of Barclays advised: \"Expect sterling to stay at these levels or slightly better for some time.\"  In other foreign-exchange activity, the dollar eased to 1.8339 marks, from 1.8340, and firmed to 151.78 Japanese yen, from 151.55.  The dollar was lifted in midday trading by bullish interpretation of remarks by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Speaking before a House panel, Mr. Baker said last month\\'s agreement in Paris among the U.S. and its top five economic allies \"should foster more stability in exchange rates around their current values.\" He didn\\'t elaborate.  Traders said the comment indicates that Mr. Baker still endorses the three-week-old accord by the so-called group of six. The pact is widely believed to call for coordinated central-bank intervention to keep the dollar confined to a narrow range. Traders believe it is near the low end of the acceptable range.

But a U.S. trade official said that a \"first glance\" at the study indicates the Japanese aren\\'t complying, moving the two countries closer to a showdown.  The chip pact, signed last July, was designed to increase U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan and stop dumping -- selling below the cost of production -- in the U.S. and other countries.  In Tokyo, Japanese officials are becoming increasingly angry at the threat of U.S. trade sanctions. One high-level official said such action would \"only pour cold water\" on overall U.S.-Japan trade, and \"pick a fight\" with the Japanese. But officials are anxious to make concessions because Japan is so dependent on U.S. markets. Junji Yoshihara, deputy director of the powerful Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said the government is doing \"all it can\" to make chip producers live up to the agreement. \"To be told we aren\\'t doing anything is offensive,\" Mr. Yoshihara said.  Specifically, MITI said its latest survey shows that Japanese chip makers have slashed production by 23% this quarter from the previous period, an indication that chip prices may rise, providing U.S. companies with more sales opportunities. MITI said the companies are selling some types of chips abroad at prices 15% to 20% higher than U.S. and Korean competitors.  \"We\\'re doing everything just as MITI tells us to,\" said a Hitachi Ltd. official, \"and we\\'re praying there won\\'t be any sanctions.\"  MITI also said it is cracking down on the so-called gray-marketeers, small chip exporters who buy chips cheaply in Japan and use them to undersell U.S. producers elsewhere. The Japanese government can\\'t legally stop these traders from exporting the goods, but MITI said it\\'s now routinely holding up these exporters\\' license applications by asking detailed questions on such matters as the identity of the receiver of the exported chips and the size of the importers factory.  \"It\\'s not nearly as easy to export as it used to be,\" said an NEC Corp. executive.  On the issue of market access, MITI\\'s Mr. Yoshihara said the U.S. may just have to be more patient. MITI has set up an International Semiconductor Cooperation Center to help promote foreign chips in Japan, but U.S. industry data suggest the American share of the Japanese market has risen only marginally from the 8.2% level where it was when the pact was signed. \"We can\\'t do everything at once,\" said Mr. Yoshihara.  The Reagan administration\\'s Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet next week to decide what sanctions, if any, it will impose on certain Japanese chip makers. U.S. officials insist that any sanctions will be aimed solely at strengthening the agreement by forcing alleged Japanese violators to change their ways. That strategy indicates the U.S. will consider imposing penalties on other Japanese electronics imports that contain chips, rather than implementing dumping penalties on the chip makers themselves that would negate the pact.

       " 'WSJ870318-0063': 'Ventures Even Though Merger Is Ended --- By Brenton R. Schlender Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> Although Fujitsu Ltd. has dropped its controversial proposal to acquire Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., both companies still expect to carry out many of their plans to cooperate in semiconductor manufacturing through a series of joint ventures.  At a news conference scheduled for today, Donald W. Brooks, Fairchild\\'s president and chief executive officer, is expected to describe financial arrangements under negotiation for a leveraged buyout by management of Fairchild, a unit of Schlumberger Ltd., as well as other options the company is considering.  According to sources close to Fairchild, Mr. Brooks also is expected to announce that Fujitsu and Fairchild plan to move toward agreements for future technology development, joint manufacturing in both the U.S. and Japan, and exchange of manufacturing rights for new and existing products. All these ventures are based upon blueprints drawn up in recent months as Fujitsu awaited U.S. government approval to acquire Fairchild outright.  \"Plan one didn\\'t work, so we\\'re moving on to alternative plans for cooperation,\" said Ken Katashiba, vice president for cooperative ventures and spokesman for Fujitsu\\'s U.S. semiconductor operations. \"We have been working with Fairchild for months and are continuing to work with them,\" he added. \"We are still enthusiastic.\"  Fujitsu abruptly withdrew its offer -- estimated at $200 million to $225 million -- to purchase 80% of Fairchild, one of Silicon Valley\\'s pioneering companies, after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige and other U.S. officials voiced opposition to the merger, citing continuing trade friction with Japan and national-security considerations. Fujitsu said it had hoped to use Fairchild\\'s technological prowess and extensive sales infrastructure as a foundation for expanded operations in this country, as much to compete with other Japanese electronics giants doing business in the U.S. as to wrest business from American semiconductor companies.  \"Going through with the deal by force is not our way,\" said Mr. Katashiba. \"We don\\'t want to invest in a troubled U.S. company if it isn\\'t welcome.\"  The idea of joining forces through joint ventures between Japanese and U.S. chip companies isn\\'t new, and isn\\'t so controversial either. Last fall Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. announced sweeping agreements that would enable Motorola to make Toshiba\\'s big-selling memory chips, and would allow Toshiba to make many of Motorola\\'s popular microprocessor chips. National Semiconductor Corp. works closely with NMB Semiconductor Co., a Japanese concern, to design, make and sell chips in Japan, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has close ties to both European and Japanese chip companies.  The Reagan administration reacted cautiously to news of the possible Fujitsu-Fairchild joint ventures. A senior U.S. official said the administration still didn\\'t have enough information on the coming announcement to decide what action to take. But he hinted it probably wouldn\\'t challenge the companies\\' scaled-down plans. Washington had objected initially because an outright merger of the two companies would have placed all of Fairchild\\'s technology under Japanese ownership.  That Fujitsu might try to find other ways of accomplishing its plans for Fairchild didn\\'t surprise executives of other Japanese chip companies. \"It\\'s not like the Japanese to walk away from something like this,\" said an American executive of a Japanese chip maker. \"And I don\\'t think Fujitsu\\'s problems with the government poisons the atmosphere for getting together in other ways.\"  The main obstacle to the idea of consolidating through joint ventures is the ownership of Fairchild by New York-based Schlumberger, which in turn is controlled by French interests. Schlumberger, whose primary business is providing services to the slumping oil industry, is hard-pressed to continue supporting Fairchild, which itself was battered by the recent deep slump in the semiconductor industry. But until Fairchild\\'s ownership is settled, the company can\\'t move forward with joint ventures.  Fairchild would prefer to be separated from Schlumberger in a leveraged buyout by management so that it could proceed with the plans drawn up with Fujitsu. Mr. Katashiba of Fujitsu declined to comment whether Fujitsu is providing any of the financing for a possible leveraged buyout. Sources close to Fairchild, however, say the money for a buyout probably isn\\'t coming from Fujitsu, but from U.S. investors.  Some industry executives are still puzzled why Fujitsu so abruptly dropped its plans to purchase Fairchild from Schlumberger. While Commerce Secretary Baldrige made no secret of his opposition to the merger, other administration officials hadn\\'t yet made up their minds. Even Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had been described in some news reports as siding with Mr. Baldrige, issued a statement Friday denying that he had taken such a position. \"This case is still under review in this department,\" Mr. Weinberger said.  Indeed, other U.S. officials acknowledge that if the case had made its way to the Economic Policy Council, a cabinet-level body headed by Treasury Secretary James Baker, the votes could have split down the middle, or even gone in Fujitsu\\'s favor. Only U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and the Pentagon\\'s export-control office were known to be clearly in support of Mr. Baldrige\\'s position. The Treasury, which wants to keep the door open to foreign investment, leaned toward approving the merger, as did the State Department and the Office of Management and Budget, according to sources close to the companies.  U.S. trade officials concede that an outright rejection of the Fujitsu-Fairchild merger could have weakened the U.S. in its efforts to convince other countries to open their markets to foreign investment. It would be more difficult, for example, for the U.S. to continue to press Brazil to allow U.S. companies to invest in the Brazilian computer industry after saying no to Fujitsu.  The Commerce Department, however, insists that its stand on the Fujitsu-Fairchild merger doesn\\'t detract from the administration\\'s open-door policy. \"We\\'re only looking at where you could make an exception (to that policy) when vital national interests are at stake,\" said B.J. Cooper, a department spokesman.  Some Japanese businessmen in the U.S. agree that the government\\'s opposition to the Fujitsu-Fairchild merger won\\'t affect the tide of Japanese investment in U.S. technology firms. According to Norio Sugano, president of Fremont, Calif.-based Semix Inc., a distributor of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the only real significance of the Fujitsu-Fairchild merger was its notoriety, and that hundreds of smaller Japanese tie-ups to Silicon Valley companies should proceed quietly undisturbed.  \"Both nations\\' companies need access to each other\\'s markets,\" he said. \"Also, Japanese want U.S. technology and American companies need capital. They\\'re still very well suited for each other.\"  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Schlumberger shares closed at $39.375, up $2.  --- Eduardo Lachica and Art Pine contributed to this article.

Such talks among the Merc, the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and the Cotton Exchange never have made much headway. Still, \"it makes no sense to have four separate entities,\" Mr. Bradt said. \"There would be enormous cost savings\" in a merger, he said.  Mr. Bradt is a popular and ubiquitous figure at the exchange: He is on 11 Merc committees, including chairman of the business conduct committee and chairman and creator of the options committee. He is particularly pleased with the success of the exchange\\'s new options contract on crude-oil futures, which since its launching in October has been one of the most successful new options vehicles.  The Merc is the nation\\'s fastest growing futures exchange; last year\\'s trading volume doubled year-earlier activity.

Taft, increased its bid to acquire the broadcasting concern to more than $150 a share from $145 a share.  The group made the latest bid, valued at $1.38 billion, in a letter delivered yesterday to directors of Taft. In the letter, the bidders said they were \"committed to pursuing our acquisition of Taft Broadcasting.\" In addition to Mr. Taft and family members, the group includes Narragansett Capital Inc., a Providence, R.I.-based investment firm.  \"We would be prepared to negotiate a transaction in which the Taft Broadcasting shareholders would receive value in excess of $150 per share,\" said the group, which added that the sweetened offer hinges upon cooperation from Taft management.  The group argued in the letter that the broadcasting concern\\'s sale would \"provide a means of maximizing shareholder value.\" The group, citing, an \"unstable situation,\" contended that uncertainties about Taft\\'s future are distracting management from day-to-day responsibilities and \"will inevitably lead to a deterioration and weakening of the company.\"  Taft declined to comment on the latest proposal.  As previously reported, the company last week rejected a $145 a share takeover proposal by the investment group, calling it inadequate. Taft claimed the earlier offer, which was valued at $1.33 billion, failed to \"recognize fully\" the company\\'s future prospects.  In rejecting the earlier bid, Taft said its directors had instructed management to study alternatives, including a \"financial restructuring\" of the company.  Mr. Taft\\'s investment group, however, said it doubted that the broadcasting company could devise a restructuring \"that would assure greater after-tax value to the shareholders than a negotiated transaction with us.\" The group added that its bid \"will not remain open indefinitely.\"  The Taft family, one of the most prominent in Ohio, founded the company in 1929 and along with relatives holds 12% of its 9.2 million shares outstanding.

       " 'WSJ870318-0059': '--- By Douglas J. Basharov</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN> In recent weeks we have been bombarded by stories about the \"new consensus\" on welfare reform. There is one, but it is much shallower than most accounts suggest. And while there is a real opportunity for reform, there is also a great danger that the legislative process will produce only more of the same failed policies.  The new consensus revolves around the recognition that something must be done about long-term welfare dependency. About half of the new entrants to the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program will be off welfare within four years, generally within two, according to Harvard economist David Ellwood\\'s analysis of data from the University of Michigan\\'s Panel Study of Income Dynamics. They use government assistance as it is intended: as a temporary crutch until they can get back on their feet.  The other half, however, are on welfare for much longer -- on average, almost seven years. Moreover, nearly 25% of AFDC recipients stay on for 10 or more years.  From the left as well as the right, there is a growing concern about this form of poverty -- caused not by low income alone, but by an inability to cope. Too many people stay dependent on welfare through their own behavior, such as dropping out of school, having children out of wedlock, and failing to accept minimum-wage jobs.  This \"behavioral dependency\" is reflected in changes in family structure and labor-force participation, documented in a recent report of the nonpartisan, privately funded Working Seminar on the Family and American Welfare Policy:  --The concentration of black and Hispanic poor in \"high-poverty census tracts\" in the nation\\'s 100 largest cities (now totaling some 4.1 million people) grew almost 60% from 1970 to 1980.  --In such locations, female-headed families outnumber families headed by married couples 3 to 1, and the percentage of men with jobs is far below that of 25 years ago.  --Fewer than 7% of U.S. families headed by married couples have incomes below the official poverty line. But 34% of female-headed families are poor, and they have constituted the fastest-growing segment of the poor since 1965.  --The 3.4 million mothers on AFDC work much less than non-poor mothers. Forty percent of non-poor mothers with children under 18 worked full time for at least 40 weeks during 1984, compared with only 9% of AFDC mothers.  --Of the seven million children receiving AFDC in 1983, 46% were born out of wedlock.  --Children born out of wedlock, regardless of race or age of mother, are more likely to be low birthweight, to drop out of school, and to themselves have children out of wedlock.  --Only 13% of the working-age poor report as their reason for being unemployed that jobs are unavailable.  --Labor-force participation of young black males ages 16 to 24 has fallen dramatically since 1962, from 59% to 44%.  In analyzing computer tapes of the University of Michigan study, political scientist Charles Murray, author of \"Losing Ground,\" concluded: \"Those who do the following three simple things are unlikely to stay long in poverty: (1) complete high school; (2) get married and stay married; and (3) stay employed at a job, any job, even at first at the minimum wage.\"  Mr. Murray found that: --Only 4.7% of black male heads of household with just a high-school education were in poverty or near poverty by 1980.  --In the same year, among adult males of all races with just a high-school education, 91% had family incomes greater than twice the poverty level. Among adult black males, 86% had family incomes twice the poverty level.  Providing income-supports for people of low income is relatively straightforward, but helping the long-term dependent to adopt self-reliant behavior is far more difficult. The traditional solution of economic growth plus income supplements is not working well enough to diminish their dependency.  Central to the new consensus is the conclusion that it has been a mistake to offer welfare benefits without imposing on recipients the same obligations faced by other citizens to try to become self-sufficient through education, work and responsible family behavior. There is a renewed realization that government policy helps establish a moral climate -- that, properly directed, it can set goals of self-reliance for all citizens.  Workfare is the centerpiece of the new consensus. Liberals and conservatives have joined in agreeing that welfare recipients should be required to take part in work (or time-limited training programs) as a condition of receiving benefits. Young mothers should be required to complete high school (or its equivalent) and prepare for future employment; older mothers with previous work experience should be expected to find work in the private sector or (as a last resort) to accept assignment in the public sector. Even mothers with very young children should work, goes the new consensus. The idea is that education and work are necessary to develop sound habits of self-reliance. Gone is the concern that AFDC work mandates are a form of \"Slavefare,\" the phrase that so discredited similar efforts in the \\'60s and \\'70s.  The consensus about the need to impose obligations on welfare recipients is a historic opportunity to reduce behavioral dependency. Broad support for workfare \"reflects strong ideas about responsibilities and self-support, and at the same time is being implemented in many states on a basis that provides the support and assistance needed to motivate, prepare and assist welfare family heads to obtain employment,\" writes Richard Nathan, chairman of nonprofit Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., which designs, manages and studies demonstrations and social experiments aimed at increasing long-term self-sufficiency of the disadvantaged.  But there is a catch. Past federal job-training programs have not had impressive results, and the current wave of innovative workfare experiments have had only modest success. A recent General Accounting Office report on state workfare experiments concludes: \"Evaluations of the work programs have shown modest positive effects on the employment and earnings of participants. But wages were often insufficient to boost participants off welfare. Thus, programs should not be expected to produce massive reductions in welfare rolls.\"  Minimizing these disappointing results, some on the left are using the idea of obligation as a justification for a major expansion of welfare spending. Proposals to spend one, two or more billions are circulating on Capitol Hill. Others, on the right and the left, fear we may see a replay of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which after $60 billion spent between 1973 and 1984, was widely perceived as a local boondoggle of failed expectations. They have a point.  We should be wary of excessive eagerness to embrace workfare and similar programs as a panacea. H.L. Mencken is quoted as saying, \"For every human problem, there is a neat, clean solution -- it is always wrong.\" We do not yet know whether workfare falls within his warning, but we should take heed. Recent proposals, like that of a National Governor\\'s Association task force, to spend large amounts of additional money on workfare are, at best, premature.  Instead, we should adopt a step-by-step approach to workfare, securing sound successes and avoiding over-promising and disillusionment. Programs should be neither massive nor designed for swift results. Rather, they should be aimed at steady progress in increasing the proportions of the employable engaged in constructive work.  Moreover, in administering welfare, the principle of federalism should be maintained. There can be no single, national approach to workfare. Local conditions vary too much. Hence, state and local governments should be given great latitude to experiment with methods of reducing poverty and dependency. Rather than specifying programmatic details, federal rules should give states and localities a financial incentive to reap the benefits of moving the dependent from passive recipiency to productive work.  The opportunity for reform should not be misspent by overspending. As a national community, we cannot afford another failed effort at welfare reform.  --- Mr. Besharov is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870318-0057': '--- By John K. Clemons</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN> Second-guessing Wall Street\\'s insider-trading scandal has become a growth industry. Politicians claim the whole thing could have been prevented by tougher regulations. Economists blame the system. \"What do you expect,\" they ask, \"when arbitragers\\' returns routinely reach 35% to 50%? Pussycats?\"  Psychologists, too, are having a field day. They contend that the insatiable thirst for profit, the lavish life styles and the manipulation of the market are all products of (you guessed it) lousy childhoods.  Come on.  Things are simpler than that. It\\'s plain arrogance that has given Wall Street its biggest jolt in decades. The symptoms are easy to detect precisely because they are so inherently a part of human nature -- the \"we-are-so-powerful-we-can-do-anything\" syndrome combined with the naive belief that once on a roll, always on a roll. It\\'s an old story.  And it was told well by Sophocles, the fifth-century B.C. Greek playwright whose tragic characters illustrate the damage done by usurping authority, abusing power and lacking respect for others. Most important, they demonstrate that arrogance is downright bad business. Just change the names and places, and today\\'s Levines, Boeskys and Siegels become the tragic protagonists in his stories.  Ajax, for example, is \"top gun\" among the Greeks in the Trojan War. In battle, he is likened to a lion, and enemy soldiers are understandably awed. Sophocles revealed Ajax\\'s tragic flaw when Ajax is denied a promotion. The affront so rankles him that he seeks revenge by murdering the Greek leaders. But the gods intervene and turn him on the Greeks\\' livestock. After coming to his senses the next day, he is so overcome with shame that he kills himself.  Ajax\\'s crime is not that he slaughtered a few goats and sheep or attempted revenge on his unappreciative bosses. His real offense is arrogance. Early in the play the youthful Ajax, leaving home to join the Greek army, is offered some parting advice by his father: \"My son, seek victory in arms, but seek it always with the help of heaven.\" Ajax blusters, \"Father, with the help of gods even a weak man might win, but I, even without their aid, trust to bring glory within my grasp.\" Youthful boasting? Perhaps. But when, as an adult, Ajax brags even to the gods that he is omnipotent, it is unpardonable.  To the ancient Greeks, there was nothing unusual about this. The idea that the gods would slap down any mortal who became too powerful, rich or ambitious was part of their culture. \"The gods are accustomed to throw down whatever rises too high,\" said the Greek historian Herodotus. Words to Wall Street\\'s wise.  Shakespeare\\'s \"Macbeth\" is another story of arrogance, ambition and evil. As Thane of Glamis, Macbeth is the model young nobleman: brave and courageous, his king\\'s most glorious general. But arrogance is to get the better of him:  I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only  Vaulting ambition, which o\\'er leaps itself And falls on th\\' other -- .  When the king visits Macbeth\\'s castle, Macbeth sneaks into his bedchamber and stabs him. Macbeth is crowned king, but he is consumed by guilt. Experiencing gradual disintegration, he utters the lines that signal the futility of his existence:  Life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is a tale  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing.  Macbeth is finally beheaded by an avenging general.  Ajax and Macbeth dramatize clearly what\\'s happening on Wall Street: unbridled arrogance and ambition leading to inevitable falls. Like Ivan Boesky\\'s. His career began to self-destruct not when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of insider trading, but when, in 1985, he arrogantly told a crowd of adoring business students: \"Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.\" His is the all-too-common tale of a supersuccessful individual so contemptuous of others that he loses all sense of propriety. By the time he notices, it is too late.  Mr. Boesky -- whose prep-school education presumably included an introduction to Greek and Shakespearean tragedies -- may have been less surprised than others by his own downfall. Perhaps he remembered the line from Shakespeare\\'s \"Henry VIII\": \"Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition, by that sin fell the angels.\" And he knew that arrogance had infected him. Asked about his obsessive money making, he once said: \"It\\'s a sickness I have, in the face of which I am helpless.\" He had a premonition of the end. \"I can\\'t predict my demise,\" he told an interviewer, \"but I suspect it will occur abruptly.\"  That\\'s a tragic story. But the oldest in the world.  --- Mr. Clemons teaches management at Hartwick College and is co-author of \"The Classic Touch: Lessons in Leadership from Homer to Hemingway,\" to be published by Dow Jones-Irwin next month.

Holders approved the plan at the troubled bank holding company\\'s annual meeting here yesterday. As previously reported, the plan restructures about $100 million of Hawkeye\\'s debt by pledging virtually all of its $1.2 billion of assets to creditors. In addition, Hawkeye gave creditors 25% of its equity outstanding. Under certain circumstances, current holders\\' stake could end up being diluted by more than 80%.  Without the restructuring, Hawkeye had said it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, an action that many banking experts say would take years to clear up and could mean steep losses for holders and creditors. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate, protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts. Hawkeye, battered by bad farm loans, had a loss of $59 million for 1986.  However, the Fed is pressing a lawsuit filed last month that could nullify the elaborate plan, one of the most difficult bank restructurings worked out.  The Fed tried to block the closing of one of Hawkeye\\'s member banks, arguing that the holding company had the $1.2 million needed to keep the unit afloat and was obligated to funnel it into the unit. Hawkeye refused to do that, saying it didn\\'t have the money. State regulators ultimately closed the bank and sold it to Lincoln Savings Bank, Reinbeck, Iowa.  In court proceedings scheduled for March 31, the Fed is expected to press Hawkeye to pay the $1.2 million anyway. However, it is unclear how that can be done since the bank has already been sold. The payment apparently would throw Hawkeye into default of its restructured debt; creditors and lawyers say it would leave Hawkeye with virtually no choice but a potentially messy Chapter 11 filing.  In a written statement, Paul Dunlap, Hawkeye\\'s chief executive, called the shareholder vote a \"favorable step in the process of Hawkeye\\'s reorganization.\" He couldn\\'t be reached to comment beyond that.

Arbitrage-related program trades made in anticipation of this Friday\\'s triple-witching hour played a relatively minor role in yesterday\\'s trading, analysts said.  A greater-than-expected 2.6% increase in housing starts in February and a 4.4% increase in housing permits signaled healthy economic growth and gave the market a boost, said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Commodity Corp. in Chicago.  \"The economy is starting to react to lower interest rates,\" he added.  A jump in crude oil futures prices also aided the rally in stock-index futures, many of which are heavily weighted with oil stocks, analysts said.  Mr. Fredericks said that testimony from Treasury Secretary James Baker before the House Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee also was interpreted favorably by the stock-index futures market. Mr. Baker said that the dollar is likely to gain stability at current levels, ending the continued erosion of corporate export earnings.  Mr. Baker added that Japan has agreed to take steps to stimulate its economy, which is expected to lead to a pickup in U.S. economic activity.  Courtney Smith, head of futures trading and research at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York, said that March Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500 stock-index futures contracts for delivery Friday traded in a relatively narrow range with the underlying stock index.  Lacking a wide enough price spread to initiate arbitrage trades between the futures and the stocks, most program traders stood on the sidelines, or sold March contracts and bought June S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures, traders said.  At the close of trading Friday, stock-index futures, options and individual stock options expire concurrently.  In other commodity markets yesterday:  ENERGY: Oil futures prices rose to their highest levels in eight weeks on technical factors, analysts and traders said. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil contracts for April delivery rose 23 cents, to $18.87 a barrel; it was the fifth advance in the past six sessions. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also rose. Some traders bought futures contracts on the expectation that a weekly inventory report to be issued after the market closed yesterday would show a continuing decline in U.S. oil inventories, analysts and brokers said. After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell for the week ended Friday. Some traders suggested this could lead to further price gains. \"For now, the sentiment is still higher,\" said Richard Kane, energy trader for Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York.  COCOA: Futures prices rose again on increased prospects of a compromise settlement of questions about the management of cocoa buffer stocks. A working group of producing and consumer nations meeting in London was examining a draft compromise proposal last night, wire service reports from London said. The session preceded today\\'s start of formal negotiations on the buffer stock issues. One proposal in the draft called for the buffer stock manager to be open to offers, and hence free to buy various types of beans, reports said. Other proposed elements of a compromise reportedly would allow the manager to pay different prices for various types of cocoa, under an agreed formula and for the manager to limit cocoa from nonmember producers to no more than 10% of the buffer stock. Analysts said they understood the draft proposal had been accepted as a basis for the formal negotiations.  GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices were stronger on the heels of a higher-than-expected weekly export figure. Corn prices also were strenghtened on rumors that the Soviets purchased more U.S. corn last week and that Argentina may have exhausted its large exporting capabilities for the rest of its current marketing year, analysts said. Soybean prices rose in sympathy with the higher corn prices. Meal was buoyed by reports that meal stocks are low but demand is high, analysts said.  LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices rose as traders, who oversold contracts for distant delivery on expectations of a bearish cattle-on-feed report, returned to the market. The report, which the Agriculture Department released after the close, was in line with analysts\\' predictions. The April cattle contract was strengthened by expectations of tight beef supplies in the coming weeks because of aggressive sales for slaughter, analysts said. Pork belly prices were lower and hog futures rose in tandem with cattle contracts.  SUGAR: Futures prices rose and one analyst traced the firmness to an anticipated Egyptian tender to buy about 20,000 tons of refined sugar for prompt delivery. Egypt is expected to be offered the sugar at relatively high prices as has happened in previous tenders by other countries, particularly India, he said. The focus of attention was on the European Economic Community and its weekly tender to sell processed beet sugar today. Rumors continued that European producers would offer as much as one million tons of sugar into the EEC\\'s intervention fund. Some observers thought this might help support prices, but no one seemed quite sure, because of the complexity of the EEC\\'s sugar policy. One trade house official said the EEC has three alternatives to deal with such a large offer of sugar, but that each would be bearish for prices by varying degrees. The EEC could hold the sugar until next season, beginning Oct. 1, but that would mean the season would begin with a burdensome supply. It could negotiate for higher subsidies with producers, which would cause financial stress on the EEC and the sugar would eventually be sold through trade houses, anyway. A third option would be to accept the million tons and resell it into the market this season, which would severely depress prices, he said. He said the EEC would have three weeks from the time the sugar is offered to try to persuade producers from putting the sugar into the fund. ',\n",

As previously reported, the oil and gas concern defaulted in October on its $26.5 million of bank debt and its $3.2 million of 9% convertible subordinated debentures due 1994. The Wichita Falls, Texas-based company said the oil slump has left it strapped for cash.  Harry V. Allison, the company\\'s president, said restructuring discussions have been held with the banks since October and that the banks\\' latest restructuring offer is still being considered. But, Mr. Allison added, the latest offer is unlikely to be acceptable to Galaxy\\'s board.  The proposal \"leaves too much debt for what properties they\\'re proposing to leave us,\" he said. Mr. Allison declined to say what oil and gas properties the banks proposed to take, but said Galaxy would still be left with $6 million in debt. He said the company is holding discussions with several parties about restructuring alternatives.  According to Mr. Allison, the company has proved reserves of 4.2 million barrels of oil and 45.7 billion cubic feet of gas. As of Sept. 30, Galaxy had total assets of $51 million and liabilities of $41 million.  In the first nine months last year, Galaxy had a loss of $6.3 million, including a $4 million write-down, on revenue of $6.1 million.

The figures were disclosed in the FDIC's unaudited financial statement, approved by the agency's board yesterday. The FDIC insurance fund, which backs deposits of $1.5 trillion at 14,800 banks, had reserves of $18.2 billion on Dec. 31, according to the statement.  At the end of 1985, the insurance fund had a $1.4 billion surplus after a $1.6 billion provision for losses. It ended the year with reserves of $17.9 billion.  Last year, 138 federally insured banks failed, a post-Depression record. So far this year, 44 banks have failed, nearly double the number at the same time last year. FDIC officials, however, don't expect failures to continue at that rate, and Chairman William Seidman has predicted that as many as 150 banks could fail this year. \",\n",

The Mars missions are among several projects NASA is considering after the deployment of the space station in the mid-1990s. The options are being developed by astronaut Sally Ride for NASA administrator James Fletcher.  Other possibilities for the nation\\'s next long-term space goal include the establishment of a permanent scientific base on the moon, an intensive examination of Earth from space and expanded exploration of the solar system. Officials said a final decision hasn\\'t been made. One noted, however, that \"Mars is a hot item these days.\"  Whatever NASA\\'s decision, it faces daunting short-term problems. The cost of the space station, originally estimated at $8 billion, is now projected at more than $13 billion, according to some estimates.

       " 'WSJ870318-0046': 'Tender Offer Of $2.2 Billion --- Partnership Linked to AFG, Wagner &amp; Brown Bids $100 a Share for Concern --- By Michael Cieply Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) RUBBER (RUB) </IN> A partnership affiliated with AFG Industries Inc. and Wagner &amp; Brown launched a surprise tender offer to acquire GenCorp Inc. for $2.2 billion.  According to an advertisement in today\\'s Wall Street Journal, the partnership offered $100 a share for the 22.3 million GenCorp common shares outstanding.  A GenCorp spokesman said the company hasn\\'t had any discussions with a potential acquirer. The Akron, Ohio-based company is a major tire manufacturer and has interests in broadcasting, soft-drink bottling, and other businesses.  AFG is an Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker. Wagner &amp; Brown is a closely held oil and gas concern based in Midland, Texas. Officials at the two concerns couldn\\'t be reached for comment.  Last year, AFG and Wagner &amp; Brown offered $1.44 billion to acquire Lear Siegler Inc., but withdrew the offer in the face of higher bids and what the two companies called \"uncertainties\" about the new tax law. Lear Siegler, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based maker of aerospace, automotive, and other products, later was taken private in a $1.66 billion transaction.  It wasn\\'t immediately clear how the partnership plans to finance the GenCorp offer. According to the advertisement, the bid is contingent on the partnership\\'s ability to obtain financing and on clearances from the Federal Communications Commission to proceed with the offer pending application to acquire GenCorp\\'s broadcasting licenses.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GenCorp closed at $90.50 a share, up $2. Also on the Big Board, AFG closed at $41.25 a share, up 62.5 cents.  The tender offer expires at 12:01 a.m. EST April 15. According to the advertisement, the offer is made by General Acquisition Inc., a unit of General Partners. The partners making up General Partners are affiliates of AFG and Wagner &amp; Brown, according to the advertisement.  Randall D. Hubbard, AFG\\'s 51-year-old chairman, formed AFG in the late 1970s by acquiring a pair of troubled glass-making companies. He quickly turned the operations around and has since developed ambitions to become a takeover player in the mold of Carl Icahn and Irwin Jacobs, according to friends and business acquaintances.  Last year, AFG had net income of $21.1 million, or $2.11 a share, on revenue of $324.4 million. Mr. Hubbard owns about 19% of the company.  As previously reported, GenCorp earlier this month agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co. in a complex transaction under which Disney would pay more than $217 million to the Akron company and an additional $103 million to an investor group that has been challenging GenCorp\\'s license for the station.  \"We have a deal,\" a Disney spokesman said yesterday. \"We don\\'t think (the tender offer) will affect us.\"  GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell its New Jersey TV station, WOR, to MCA Inc. for $387 million.  According to the advertisement, the offer also is conditioned on GenCorp\\'s withdrawing proposed anti-takeover measures. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is manager for the offering, the ad said.  GenCorp, founded in 1915 and known for years as General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., has had a reputation as a loosely managed conglomerate. In addition to its original business, the company expanded over the years into such areas as soft-drink bottling, broadcasting and defense and industrial products.  Under A. William Reynolds, who was named chief executive officer in August 1985 and chairman a year later, GenCorp has focused its strategy on expanding its Aerojet General aerospace and defense unit and its DiversiTech General plastic products business.  For the year ended Nov. 30, 1986, GenCorp had earnings of $130 million, or $5.82 a share, on revenue of $3.1 billion.  Last month, GenCorp\\'s board adopted a rights distribution. The rights would enable GenCorp holders, in the event of a hostile takeover, to buy stock in the surviving company at half price. GenCorp said at the time of the rights-plan announcement that it wasn\\'t aware of any efforts to take over the company. GenCorp directors also have approved staggered terms for board members.  One problem any acquirer would face is resolving the challenges to the two television and 12 radio broadcast licenses GenCorp holds. Until the problem is resolved, the challenged licenses represent something of a built-in \"poison pill.\"  Some of the licenses have been challenged by parties who alleged that the company was an unfit license holder because it failed to inform the Federal Communications Commission about allegedly improper political contributions and foreign payments.  Wagner &amp; Brown, controlled by Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown, last year made an unsuccessful bid for Panhandle Eastern Corp., a Houston-based natural gas pipeline company. Before the Lear Siegler and Panhandle Eastern bids, Wagner &amp; Brown had been best known as a partner in takeover bids by T. Boone Pickens Jr.  There wasn\\'t any indication that Mr. Pickens and Wagner &amp; Brown are working together on the bid for GenCorp. A spokesman for Mesa Limited Partnership, of which Mr. Pickens is general partner, said, \"I haven\\'t even heard the name GenCorp for months.\"  --- J.

The Milwaukee-based company, the nation\\'s only motorcycle manufacturer, said it asked for an early end to the tariffs because it now is able to \"confidently\" compete with overseas manufacturers, particularly the Japanese.  \"We wanted to send out a message that American industry is alive and well, and that if you give us some breathing room we can survive and flourish,\" said James Paterson, vice president, marketing.  The ITC imposed the tariffs at the company\\'s urging. Harley had claimed its Japanese competitors were flooding the U.S. market with larger motorcycles with engine displacement of 700 cubic centimeters or more. The tariffs were to expire in April 1988.  Since the tariffs began, Harley has increased its overall U.S. market share of heavier motorcycles to 19.4%, or 32,000 motorcycles in 1986, from 12.5%, or 26,500 motorcycles in 1983, Mr. Paterson said. Those increases have come at a time when sales of larger motorcycles have been generally declining.

       " 'WSJ870318-0043': 'Bond Prices Gain on Increased Volume As Traders Shrug Off Rise in Oil Prices --- By Cynthia Crossen and Tom Herman Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN> Treasury bond prices staged a mild rally yesterday as trading volume perked up slightly.  The advance came despite another rise in oil prices, which many investors consider to be a gauge of inflationary pressure. Some analysts predicted that the higher oil prices will be short-lived and that inflation will remain moderate because of the economy\\'s persistent sluggishness.  Some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds gained about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate bonds also advanced, but municipals fell slightly.  Most short-term interest rates inched lower. For example, the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans of reserves, averaged just over 6%, after averaging 6 1/4% Monday.  Traders were encouraged by Treasury Secretary James Baker\\'s statement to a congressional subcommittee indicating satisfaction with the current level of the dollar in the foreign-exchange markets. Walter Dolde, a vice president of Citicorp Investment Bank, said Mr. Baker\\'s statement and the dollar\\'s recent stability \"ease concerns of foreign investors.\" Foreign investors have acquired huge amounts of U.S. Treasury securities in recent years, helping to absorb the government\\'s budget deficits.  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\\'s index of long-term Treasury bonds gained 2.23 points to close at 1427.32. It hovered between 1421.76 and 1429.58, a considerably wider range than in recent days.  Traders are also focusing on the details of a large Treasury refinancing operation, to be announced today. Robert H. Chandross, chief economist of Lloyds Bank in New York, estimated that the financing will consist of $10 billion of two-year notes, $7.75 billion of four-year notes and $7.25 billion of seven-year notes.  Late yesterday, two-year Treasury notes were yielding about 6 3/8%, while fouryear notes were yielding around 6.66% and seven-year notes about 7%.  The bond market got off to a weak start after the Commerce Department released a report showing a 2.6% rise in housing starts last month. That was slightly stronger than expected by many analysts. At one point early in the morning, the Treasury\\'s 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 traded as low as 99 19/32. But the issue later rebounded to close at 100 compared with 99 25/32 the previous day. That trimmed the yield to 7.5% from 7.52% Monday.  The government\\'s 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose slightly to 100 14/32 from 100 10/32 Monday. The yield fell to 7.19% from 7.2%.  Rates on short-term Treasury bills declined. The rate on the Treasury\\'s latest three-month bill fell to 5.55% bid from an average rate of 5.58% set at Monday\\'s government auction. The latest six-month Treasury bill also fell to 5.55% bid from an average of 5.58% Monday.  Many investment managers expect interest rates to move sideways in coming months mainly because they anticipate moderate economic growth with modest inflation. The Commerce Department today will issue a revised estimate of the economy\\'s growth in last year\\'s final quarter. Most analysts in several surveys expect the report to show little or no change from the anemic 1.3% annual growth rate previously estimated by the department.  Tomorrow the government will issue a report on personal income during February. According to the average of 14 analysts surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, personal income rose 0.8% last month, while personal consumption expenditures gained 1.6%. In January, personal income was flat, and personal consumption expenditures fell 2%.  Mr. Chandross of Lloyds Bank said he expects interest rates to hover close to their current levels, or possibly edge lower, during the next three months. He expects moderate economic growth in the U.S. \"I don\\'t think the second quarter is going to be any stronger than the first quarter, and it may even be weaker,\" he said. Moreover, he contended that the economies of many other leading industrial nations \"still are pretty weak,\" and that this could also help lead to lower world-wide borrowing costs.  In the municipal bond market, a $702.3 million offering of refunding bonds by the Intermountain Power Agency, Utah, was tentatively priced by underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Under the proposed scale, yields would range from 5.9% on bonds due 1996 to 7.29% on bonds due 2019.  Separately, underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. changed parts of a $165 million offering by the Suffolk County, N.Y., Southwest Sewer District. Yields now range from 3.9% on bonds due 1989 to 6.5% on those due 2005 to 2008. Under the preliminary scale, yields ranged from 3.6% in 1988 to 6.5% in 2007-2008. The bonds, which are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., are rated triple-A by both Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor\\'s Corp.  The Brazos River Authority, Texas, offered $100 million of 30-year revenue bonds for the Texas Utilities Electric Co. project. The 7.8% bonds were priced at par, according to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody\\'s and triple-B-plus by S&amp;P.  Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn., sold about $54.3 million of general obligation bonds. After an auction, an underwriting group led by Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. offered the bonds to investors at prices to yield from 3.75% on bonds due 1988 to 6.5% on bonds due 2006 and 2007.

       " 'WSJ870318-0042': 'To a New Procedure Involving Trade Data</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> The U.S. and Canada agreed to strengthen their trade-data collection procedures to deal with major discrepancies in external trade figures.  Canadian officials have expressed concern over the discrepancies because they have inflated the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada at a time when the U.S. Congress is considering various protectionist actions against countries that have big trade surpluses with the U.S.  Statistics Canada, a government agency that compiles Canada\\'s trade data, attributed the discrepancies partly to a tendency of U.S. truckers not to file export declarations with U.S. Customs when they cross into Canada.  Under the U.S.-Canadian agreement, the two countries next January will start to use each other\\'s import records as the basis for tabulating their exports. Import records are usually much more accurate than those of exports because imports are closely checked for tariff purposes.  Ivan Fellegi, chief statistician at Statistics Canada, said the agreement was an important \"breakthrough\" for trade-data reporting.  The discrepancies in trade statistics were particularly pronounced in the two countries\\' reports of their 1986 trade. The U.S. Commerce Department reported a 1986 U.S. trade deficit of $23.3 billion (U.S.) in trade with Canada. Statistics Canada reported a 1986 Canadian surplus equivalent to $11.3 billion in trade with the U.S. Statistics Canada said that, in theory at least, the U.S figure for its deficit with Canada should equal the Canadian figure of its surplus with the U.S. ',\n",

Detective Collins said it is fortunate that police didn\\'t mistake the real Mr. Nelson, of Vero Beach, for the suspect. \"They look a lot alike. . . . He could have spent quite a bit of time sitting in jail trying to convince us he was the wrong guy.\"  Mr. Nelson said he worked with Mr. Liszewski at First Source Bank in South Bend sometime between 1981 and 1983.

       " 'WSJ870318-0040': 'For New Securities Rules</HL> The American public is divided over whether Wall Street\\'s spreading insider-trading scandal warrants more government regulation of the financial industry.  A Wall Street Journal/NBC News telephone poll of 1,198 individuals nationwide last Thursday found that 44% supported more government regulation, 38% opposed it and 18% weren\\'t sure. The respondents were asked: \"Given what you know about insider trading on Wall Street, do you think the federal government should do more to regulate the financial industry, or do you think further government regulations would hurt the stock market\\'s ability to operate efficiently?\"  Among those respondents who said they\\'d heard or read about the insider-trading scandal, 50% supported more regulation, 41% opposed it and 9% weren\\'t sure. But among respondents who weren\\'t aware of the scandal -- 43% of the sample -- 36% supported more regulation, an equal number opposed it and 28% weren\\'t sure.  On another current financial issue, 79% of the respondents favored restriction of foreigners\\' equity investment here and only 16% thought foreigners should be allowed to buy as much stock as they want in U.S. firms.  And, asked about a proposed federal tax on securities sales, half the respondents opposed such a measure, while 34% favored it. Among investor respondents, 66% were opposed and only 26% were in favor; among non-investors, the tally was 41% against, 39% in favor.  Chances are 19 of 20 that if all U.S. households with telephones had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the results would differ from the poll findings by no more than three percentage points in either direction.

       " 'WSJ870318-0039': 'Amid a Battle Over Economic Policy --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</HL> Brazilian Planning Minister Joao Sayad resigned yesterday amid a battle over economic policy with Finance Minister Dilson Funaro.  Mr. Sayad\\'s resignation came a day after Mr. Funaro, the chief architect of Brazil\\'s current economic policy, denied publicly that the government was considering a wage-and-price freeze sought by Mr. Sayad.  \"I gave President {Jose} Sarney my resignation because I think my mission is over,\" Mr. Sayad said. \"I produced a plan for {economic} stabilization which was open to criticism. I think it is essential that this or some other plan be discussed by the government.\"  It was the first cabinet crisis since Brazil on Feb. 20 suspended interest payments on an estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt. A few days later, it froze another $15 billion of foreign trade credits and money-market deposits. There has been growing pressure since then on the Brazilian government to produce measures to shore up flagging domestic confidence in the economy, according to New York bankers.  The resignation of Mr. Sayad, a Yale-trained economist, leaves Mr. Funaro in undisputed control of economic policy but also more exposed to any failure. \"Another one drops away,\" commented one U.S. banker, recalling the recent resignations of several other senior Brazilian government officials, including the central bank governor, Fernao Bracher. With Mr. Sayad\\'s departure, all the economists who were architects of the Cruzado anti-inflation plan have now left government office.  The Brazilian ambassador to the U.S., Marcilio Marques Moreira, said late yesterday that he had no comment on Mr. Sayad\\'s resignation.  Mr. Sayad had been the planning minister since Brazil returned to civilian rule two years ago. On Monday, Ulysses Guimaraes, the president of Brazil\\'s largest political party, criticized Mr. Sayad for allowing details of an economic recovery plan to leak to the press.  The so-called \"Sayad Plan,\" details of which had been published in Brazilian newspapers over the past few days, had called for a 90-day price freeze, to be imposed starting June 1, an end to inflation-linked wage increases and an end to government subsidies.  Irritated at the daily leaks of excerpts of Mr. Sayad\\'s plan, Mr. Funaro on Monday told a group of 200 businessmen that a price freeze wasn\\'t under consideration.  Mr. Funaro\\'s recent trip to each of the major industrialized nations to muster a new approach to international debt hasn\\'t yet produced the results his staff had hoped for, bankers in New York said.  Meanwhile, the Planning Ministry and the Finance Ministry each have been working on their own new economic plans. This has led to tension and clashes between the two ministries, U.S. bankers said.

       " 'WSJ870318-0037': 'For AM General Unit, Sources Say --- By Cynthia F. Mitchell Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> General Automotive Corp. has proposed to buy LTV Corp.\\'s AM General division, which makes military vehicles -- the only tarnished spot on LTV\\'s otherwise lustrous aerospace and defense unit.  Sources familiar with the proposal said Cruse W. Moss, chairman and chief executive officer of closely held General Automotive, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based bus maker, has approached Raymond A. Hay, LTV\\'s chairman, president and chief executive, and other top LTV executives with a purchase offer. But the sources said Mr. Hay so far has rebuffed Mr. Moss, who was president of AM General until 1980. LTV purchased the unit from American Motors Corp. in 1983 for $170 million.  An LTV spokesman said Messrs. Moss and Hay \"have talked previously\" but he repeatedly denied that the two have ever discussed any proposals concerning AM General. \"There\\'s absolutely no truth to it,\" he said. \"LTV has no intention to sell AM General and we have not been approached by a buyer.\"  Mr. Moss was out of town yesterday and couldn\\'t be reached for comment. He didn\\'t return earlier phone calls seeking comment on the reports.  But sources close to AM General and Mr. Moss said he is suggesting a $60 million price tag for the division, which had 1986 sales of $700 million, or 9.6% of LTV\\'s total sales of $7.3 billion. The division has failed to receive several big competitive contracts over the past two years, and it posted a 1986 operating loss, which LTV didn\\'t specify. Last year, LTV took $175 million in charges related to the division.  The big steel, aerospace and energy concern filed last July for protection from creditors\\' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. LTV has had $4.69 billion in losses over the past five years, mostly from its beleaguered steel unit, the nation\\'s second largest. LTV plans to reorganize around its aerospace and defense unit, its only profitable line, which accounted for almost two-thirds of LTV\\'s 1986 operating profit of $171.9 million.  The sources said Mr. Moss probably will persist in seeking AM General but may lie low for a while. \"He really wants to be in that business,\" one source said. At White Motor Corp., where Mr. Moss worked after leaving AM General, he tried unsuccessfully to get the Army contract for its M-939 five-ton military trucks.  Last year, Mr. Moss tried again, and basically succeeded in wresting from AM General the $1 billion contract, which represented about half of the division\\'s business. A joint venture he formed with York, Pa.-based Harsco Corp.\\'s BMY division, which makes and overhauls armored vehicles, received the contract. But BMY President Ralph Cordes said his company bought out General Automotive\\'s interest before the contract was awarded.  Industry executives said they believe Mr. Moss, known for his shrewd bidding abilities, would be a stiff competitor for AM General\\'s only remaining major contract, the Army\\'s Hummer land vehicle, which is expected to be reopened for bidding this year.  While the sale of LTV\\'s entire aerospace and defense unit as part of any reorganization would be hard-fought by many parties to the bankruptcy-law proceedings, a fair offer for AM General alone probably wouldn\\'t bring many objections. Some creditors concede privately they would press for the sale if LTV were to turn down a fair price. LTV says it wants to keep the unit because it believes foreign sales of the five-ton trucks are rebounding. Last week, AM General received a contract from Pakistan for $18.5 million of the vehicles.

Attorneys for the House and Senate investigative committees met privately yesterday with a representative of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced after the two panels meet separately this morning.  A formal vote on immunity for Adm. Poindexter isn\\'t expected today, but the proposed compromise underscores his importance in the inquiry. He is believed to have intimate knowledge of U.S. arms sales to Iran and of Reagan administration efforts to funnel aid to Nicaraguan insurgents. As national security adviser, Adm. Poindexter had direct access to President Reagan. The Senate committee, in particular, has put a high priority on securing Adm. Poindexter\\'s testimony.  Adm. Poindexter, invoking the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so far has refused to testify on the affair. Yesterday, he again refused to testify when called by a House Government Operations subcommittee, which is investigating administration efforts to restrict public access to sensitive information in federal computer systems.  Mr. Walsh has been urging the committees to wait 90 days before giving Adm. Poindexter immunity. He is concerned that too early a grant of immunity could jeopardize his criminal investigation. Under the committees\\' plan to grant \"use\" immunity, Mr. Walsh couldn\\'t use any information contained in Adm. Poindexter\\'s testimony as evidence against the former national security adviser unless he could show he got the information elsewhere.  Under the tentative compromise, a vote on immunity would come in late April. To meet Mr. Walsh\\'s concerns, any resulting public testimony by Adm. Poindexter would be delayed until at least June 10. But congressional investigators would be able to move ahead with their inquiries by conducting private interviews with the admiral in May. The success of the compromise depends on all sides keeping this preliminary testimony from public disclosure.  The congressional committees also appear certain to grant limited immunity to Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the former National Security Council aide who was fired for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. But under the tentative agreement, lawmakers wouldn\\'t decide the matter until June. That timetable also assures Mr. Walsh of the 90-day delay he sought for his inquiry.  For Congress, the greater priority has been to get Adm. Poindexter to testify.  Neither panel appears inclined to extend immunity to compel the testimony of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who was active in facilitating U.S. weapon shipments to Iran and in the sale of arms to the Nicaraguan Contras. But the committees are expected today to consider granting immunity to several less important figures in the private arms network that the general supervised with Col. North.  Among these are Robert Owen, who is believed to have been an important liaison for Col. North with the Contra supply operation, and Richard Gadd, a retired Air Force officer who was an important associate of Gen. Secord. A third person expected to receive immunity is Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl, a former aide to Col. North at the NSC.  Separately, investigators are pursuing possible connections between Col. North\\'s operations and a British company, KMS Ltd., made up of former members of Britain\\'s elite Special Air Services (SAS). KMS has been hired by the government of Sri Lanka to train forces in anti-guerrilla warfare. According to special-operations veterans, the company has a long history as a clandestine operator in the Mideast and Africa.  A chart found among Col. North\\'s papers identifies a series of corporations that played a role in funneling money and arms to Nicaraguan insurgents. Among these is one labeled \"KMS.\" ',\n",

He added that the discount retailer isn\\'t under \"pressure\" to sell any of its Kresge stores. The chain is profitable, though K mart wouldn\\'t say how profitable, nor would it provide details of the talks with Woolworth.  In New York, a Woolworth spokesman acknowledged that the retailer had been interested in acquiring a few Kresge stores. \"The deal just didn\\'t jell,\" he said, adding that there aren\\'t any prospects of the talks being reopened in the near future.  The five-and-dime Kresges were once the core of K mart.

The fact that the talks took place came as a surprise to some securities analysts who follow K mart. But the discussions were viewed as a positive sign by some analysts.  \"I look at it as favorable\" for K mart, said Linda Morris of Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, who added that any shedding of Kresge stores would help the company continue focusing on discount and specialty retailing. K mart, for example, recently closed its off-price Designer Depot stores and sold its cafeterias. It is expanding other operations, such as its Pay Less Drug Stores unit.  \"There isn\\'t any real growth left\" in Kresge, added John Huebner, an analyst with First Manhattan Co. \"It\\'s a question of maximizing their return.\"  K mart shares closed yesterday at $61.50, off 25 cents, and Woolworth at $46.50, off 75 cents, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

The airlines are meeting here at the behest of the Transportation Department, which is pushing them to move flights from congested times to less-busy periods. Delays surged at major airports last year, and the department says that airline schedules are a major factor -- a contention disputed by the carriers.  Most of yesterday\\'s session was spent on Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield International Airport, where carriers agreed to a total of 127 schedule changes. Eastern Airlines and its commuter airlines agreed to move 66 flights, while Delta Air Lines and its commuter airline changed 59 flights. Excluding the commuters\\' changes, Eastern made twice as many changes as Delta. Trans World Airlines moved two flights.  Despite the revisions, flights at the Atlanta airport remain crowded at many times throughout the day, according to Federal Aviation Administration officials, who are overseeing the talks. \"We aren\\'t there yet, folks,\" Edward Faberman, the agency\\'s deputy chief counsel, told the airlines\\' representatives late yesterday afternoon.  The FAA is aiming for a maximum of 37 operations -- landings or takeoffs -- for each 15-minute period at Atlanta. But at the end of yesterday\\'s session, operations exceeded that limit in more than a dozen 15-minute periods throughout the day.  Schedules at Atlanta will be taken up again today. The talks next will turn to Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare International Airport, where carriers already have agreed to make 33 changes; FAA officials want 20 or 30 more. The discussions, which are expected to last through tomorrow, also will focus on Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

Coastal wants to acquire TransAmerican through a reorganization plan it will submit as part of TransAmerican\\'s current Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court case. TransAmerican sued in a Texas state court, however, accusing Coastal of trying to \"steal\" its assets by interfering with agreements it had reached with major creditors.  Details of Coastal\\'s plans emerged as litigation between the companies intensified. In an effort to rein in the warring companies, Bankruptcy Judge Manuel Leal ruled that he would have sole jurisdiction over the entire bankruptcy-law case. The judge\\'s ruling blocks TransAmerican\\'s effort in a state court here to derail Coastal\\'s efforts to negotiate with creditors and develop its own reorganization plan for TransAmerican.  Judge Leal\\'s ruling permitted TransAmerican, however, to pursue the $2 billion damages claim against Coastal in a Texas state court -- so long as it doesn\\'t interfere with the bankruptcy-court proceedings. \"I\\'m not going to interfere with a state court, as long as they don\\'t interfere with me,\" he said.  TransAmerican is the major operating unit of closely held GHR Energy Corp., which filed for bankruptcy-court protection in 1983 owing creditors about $1 billion. Coastal, an oil and gas producer and marketer, said it has the right to propose a reorganization plan because it is a TransAmerican creditor, although one with only $623,327 in claims outstanding.  The plan outlined by Coastal, a company noted for ingenuity and aggressiveness, would appear to give Coastal control of TransAmerican\\'s vast reserves with no immediate cash outlay. \"It is an obvious attempt to steal the assets on Coastal\\'s behalf,\" John Nabors, an attorney representing TransAmerican, told the bankruptcy court. Yet Coastal said the plan would benefit TransAmerican\\'s creditors far more than TransAmerican\\'s pending plan. In the pending plan, major creditors have agreed to accept $200 million in debt concessions in exchange for payment of the rest of their claims over 10 years.  In a preliminary outline of Coastal\\'s plan disclosed in court filings, Coastal proposed to buy all of TransAmerican\\'s properties excluding the huge GHR oil refinery at Good Hope, La., which has been closed for several years. Coastal would share revenue from TransAmerican\\'s properties with creditors until their loans are repaid, including interest. Most of the revenue from existing wells would go to creditors, while Coastal would receive most of the revenue from new wells drilled on TransAmerican acreage. After creditors are repaid, Coastal would share revenue with TransAmerican\\'s shareholders.  In its proposal, Coastal indicated it would spend as much as $375 million drilling development wells adjacent to existing production. Additional money would be spent drilling wildcat wells on unexplored acreage, Coastal said.  Coastal said that far from interfering with the bankruptcy case, its efforts to offer an alternative plan are entirely proper. \"We seek only the right to propose our plan, send it to creditors, and let them vote on it,\" said D.J. Baker, a lawyer representing Coastal. He alleged that TransAmerican was interested in protecting management and the company\\'s owner, John Stanley. By suing Coastal, TransAmerican was attempting to \"bludgeon, with multibillion dollar threats, anyone who gets in the way.\"  TransAmerican claimed, however, that Coastal was improperly trying to persuade creditors to drop agreements they already had made. In its suit, the company said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a major creditor, already was \"reevaluating\" its support of TransAmerican\\'s plan.  Besides the FDIC, which obtained its loans as part of the rescue package for Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Corp., TransAmerican\\'s creditors include the Banque Paribas unit of Cie.

Tandon, which has reported big losses in recent quarters as it shifted its product emphasis from disk drives to personal computer systems, asserts that the new device, called Personal Data Pac, could change the way software is sold, and even the way computers are used. The company, based in Moorpark, Calif., also will unveil a new personal computer compatible with International Business Machines Corp.\\'s PC-AT advanced personal computer that incorporates the new portable hard-disks.  \"It\\'s an idea we\\'ve been working on for several years,\" said Chuck Peddle, president of Tandon\\'s computer systems division. \"As the price of hard disks kept coming down, we realized that if we could make them portable, the floppy disk drive would be a useless accessory. Later, we realized it could change the way people use their computers.\"  Each Data Pac cartridge, which will be priced at about $400, is about the size of a thick paperback book and contains a hard-disk drive that can hold 30 million pieces of information, or the equivalent of about four Bibles. To use the Data Pacs, they must be plugged into a cabinet called the Ad-Pac 2. That device, to be priced at about $500, contains circuitry to connect the cartridge to an IBM-compatible personal computer, and holds the cartridge steadily in place. The cartridges, which weigh about two pounds, are so durable they can be dropped on the floor without being damaged.  Tandon developed the portable cartridge in conjunction with Xerox Corp., which supplied much of the research and development funding. Tandon also said it is negotiating with several other personal computer makers, which weren\\'t identified, to incorporate the cartridges into their own designs.  Mr. Peddle, who is credited with inventing Commodore International Ltd.\\'s Pet personal computer in the late 1970s, one of the first personal computers, said the Data Pac will enable personal computer users to carry sensitive data with them or lock it away. Also, he said Data Pac will make it easier to make duplicate, backup copies of all of the software and data stored in a personal computer. Mr. Peddle also suggested that software retailers might find it easier to sell software that can be copied from the store\\'s master copy right onto the Data Pac, thus eliminating the need to carry large inventories.  \"I don\\'t think the Data Pac will change the whole computer industry,\" as Tandon might suggest, said Stewart Alsop, editor and publisher of PC Letter, a newsletter that covers the personal computer industry. Nevertheless, he said, \"it\\'s an interesting product.\"  Tandon\\'s new personal computer, the PAC 286, will include a monitor, a keyboard, one floppy-disk drive, one Data Pac and one megabyte of memory, for a price of about $3,000.

The lawsuit, filed in federal district court here, also asks the court to vindicate the company\\'s recently adopted shareholder rights plan, which was established as an anti-takeover move.  Clark, a truck manufacturer, accused the plaintiffs -- Arthur Goldberg, president of International Controls Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., and other members of the investor group -- of having a \"plan or scheme to acquire control of Clark through use of fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative means.\"  The suit specifically charges the Goldberg group with trying to extract greenmail from Clark. It also accuses Mr. Goldberg of having a history of practicing \"greenmail.\" Greenmail occurs when a company buys back an investor\\'s stock at a premium, often under the threat of a takeover.  Also named in the suit were Earle and William Mack, who were identified as New Jersey residents and members of Mr. Goldberg\\'s group.  Earlier this week, Clark said Mr. Goldberg approached the company through First Boston Corp., its investment banker, in an attempt to sell back his 1.2 million shares. Negotiations, however, were unsuccessful.  In an interview, Mr. Goldberg said his offer to sell back the shares was made in reaction to Clark\\'s announcement last week that it planned to buy back as many as three million of its 18.8 million common shares outstanding.  Mr. Goldberg said he rejected Clark\\'s first two proposals to buy back his shares. A third proposal was rejected on \"nonmonetary grounds\" he said. Both Mr. Goldberg and Clark declined to say how much Clark offered for the shares.  Mentioned in the suit are a litany of transactions that Mr. Goldberg has been involved in, including a proposed leveraged buyout of Great Lakes International Inc. in 1984. The suit charges that Mr. Goldberg threatened that company with the buyout and made $3 million from greenmail as a result.  Mr. Goldberg, however, described the Great Lakes situation as a friendly transaction. \"I\\'m far from a corporate raider,\" he said. \"Tell me how a little guy like me could pressure a one-and-a-half-billion dollar company like Clark?\"  Among other charges, the suit also accuses Mr. Goldberg\\'s group of attempting to further its takeover aims by selectively supplying significant, nonpublic information about a planned tender offer for Clark to \"market professionals\" not interested in the company\\'s long-term interests. In the suit, Clark also asked the court to order the group to divest itself of its holdings.

Yesterday\\'s rally took many traders and analysts by surprise, since most had expected institutional investors to stay out of the market this week to avoid the wild price gyrations that often accompany the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and individual stock options. March contracts in all three categories will expire Friday afternoon.  Volume on the Big Board rose to 177.3 million shares from 134.9 million Monday as gainers swamped decliners by a 2-to-1 margin.  Secondary stocks, such as those traded in the over-the-counter market and at the American Stock Exchange, also participated in yesterday\\'s rally. The Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 3.93 to a record 434.79 as volume expanded to 153.9 million shares from 131.3 million Monday. There were 1,366 issues advancing and 955 declining. The American Stock Exchange\\'s Market Value index rose 4.06 to a record 335.24.  Traders\\' reaction to a somewhat larger than expected 2.6% rise in housing starts last month along with a 4.4% increase in building permits, which usually are seen as a precursor of construction activity, contributed to the stock market rally. However, as expected, commercial construction figures remained soft as developers continued to adjust to the tighter real estate provisions of the new tax law.  Interest rates declined slightly, despite the continued rise in oil prices. Bond market traders were betting that the oil price rally will be short-lived and they remained somewhat skeptical about the health of the economy. They also took comfort in comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker, who said a recent meeting of big industrialized nations \"should foster more stability in exchange rates around their current values.\"  The oil stock rally that began quietly Monday afternoon exploded yesterday. Among the gainers were Exxon, up 2 1/4 to 84 3/8; Standard Oil, up 2 1/2 to 64 3/8; Atlantic Richfield, up 3 1/2 to 78 3/4; Chevron, up 1 3/4 to 55 1/2; Pennzoil, up 3 to 81 3/4; Texaco, up 7/8 to 35; British Petroleum, up 1 5/8 to 54; and Royal Dutch Petroleum, up 2 3/8 to 114 7/8.  The recent gains in crude oil prices have been fueled by increasing signs that OPEC is holding down oil production. Sanford Margoshes, an oil industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, added that oil inventories are being drawn down without depressing prices.  Barry Good, who follows the oil industry at Morgan Stanley, said \"it looks like we have a buying panic\" in the oil stocks. He said that these stocks aren\\'t widely owned by many portfolio managers. So, any money manager who hopes to beat the performance of the S&amp;P 500 and all the portfolios that are patterned on this index will have to buy some of these shares pretty quickly.  Yet, he believes that many investors are focusing on OPEC and have lost sight of the dismal earnings prospects that many of the integrated oil companies face in the first half of this year. While crude oil prices are rising, he said prices for natural gas, which many of these companies also produce, have hardly moved recently. He worries that based on 1987 estimated earnings, both domestic and international oil companies are overvalued right now. \"What bothers me is that (investors) try to come up with some fundamental to justify the stock prices,\" he added.  Ashland Oil illustrates the difficult outlook to which Mr. Good referred. The stock slid 2 1/4 to 64 in reaction to the company\\'s statement late Monday that it expects a loss from operations in its second quarter ending March 31. Ashland, the nation\\'s largest independent oil refiner, earned $1.12 a share from operations a year earlier.  Du Pont rose 4 1/4 to 111 3/4. The company, which owns Conoco, said it knew of no specific reason for the price gain. But it noted that the stock seems to be trading as an oil issue. USX, which owns Marathon Oil, rose 5/8 to 26 5/8 on more than 2.2 million shares.  The stocks of oil service companies moved right along with the oil producers. Halliburton rose 3 to 34 5/8, Dresser International gained 7/8 to 27 7/8, Schlumberger rose 2 to 39 3/8, Baker International added 1 5/8 to 17 3/8, and Hughes Tool gained 1 1/2 to 13 3/4.  Airline stocks, usually hurt by the higher cost of energy, were spared a beating. Some registered minor gains, while USAir fell 1 to 44 1/4.  Drug stocks were generally higher, with Merck up 5 1/8 to 160 3/8, Squibb up 3 1/2 to 159 1/2, and Eli Lilly up 1 3/8 to 95 7/8. Upjohn fell 2 1/2 to 132 3/4. Some analysts reacted negatively to a government panel\\'s qualified recommendation for Upjohn\\'s anti-baldness drug.  F.W. Woolworth slid 3/4 to 46 1/2. K mart said it plans to continue operating its Kresge chain rather than sell the unit to Woolworth.  AmeriTrust Corp. soared 4 7/8 to 51 in OTC trading. A group led by Equitable Bancorp. Chairman Alfred Lerner said it holds a 9.6% stake in the company.  Another OTC issue, Sterling Inc., fell 2 to 20 1/4. The company reported higher fourth-quarter net but also announced plans for an offering of 1.5 million shares. Included will be 500,000 shares to be sold by certain stockholders, primarily members of the investor group that acquired the retail jewelry store chain in a June 1985 leveraged buyout.  Taft Broadcasting rose 3 1/8 to 156. Early yesterday an investment group headed by Taft\\'s vice chairman, Dudley S. Taft, sweetened its bid to acquire the company to \"in excess of $150 a share\" from $145 a share. Taft had rejected the $145-a-share bid last week.  Turner Broadcasting slipped 1/8 to 21 7/8. Time Inc. said it\\'s negotiating to join an investor group that is buying a 35% stake in Turner. Time was unchanged at 88 1/8.  Caesars World was unchanged at 29 1/2 on volume of nearly a million shares. The company has filed a lawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp., which launched an unsolicited $28-a-share tender offer for Caesars World last week. Among other things, the suit alleges that the offering is illusory and designed to manipulate the market in Caesars stock to enable Mr. Sosnoff to sell the Caesars shares he already owns at a profit.

       " 'WSJ870318-0025': \"SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Israel G. Grossman, a New York lawyer, was indicted on 24 felony counts related to an insider-trading scheme he allegedly organized while he was an associate at Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel.  Mr. Grossman, 34 years old, was arrested last month on charges that he leaked advanced word of Colt Industries Inc.'s 1986 recapitalization plan to six relatives and friends, helping them make $1.5 million in illegal profits.  The indictment handed up yesterday in Manhattan federal court charges Mr. Grossman with 12 counts of mail fraud and 12 counts of securities fraud. If convicted on all counts, he would face a maximum sentence of 120 years in jail and fines totaling $6 million.  Mr. Grossman, who is to be arraigned on the charges March 26, resigned from the Wall Street law firm Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn after his arrest there Feb. 17. He joined Carter Ledyard in October 1986.  Colt's pension-plan trustees had retained Kramer Levin to advise them in connection with the $1.5 billion recapitalization.  The indictment charges Mr. Grossman with mail and securities fraud in connection with 12 purchases of Colt call options by three of the individuals allegedly telephoned by Mr. Grossman: his uncle, George Hirshberg; a cousin, Walter Herzberg; and Norman Stein, whom the Securities and Exchange Commission described as a friend of Mr. Grossman's. The government claims that while Mr. Grossman worked at Kramer Levin he made more than 40 phone calls from his office to his relatives and friends about the Colt plan.  Only Mr. Grossman has been charged criminally in the case. The SEC, in a related civil suit against Mr. Grossman and the six others, claims the group made the $1.5 million on an initial investment of about $33,938.  Mr. Grossman's attorney, Irving Seidman, has declined to comment on the case.  Pending the arraignment, Mr. Grossman, of Brooklyn, remains free on $1 million bond. The government said the case is unrelated to other recent insider-trading cases such as the one involving Ivan F. Boesky. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0024': 'Electric Utility Analysts Almost Never Discuss Financial Impact of Accidents at Nuclear Plants --- By Bill Paul</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD) UTILITIES (UTI) NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK) </IN> When Wall Street analysts advise investors about electric utility stocks they talk a lot about dividends, return on equity and other financial yardsticks.  What they almost never discuss is the financial impact of a nuclear plant accident.  It\\'s commonly assumed that in the event of another accident like the one at Three Mile Island, a utility would be insured under the federal Price-Anderson Act for any liability to third parties, while private insurance covered the property damage and the cost of buying replacement power.  But as Southern California Edison has urgently started noting, the maximum private insurance currently available to utilities might not come close to covering the property damage from a nuclear accident. After an accident, a utility might face a \"financial crisis,\" said John Bryson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Rosemead, Calif., company.  Mr. Bryson estimates it would cost $2 billion to decontaminate and remove damaged equipment from a plant after an accident like the one at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. That cost would exceed the $1.2 billion in property insurance available for any one accident from the industry\\'s Bermuda-based mutual insurance company.  The $800 million difference probably would come out of investors\\' pockets. State regulators might be reluctant to pass along such costs to ratepayers, said Mr. Bryson, a former president of the California Public Utilities Commission. And the $2 billion wouldn\\'t cover the hefty cost of repairing or tearing down the damaged plant.  Such issues are being pondered by a number of institutional investors that recently have harvested 20% annual returns by purchasing nuclear plants and then leasing them back to utilities. Buyers might lose their investments and face possible lawsuits as well, analysts think, though purchase agreements may assign accident risks to the the utility. One buyer is Emerson Electric, which said it wouldn\\'t have \"any serious financial liability\" in the event of an accident. Other buyers include banks such as Security Pacific, which hadn\\'t any comment.  At Southern California Edison\\'s urging, the industry\\'s mutual insurer is surveying its 65 members on whether property coverage should be raised. Utilities already pay hefty insurance premiums. The survey should be completed in a couple of months, says Quentin Jackson, vice president and general manager of Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. in Hamilton, Bermuda.  Mr. Bryson views another Three Mile Island-type accident as a \"remote\" possibility. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, while emphasizing that there isn\\'t any undue risk to the public, recently began examining whether its regulations really are sufficient to minimize the chance of an accident. According to a recent report by the NRC\\'s operations office, safety-related electrical and mechanical equipment in nuclear plants currently is judged on criteria that \"have in many instances not been thoroughly validated.\"  The U.S. has a total of 105 operable commercial reactors, with 109 utility owners. \"For a utility like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, an accident wouldn\\'t be catastrophic\" because the big San Francisco company has $6 billion in equity, says analyst Daniel F. Scotto of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. But for a utility with $1 billion in equity, \"it would be a terrible catastrophe.\"  Analysts say a number of yardsticks are needed to evaluate plant safety. Certain designs have prompted the NRC and others to raise questions about potential safety problems. These include General Electric\\'s Mark I containment shell and the Babcock &amp; Wilcox-designed reactors. Both manufacturers have denied that their products pose any special risk.  The NRC periodically conducts plant safety inspections. The results are known as SALPs, for Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance.  According to Michael Mariotte, editor of an anti-nuclear newsletter in Washington that analyzes SALP reports, plants whose recent SALPs have been among the worst include Commonwealth Edison\\'s Byron 1 and its LaSalle 1 and 2. Others were Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric\\'s Cook 1 and 2 and Toledo Edison\\'s Davis-Besse plant.  A SALP just released for Niagara Mohawk\\'s Nine Mile Point 1 site also was critical. A spokesman for the Syracuse, N.Y., utility said it expects to quickly regain the site\\'s previously \"excellent\" SALP rating.  In Chicago, Commonwealth Edison disagreed with Mr. Mariotte. It said Byron\\'s latest SALP \"looked very good\" while a newly released SALP for LaSalle 1 and 2 was \"just fine\" and noted \"substantial improvement\" from the prior report.  A spokesman for Toledo Edison, a unit of Centerior Energy, said the newsletter editor\\'s ranking was \"not fair.\" Because Davis-Besse had a near-accident in 1985, he said, $180 million has gone into plant improvements and the company was recently praised by the NRC. American Electric Power, parent of Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric, called its Cook operations \"sound\" though the NRC has had \"procedural\" complaints.  Meanwhile, utility officials have another worry: A nuclear accident anywhere in the world might prompt political pressure that could close U.S. reactors with the same design as the damaged plant.

       " 'WSJ870318-0023': 'Wheeling Steel\\'s George A. Ferris Resigns Two Posts --- By J. Ernest Beazley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN> In another management shake-up at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., George A. Ferris resigned the posts of vice chairman and chief executive officer, and the steelmaker named its biggest stockholder chairman.  The nation\\'s No. 7 steelmaker disclosed the management changes last night during a marathon board meeting in which Lloyd C. Lubensky, president of Ryder System Inc.\\'s American Jet Industries Inc. unit, was named chairman.  A Wheeling-Pittsburgh spokesman declined to comment on the personnel shuffle, which capped more than two months of uncertainty about who was in charge at the steelmaker.  Questions began surfacing in early January when Allan E. Paulson sold his 34.2% stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh to Mr. Lubensky and resigned as chairman, a post he had held since September 1985. Mr. Paulson also is chairman and chief executive of Chrysler Corp.\\'s Gulfstream Aerospace unit.  Though Mr. Lubensky was expected to succeed Mr. Paulson, a friend and business associate, directors delayed naming a successor. Then, last month, the board sidestepped the issue by placing in charge a three-member executive committee composed of Messrs. Lubensky and Ferris and John P. Innes, a director and former Gulfstream executive.  The election of Mr. Lubensky thus represented an about-face and the steelmaker\\'s third top-management change in a little more than two months. Moreover, the 70-year-old Mr. Ferris, a retired Ford Motor Co. vice president whom Mr. Paulson recruited in 1985, hadn\\'t hinted of plans to leave the company.  In a statement yesterday, Mr. Lubensky indicated that more management changes may come shortly. The company is \"analyzing its management structure and personnel with the view to seeking several new outside directors and a new chief executive officer.\" Mr. Lubensky declined to return phone calls seeking further comment.  Mr. Ferris, who didn\\'t attend yesterday\\'s board meeting, said in a brief interview, \"I\\'ve done this just about long enough -- I just decided to retire.\" He said he didn\\'t resign as a result of any disagreement with Mr. Lubensky about company policies or operations.  Nonetheless, the upheaval in Wheeling-Pittsburgh\\'s executive suite comes as the company struggles to emerge from protection under the bankruptcy laws. Moreover, the company is hardly robust financially.  For the 1986 fourth quarter, the steelmaker posted a net loss of $213.8 million after taking hefty restructuring charges. In the year-earlier period, Wheeling-Pittsburgh had a net loss of $94.1 million. ',\n",

The 12-nation group posted a surplus of $5.63 billion, converting the European Currency Unit at its current rate, in contrast to a 1985 deficit of $31.52 billion.  The swing in the European Community's trade balance was caused mainly by the fact that prices for imports -- mainly commodities -- fell more sharply than prices for exports. The EC said imports cost 17% less in 1986 than in 1985, although they rose 7% in volume. Export prices fell 10%.  The trading bloc said its position improved throughout 1986.

       " 'WSJ870318-0021': '$2.5 Billion Plan To Fight Acid Rain</HL> ENVIRONMENT (ENV) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> The White House plans to announce today a new $2.5 billion, five-year plan for dealing with acid rain, meant to appease Canada before President Reagan\\'s trip there next month.  The plan, White House sources said, will require the U.S. government to commit as much as $500 million in each of the next five fiscal years to such programs as \"clean\" coal-burning power plants. The actual spending will depend on the number of projects undertaken in the private sector and on matching funds available from industry.  The potential $500 million annual commitment marks an increase from the administration\\'s budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which provides $287 million for programs related to acid rain.  If the administration makes available the full amount allowed in the new plan, it would follow more closely an agreement reached in Washington last March between Canada and the U.S. In that agreement, President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney endorsed a special envoys\\' report calling for a $5 billion, five-year acid rain control program to be shared by the two countries.  The Reagan administration has been under pressure from Canada to honor its commitment to that report. Mr. Mulroney, who faces political difficulties at home, publicly chided Vice President Bush during a state visit to Ottawa in January.  The White House hopes the new plan will meet with Canadian approval, avoiding political embarrassment when President Reagan meets with Mr. Mulroney in Ottawa April 5 and 6. ',\n",

Levin Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> If you had spent the past year in a monastery, you might not be aware that the world\\'s biggest company and one of its richest men locked horns in a messy corporate donnybrook. And you certainly wouldn\\'t know it from reading the annual report of the company -- General Motors Corp.  GM\\'s colorful 44-page magazine was released yesterday, with nary a hint of H. Ross Perot\\'s barbed criticisms of GM management, GM\\'s subsequent $742.8 million repurchase of the GM shares held by Mr. Perot and several associates, and the flurry of shareholder lawsuits against GM that followed.  Instead, Chairman Roger B. Smith and President F. James McDonald mention in paragraph 43 of their 45-paragraph letter to stockholders that \"Ross Perot resigned as chief executive of Electronic Data Systems Corporation\" on Dec 1. And back on page 38, footnote 15 states that 11,791,790 Class E shares were \"reacquired from certain employees and former stockholders of EDS.\" Guess who!  Why the omission of one of the biggest corporate news stories of the year? \"I don\\'t know if (Mr. Perot\\'s departure) is more substantial than any of the other management changes we\\'ve had in the last year,\" says John W. McNulty, GM\\'s vice president for public relations. Mr. McNulty also notes that GM responded by letter to any shareholder who requested a detailed explanation of the Perot affair. So far, a GM spokesman says, the company has mailed more than 200 such letters.  GM may be getting a head start on an idea it has proposed to the Securities and Exchange Commission to replace the traditional annual report with a \"summary\" annual report. But a spokesman adds that there is no plan to drop the annual report entirely.  Sid Cato, who publishes a monthly newsletter on corporate annual reports, has a different view from GM on its handling of the Perot news. \"It\\'s totally wrong and a disservice to shareholders,\" says the Chicago public-relations man.\"GM has adhered to the letter of the securities law, but not the spirit. It\\'s a classically poor annual report.\"  It\\'s also a leading candidate, Mr. Cato says, for his \"Ten Worst Annual Reports\" list, which is published annually in Chief Executive Magazine. In fact, Mr. Cato says that so far -- with most annual reports yet to be issued -- GM is the only contender in house. ',\n",

In a 1981 complaint, the FTC charged that the companies\\' labeling and advertising misrepresented the amount of down filling in garments. In a consent order filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Denver, the companies agreed they wouldn\\'t engage in such misrepresentation in the future. The order also imposed detailed new labeling and testing requirements for the companies\\' down garments.  The commission approved the settlement 4-1, with Andrew Strenio dissenting.  Sears is based in Chicago, and Kellwood has its headquarters in St. Louis. Consent agreements are for settlement purposes only and don\\'t constitute an admission of a law violation.  Sears said it is confident it acted in \"good faith and in the best interest of its customers\" immediately after learning of possible labeling discrepancies on some down-filled garments in 1978.  The retail and financial services concern said it voluntarily initiated its own down-labeling correction program at considerable company expense, a full month before the FTC began its investigation and more than three years before the FTC filed its lawsuit.  Sears said that as part of the voluntary correction program, it removed $75 million of down-filled merchandise from stores, retested and, where necessary, relabeled goods and nationally offered a full refund for any Sears down product purchased before the correction program.  The company added that after eight years of vigorously defending its actions, it accepted the FTC\\'s offer to settle out of court, to avoid further legal expenses.  Likewise, a spokesman for Kellwood, an apparel concern, said that the case cost the company a \"great deal of money and time\" over the eight years and that it was easier to pay a small amount than to let the litigation continue. He added that the company didn\\'t admit it was liable. ',\n",

Nevertheless, the state Public Utilities Commission refused to reconsider its decision disallowing certain direct costs associated with the $4.5 billion project. The decision follows a ruling by the commission in October to disallow $344.6 million in building costs.  The commission said the methodology it used in disallowing indirect costs would be reviewed in the rehearing, which a commission spokeswoman said could be held in the next two months.  The two utilities had challenged $185.8 million of the October disallowance, saying those costs had resulted from delays in the licensing process. Disallowances force the utilities to absorb more of their costs on the project than they had expected, reducing the amount of profit they can record.  Spokesmen for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Rosemead, Calif.-based Southern California Edison said their companies were disappointed by the commission\\'s latest decision to restrict the rehearing. They said the companies intend to study the ruling and will consider appealing it to the state Supreme Court.  Howard P. Allen, chairman of Southern California Edison, said that while the company was \"heartened\" at the review of the disallowance of indirect costs, \"we feel strongly that we presented a compelling case for reviewing the three licensing issues of seismic review, emergency preparedness and senior reactor operator training.\"  Southern California Edison has a 75% interest and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric holds the remaining 25% stake in the plant, which is located on the Pacific Coast between Los Angeles and San Diego.

The controversy throws a new shadow over New York-based AT&amp;T\\'s effort to become a serious competitor in the European telephone equipment market. Several AT&amp;T rivals, notably Siemens AG of West Germany and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson of Sweden, have put together competing groups in an effort to counter the AT&amp;T-Philips bid.

       " 'WSJ870318-0006': '--- Problem of How to Pay for Decommissioning Remains Unresolved --- By Bill Richards Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK) UTILITIES (UTI) </IN> Commonwealth Edison Co. has so far charged its customers $176.9 million for the cost of someday retiring its nine nuclear reactors.  The Illinois utility carries the decommissioning fund on its books, but with the approval of state regulators, it has already spent the money on other matters -- a practice many states allow. The company, the nation\\'s largest nuclear utility, says it\\'s better for ratepayers to spend the money now and raise funds through other means when it\\'s time to retire their nuclear plants. Other utility officials agree.  Nevertheless, the practice is one reason why the issue of how to pay to retire nuclear plants -- a problem utilities won\\'t face until after the turn of the century, but one that is projected to cost billions -- is already an important nuclear battleground.  Public interest groups and some federal and state regulators say utilities aren\\'t adequately providing for future decommissioning costs. Among other things, they say, the methods many utilities use to account for decommissioning funds are misleading. They also say utilities woefully underestimate how much decommissioning will cost.  With some 66 commercial nuclear reactors due for permanent shutdowns by 2010, the stakes in the struggle over decommissioning are enormous. California\\'s Public Utilities Commission recently ruled that Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. will need to put aside $53.6 million annually for the next 28 years to fund the dismantling of its new Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. Allowing for inflation, that would put the cost of permanently shutting the plant 30 years from now at $3.89 billion. Pacific G&amp;E spent $5.8 billion to build Diablo Canyon.  Even the utilities\\' own experts admit that when it comes to estimating decommissioning costs they are groping in the dark. Joseph Geruch, manager of technical accounting for Hartford, Conn.-based Northeast Utilities, which owns all or part of seven nuclear reactors, calls current estimates on decommissioning costs \"a crapshoot.\" Mr. Geruch points out that no large nuclear plant has ever been dismantled, the U.S. has still not chosen a radioactive waste disposal site, and the effects of inflation are hard to predict. \"Until the actual decommissioning occurs, we won\\'t know the cost,\" he says.  The Diablo Canyon case illustrates just how broad the knowledge gap is. To cover unknowns such as labor strikes, technological problems, regulatory changes and the like, Pacific G&amp;E offered to set up a contingency fund equal to 25% of the plant\\'s estimated dismantling cost. Critics, however, insisted on a 100% contingency set-aside. Eventually, California regulators compromised at 50%, bringing the total cost of dismantling the plant to $3.89 billion. But Bruce DeBerry, a commission staff member, calls the true cost of dismantling such plants \"a big unknown.\"  So far, only one commercial reactor, Duquesne Light Co.\\'s 72,000-kilowatt Shippingport Atomic Power Station at Shippingport, Pa., has actually begun decommissioning. The estimated cost of dismantling the plant is nearly $100 million. But Shippingport is relatively small potatoes compared with some of the newer nuclear giants, which generate more than one million kilowatts, and experts say it is impossible to use the plant for a guideline for dismantling the larger reactors.  The uncertainty over decommissioning costs also worries the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees operation of the nation\\'s nuclear plants. The NRC plans to issue rules on the subject later this year, requiring nuclear utilities to come up with their own decommissioning estimates or use the commission\\'s generic plan, which puts the cost of decommissioning and dismantling a nuclear plant at $100 million in current dollars for all size plants.  But there are indications the NRC\\'s estimate could be low. The commission\\'s projection is based on 1984 figures supplied by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory of Richland, Wash. Battelle officials say their $100 million estimate covers only the cost of removing the most radioactive elements within a plant\\'s nuclear reactor. Razing an entire nuclear plant would cost much more.  Duane Chapman, a Cornell University economist who testified before the California commission on the Diablo Canyon plant, says dismantling spent nuclear reactors will be so costly that most utilities will eventually elect to entomb reactors where they stand rather than pay to have them cut up and hauled off to a burial site.  Up to now, federal regulators have left it to the states to decide how utilities should fund nuclear shutdown programs. But the resulting mishmash of plans has raised concern that no matter what the cost, some utilities won\\'t have adequate funds available when decommissioning time arrives.  In a study, Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., a Boston-based nuclear engineering firm, concluded that dismantling spent nuclear plants ultimately would be cheaper even though the initial costs would be much higher than entombing the plants and maintaining and guarding them for the indefinite future. The engineering firm estimated annual costs for security alone at $108,000 to $192,000 a year.  Eleven states now require nuclear utilities to segregate decommissioning money in an external fund with an outside manager. The rest, however, allow utilities to collect money from customers for decommissioning but keep the money in in-house funds which can then be mingled with general utility revenues. As a result, nuclear utilities such as Commonwealth Edison carry their decommissioning funds on their books, but spend the actual cash.  Utility officials say this makes economic sense. Northeast Utilities\\' Mr. Geruch, who heads the decommissioning subcommittee for the Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry trade group, argues that using decommissioning funds for capital investment gives ratepayers a better return on their money, compared with simply putting the cash aside to gather interest for 30 years. When a plant is ready for decommissioning, Mr. Geruch says, utilities can use other assets to raise cash.  But critics say in-house funds are risky and misleading. \"The main problem is that a utility may simply spend the money and if they\\'ve been bad managers there\\'s nothing left when it comes time to decommission,\" says Kenneth Bossong, an official of Critical Mass, a Washington-based public interest organization.  Even Mr. Geruch admits the regulatory tide seems to be running toward requiring external funding for utilities\\' decommissioning funds. \"Politically, external funding is wiser,\" he says. Federal and state regulators \"want to know what condition we\\'ll be in 40 years down the road.\"  Among the most ardent proponents of external decommissioning funds are bankers and other professional cash managers. The pool of such funds represents a potential bonanza for cash managers, offering sizable management fees for relatively little risk or effort. \"Some of these funds may start out with just $100 million or so, but after 30 or 40 years they\\'re going to be huge,\" says Robert Lindner, vice president of Citicorp Investment Management Inc.  Mr. Lindner\\'s Chicago-based Citicorp unit was one of eight cash managers that recently vied for Wisconsin Electric Co.\\'s $100 million fund for decommissioning the utility\\'s two-unit Point Beach nuclear plant. By 2007, when the operating license on the plant\\'s first nuclear reactor is scheduled to expire, the utility estimates the fund should be worth nearly $640 million. With that kind of incentive, Mr. Lindner says, \"almost any investment manager handling fixed-income funds would be interested.\" ',\n",

Each school day, the high-school student\\'s mother gets up at 4:30 a.m. to start heating his bath water on the stove. At 5, Juan Carlos rises, bathes and catches the bus for the 1 1/2-hour ride from their village into town. On recent days when he has needed money for a textbook, the family has gone without meat.  \"I serve zucchini sandwiches, spinach sandwiches,\" says his mother, a cleaning lady raising five children alone.  For years, any cleaning lady\\'s son growing up in one of the scruffy cinderblock houses that rim Mexico City has had the same access to the national university as a president\\'s son does. Undergraduate tuition runs about 20 cents a year. Entrance requirements are nil.  Not long ago, university and government officials thought that a \"university of the masses\" could educate entire generations of Juan Carloses, who would then take government jobs -- once reserved for the elite -- and develop the nation.  The strategy hasn\\'t worked. Today, more than 300,000 students choke the sprawling National Autonomous Metropolitan University, called UNAM, in Mexico City. Students sit on the floors, craning to hear. They take their reading lists over to UNAM\\'s famous mosaic-covered library and can\\'t find many books. They wait all day for moonlighting professors. Hopes that graduates would hasten development have been crushed under a mountain of bureaucrats who add more to government costs than to social welfare.  Mexico isn\\'t alone. France opened its state university doors after \"les evenements\" of 1968. Nigeria used its oil wealth in the 1970s to build new campuses and give free cafeteria food to a flood of students. In Argentina, the populist Peron government invited the sons of the working class to become scholars. Socialists in Chile experimented with a \"university for all\" before the 1973 coup.  \"It seems strange to most people in the United States, but public universities in most parts of the world don\\'t charge tuition,\" says Daniel C. Levy, a professor of educational policy and Latin American studies at the State University of New York in Albany.  But in many countries, the results look a lot like Mexico\\'s: too many students, too many bureaucrats, and too many young people such as Juan Carlos Hernandez with overly optimistic expectations.  The street in front of Ladislao Alviso\\'s house tells a story of blighted hopes. It is paved with broken cars and auto parts, and the tattoo of a pneumatic wrench rips the air. The 29-year-old Mr. Alviso is a government-educated agricultural engineer, but he and his brother run a curbside auto-repair business.  \"My problems started when I finished school,\" Mr. Alviso says. He spent five years getting his degree, dreaming all the while of someday managing a country gentleman\\'s ranch. Only after graduation did he discover that Mexican country gentlemen like to hire cheap, uneducated peons. There were no private-sector jobs.  But that was in 1978. The government had found vast offshore oil deposits the year before and had plenty of money to give people such as Mr. Alviso government jobs. Hired by the agricultural ministry, Mr. Alviso was packed off to a tiny farming village to carry out a census. As the months went by, however, a painful truth began to dawn on him: He could collect census data forever, but no one back at the ministry would ever use his findings.  \"On every farm,\" he says, \"the people would ask, \\'Why do you need all this information?\\'\" He would tell the farmers that if the government knew their needs, it could lend them money. The farmers smirked. He couldn\\'t blame them.  \"I was there for a whole year, and in all that time, I never saw a single result of anything I had done,\" he says.  The schools and the state scooped up thousands of Mr. Alvisos in the 1970s in answer to the student protests of the 1960s. The economy had been growing in the 1960s, and the urban public had the means to step back and think about the way the country was run. Many didn\\'t like what they saw: a single party, a grotesque maldistribution of wealth, and an inability for anyone without the right political ties to say anything and be heard.  Tens of thousands of protesters, many of them students, turned out in Mexico City streets in 1968. The demonstrations grew bigger and bigger. Eventually, government troops opened fire on one. Some 200 to 300 are believed to have been killed.  The marching stopped, but the anti-government sentiment didn\\'t fade. In the decade that followed, the government embarked on a \"democratic opening\" to win back public trust. It lowered the voting age. It let opposition parties operate above ground. It opened up registries at UNAM and branch campuses.  Jose Leal was a working-class youth caught up in the democratic opening. Until the early 1970s, he never would have dreamed of going to a university or getting a government job. His father was a butcher who had worked out his life in an open-air market. But when UNAM beckoned, Mr. Leal jumped. He spent five years studying mechanical engineering.  Almost all his professors were government employees teaching on the side, he says. Almost all his friends planned to work in the government when they graduated. Mr. Leal never even considered the private sector.  \"My interest wasn\\'t so much the work itself,\" he admits. \"In those days, going into the government was like buying a life-insurance policy.\"  The government was growing furiously. Even in the early 1970s, before the new oil deposits were found, inflation-adjusted government spending grew more than 14% a year, nearly triple the growth rate of the economy. State-run enterprises sprang up by the hundreds. The government built a huge steel mill. It carved glittery resorts out of coastal wilderness. It hired bureaucrats to promote production of edible cactus and palm-frond hats. It built a high-rise ministry of fishing in Mexico City.  \"Most African countries have worked along this same track,\" says Tyler Biggs, a development economist at the Harvard Institute for International Development. \"The governments set up not only civil-service jobs but also public corporations in agriculture and industry. They were very inefficient. All of it became a drain on public funds.\"  Mr. Leal finished his engineering degree and got his government job. He rose through Mexico\\'s planning and budget ministry, and by 1980 he was evaluating a program to make Mexico self-sufficient in grain. He reviewed farm achievements in the countryside, then briefed state governors. Once the governors could recite his statistics, they would guide the president on fact-finding tours.  The job didn\\'t have much to do with mechanical engineering. On a day-to-day level, it didn\\'t even have much to do with producing more grain. But to Mr. Leal, it meant that at least one poor butcher\\'s son had arrived.  \"I was part of a public-sector jet set,\" he says. \"I got to see the president up close. Governors would come pick me up in their planes. I lived power.\"  Then, in 1982, the economy crashed. The food program vanished in a wave of budget cuts. But Mr. Leal wasn\\'t cut -- he was just moved. He wound up in a government personnel office, taking pictures for ID badges. \"From talking to the president to telling middle-level functionaries, \\'Say cheese!\\'\" he says. \"It was like something out of Kafka.\"  So much for Mr. Leal\\'s lofty visions of mass education and state-led development. From his new vantage point, he says, he saw a lot of overqualified, ill-deployed professionals like himself. \"We were creating an enormous inefficiency,\" he says. Today, he is back at the national university, this time studying for a master\\'s degree in civil engineering. He hasn\\'t any intention of working in government again.  \"That\\'s a luxury we allow ourselves in underdeveloped countries,\" he says.  Some social critics argue that the government buildup in the 1970s wasn\\'t meant so much to foment democracy and development as to hide the failure to provide enough real jobs. They see UNAM as a place to put the young on a shelf -- not to give them equal opportunity. There aren\\'t any cafeterias or student unions at UNAM; all were closed after 1968 to keep students from sitting together and hatching plots.  \"Students are brought here to keep them out of the job market,\" says Joel Ortega, an economics professor. \"Their professional development is almost zero. It\\'s a big hoax, public education in Mexico.\"  As academic standards have fallen, many children of the rich have fled to private universities and foreign schools. And those that remain haven\\'t really been threatened. Rich and poor students lead very different lives at UNAM. The rich drive to class in the morning, make promising contacts at cafes in the afternoon and study at night. The poor work all day, come to evening classes on the bus and never have enough time to study.  \"It\\'s the thing I hate most about this place,\" says Manuel Vazquez, a 26-year-old Spanish-literature student.  Neither of Mr. Vazquez\\'s parents finished grade school. The only \"books\" in his house while he was growing were Spanish editions of Reader\\'s Digest. Now, at UNAM, he finds himself jammed into classrooms with 70 other students. The only way to be noticed, he says, is to sip coffee in the afternoon at a nearby literary cafe. He can\\'t, because he works all day.  Mr. Vazquez sits on the front step of the philosophy and letters college, watching the morning students leave. He smokes Marlboros and grinds out the butts with his work boots.  \"They\\'re all trying to be the apostles of those damned poets,\" he complains. \"They come here to play, to pose, to show off their culture. They\\'re people who feel different from the rest of society.\"  The Mexican government is now trying to scale back some of the bloat of the 1970s. It isn\\'t just that there isn\\'t enough money anymore. There is also growing sentiment that in a poor country, the public shouldn\\'t have to subsidize so many students and bureaucrats. The government has sold some state enterprises and has laid off bureaucrats. University officials are trying to raise academic standards.  But they are working against nearly 20 years of social-justice rhetoric, which has built up powerful expectations in the young. Last fall, officials tried to raise tuition, restrict enrollment and limit the number of times a student could flunk. Over the winter, students struck UNAM and closed it. The officials backed off and said students could help fix the tuition and academic standards.  Educational-policy specialists aren\\'t surprised.  \"It sounds very close to what I remember in Nigeria,\" says Mr. Biggs, the Harvard economist, who taught at public universities in Nigeria and Kenya. Nigeria ran into financial problems in the early 1980s and tried to start charging for food in its student cafeterias. \"The students rioted and tried to kill people,\" he says.  The French and Spanish governments recently tried to raise academic standards and also ran into violent opposition.

The health care services company said the transaction, which is part of its capital restructuring program, will result in a pre-tax gain of about $11.8 million, which will be amortized over the initial lease term. Proceeds will be used to repay the $50 million mortgage on the facilities previously provided by Healthvest when Healthcare purchased the hospital last year.  Healthcare also said it plans to restructure and reduce its $200 million floating rate credit arrangement with a syndicate of seven banks led by New York-based Citicorp's Citibank unit. If completed, Healthcare said it expects to lower the cost of its credit arrangement and to change the terms to reflect its need for operating and development capital rather than real estate project financing.  Healthcare said the restructuring may result in an acceleration of the amortization of financing costs in the form of a nonrecurring charge of between $1.6 million and $2 million, possibly in the current quarter.  Elliott H. Weir Jr., Healthcare executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company is seeking a new credit arrangement with current and prospective lenders. He said the company expects to complete the arrangement in the near future.  Separately, Healthcare said it intends to buy back as much as $5 million of its Class A common stock from time to time on the open market. Healthcare currently has 4,524,820 Class A shares outstanding. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Healthcare closed at $9 a share, down 12.5 cents.  Healthcare said a portion of the shares it buys back will be for its employee stock purchase and stock option programs. Other shares will be retired in an effort to increase the company's per-share earnings. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870318-0002': '</HL> President Reagan will hold his first news conference in four months tomorrow at 8 p.m. EST, the White House announced.  At a Rose Garden ceremony yesterday, the president told reporters he was \"looking forward to it.\" He is expected to face questions on arms control, trade, and the turmoil surrounding his administration since the Iran-Contra affair erupted last November.  The White House has explained the four-month hiatus in news conferences by saying that the president wanted to wait for the Tower Commission\\'s report on his policy toward Iran and Nicaragua. The report was issued late last month.  Last week, the president and his aides agreed they wanted a news conference. But aides delayed until they felt they had adequate time to brief the president, whose performance at the last news conference Nov. 19 required the White House to issue a correction. Top aides agree that the president, whose detached management style was criticized by the Tower panel, must appear fully in control.  Asked about the possibility that the president would again appear unprepared, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater yesterday said, \"It\\'s a risk that has to be assumed. . . .I think he\\'s prepared.

       " 'WSJ870318-0124': '--- By David Hale</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN> One of the most distinguishing features of the world economy during the mid-1980s has been a boom in financial markets coincident with sluggish growth in real business activity and depression in many commodity-producing industries.  This divergence is not an accident. With fiscal policy in most industrial countries moving in a restrictive direction and capital flows to developing countries having slowed to a trickle, rising financial-asset prices are one of the few mechanisms left to central bankers for transforming surplus liquidity and falling interest rates into potential economic growth.  The problem with this adjustment process is that the world financial system is not a \"level playing field.\" There is a tremendous asymmetry in the responsiveness of different national economies to falling interest rates.  The Anglo-Saxon nations, such as the U.S. and Britain, have highly competitive financial systems that expand credit rapidly when monetary policy is eased. The Japanese financial system, by contrast, is very regulated and does not easily recycle surplus liquidity from savers to spenders. As a result, the Japanese corporate sector is currently using its excess liquidity to engage in aggressive stock market speculation. This has pushed share-price multiples to such high levels that the recently privatized Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. now boasts a price-earnings ratio of 250 and a capitalization in excess of the entire West German stock market. In Germany, falling interest rates are a less potent stimulant to growth than in the past because the population is shrinking at the rate of 3,000 a week and there is an increasing stock of vacant housing.  In the 1970s, this asymmetry was less of a barrier to stimulating demand because expansionary monetary policy in the industrial countries helped boost exports, not just domestic consumption, by encouraging a large increase in bank lending to developing countries. This, in turn, generated powerful effects on global consumption of capital goods, which itself reinforced economic growth in developing nations by increasing demand in the industrial countries for raw materials to produce the goods. Since 1982, though, there has been a sharp decline in the world-wide level of interest rates without any major revival of capital flows to developing countries. Instead, they have exported nearly $90 billion to the industrial countries through interest payments on existing loans.  The inability of most developing countries to tap the surplus liquidity of the industrial countries poses a potential dilemma for central banks. It could require the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to tolerate further rapid growth in domestic borrowing and stock market speculation simply to sustain modest growth in the world economy. Under such circumstances, financial-asset inflation could become so excessive that the central banks might ultimately feel compelled to tighten again even if economic growth remains slow.  Ironically, the most effective way to reduce the danger of financial excesses occurring in New York and Tokyo would not be to raise interest rates and depress equity markets. Rather, it would be to correct the uneven distribution of liquidity in the world financial system by expanding the capitalization of stock markets in developing countries in order to help them become capital importers again.  Bond and stock markets have not been important conduits for international capital transfers in recent decades, but during the half century before 1914 they were the primary mechanism for recycling excess savings from the industrial countries to newly developing regions. During this period, Britain and France embarked upon a global securitized lending and equity investment boom so large that by 1913 both countries\\' external assets were equal to between 150% and 200% of their gross national product. (This compares with a peak of only 8% for the U.S. five years ago and less than 15% for Japan today.)  British investors turned to foreign securities during the late 19th century because of the low yield then available on domestic debt. The large decline in interest rates in industrialized countries since 1984, coupled with today\\'s excess capacity in global investment banking, suggests that now could be an opportune time to revive the role of stock markets as intermediaries for recycling more of the world\\'s surplus savings to the developing countries.  During the past 12 months, Wall Street has successfully launched several new mutual funds targeted on Australian bonds as well as the equity markets of Taiwan, South Korea, India and other developing countries. These funds have raised only a few hundred million dollars compared with the $25 billion to $35 billion banks lent annually to the Third World during the late 1970s, but the premiums being paid by investors for them in the secondary market suggest that demand for developing-country equity products today exceeds supply.  Governments in developing countries must now pursue policies to accelerate the growth of foreign investment in their equity markets by (a) encouraging more private companies to go public through improved tax treatment of dividends and capital gains; (b) privatizing nationalized industries; (c) creating effective stock market regulatory agencies as well as more reliable public accounting standards; and (d) relaxing restrictions on foreign investment in domestic companies.  At present, the 15 largest stock markets in the developing countries have an aggregate capitalization of just under $145 billion, which is equal to about 14% of their GNP. If they could expand this percentage to 25% over the next six years against a background of only 6% growth in their nominal dollar GNP, the total value of their market capitalizations would exceed $400 billion by 1993.  If this sounds ambitious, consider that the stock market capitalization of the world\\'s 14 largest industrial countries has grown from $2.2 trillion in 1980 to almost $6 trillion today. Since developing countries have higher potential growth rates than mature industrial economies, the value of their stock market capitalizations should increase even more rapidly if they pursue policies designed to encourage equity ownership.  Although the development of equity markets is a theoretically attractive way to increase capital flows, some developing countries resist using them as vehicles for attracting foreign savings. Nationalized industries are often a source of patronage and hence political power. Also, many governments associate foreign ownership with loss of control over the economy.  Although fear of foreign control is a natural legacy of the colonial era, governments could liberalize investment guidelines without losing control of their economies. Instead of permitting completely open access to their stock markets, developing countries could permit gradual liberalization through the creation of mutual funds specially targeted at foreign investors while introducing official ceilings on foreign ownership of strategic industries. Japan permitted the creation of such mutual funds in the 1960s before opening its market to direct foreign purchases of local shares. A similar process is under way in Korea and Taiwan. Singapore, meanwhile, permits foreign investors to purchase any of its equities, but has a 20% foreign ownership ceiling on several important companies.  If we apply an across-the-board 20% ownership restriction on the $400 billion of equity capitalization that could be available in the early 1990s under policies designed to achieve a 25% stock market/GNP ratio, the equity markets of developing countries would be able to absorb up to $80 billion of foreign investment without jeopardizing official ceilings.  In addition to the creation of more mutual funds, there would probably also be a good market for hybrid instruments, such as convertible debt or bonds with equity warrants. Because of restrictions on foreign purchases of Korean stock, there has been strong demand for Korean Eurobonds, which can be converted into equity later. Other obvious candidates for such hybrid instruments would include countries sensitive to the question of foreign ownership, such as Brazil, India and Mexico. Developing-country mutual funds also could tap into the growing secondary market for Third World bank loans in order to obtain foreign exchange at a discount, as is now happening with multinational companies operating in Mexico, Chile and the Philippines.  It is possible that investors diversifying into developing-country financial markets will repeat the mistakes of U.S. bankers in the 1970s. During America\\'s emergence as a major capital exporter in the 1920s, U.S. investors bought more than $6 billion in bonds from issuers in Latin America and Central Europe; almost 40% were defaulted on in the Depression. In fact, the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted partly because of public outrage at First National City Co. of New York for securitizing its bad Peruvian loans and selling them to unsophisticated retail investors.  But except for the 1920s, history suggests that bond and stock investors have done a better of job of screening risks than commercial banks. In the early 1970s, the Philippines had one of the largest stock markets in Asia, but it shrank steadily during the final years of the Marcos regime because of economic mismanagement and theft of company assets by Marcos cronies. If bankers had monitored the Manila stock market more carefully, they might have made fewer bad loans to the Philippines.  Last year, a slump in foreign demand for Australian bonds forced the Hawke government to introduce policies more favorable for attracting investment and reducing the country\\'s external deficit. Had commercial banks been financing the country\\'s payments imbalance, it might have remained on a policy course akin to Latin America\\'s in the late 1970s.  The next time the Brazilian finance minister, Dilson Funaro, travels north in search of financial assistance, he should not bother to stop in Washington. Instead, Mr. Funaro should fly directly to Tokyo and unveil the prospectus for a new trillion yen Nippon-Brazil Fund. Not only would such a fund give a boost to his country\\'s beleaguered capital account, it also would provide an alternative outlet for Japan\\'s excess savings and help to prevent Tokyo\\'s liquidity-crazed stockbrokers from pushing the price-earnings multiple of NT&amp;T to such lofty levels that the company\\'s capitalization would exceed all of Latin America\\'s $350 billion of foreign debt.  --- Mr. Hale is chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.  ---  Equity Markets 1986 Market Size (In billions        As Percent of U.S. dollars)            Of GDP U.S.              $2.2 (trillion)            52.3% Asia South Korea             14.0                 16.5 Taiwan                  13.2                 22.3 Philippines              2.0                  6.2 Thailand                 2.9                  7.5 Malaysia and Singapore           32.6                 68.6 Indonesia                0.5                  0.6 India                   20.0                 12.2 Latin America Brazil                  44.0                 21.5 Mexico                   6.0                  3.9 Argentina                1.6                  2.4 Chile                    2.7                 13.5 Africa and Midest Nigeria                  2.5                  3.0 Zimbabwe                 0.4                  7.4 Jordan                   2.6                 57.8 ',\n",

Zentralsparkasse is the latest recipient to return some of the $38 million paid last year during and after the British brewer\\'s $3.8 billion takeover of Distillers Co. The payments are at the center of a government investigation of possibly illegal share manipulation in the acquisition.

The last two bowed out in a blaze of capital flight, bank runs and rumors of coups.  President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado\\'s departure isn\\'t until December 1988, but that matters little. This fall, he will name the man who will succeed him, and already talk of the succession fills the newspapers and gossip mills. Once Mr. de la Madrid makes his decision, he will enter the high-pressure, lame-duck stage that undid his predecessors.  \"The lame-duck period is the dangerous period,\" says M. Delal Baer, a research associate at the Mexico Project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"In general, people perceive the system to be vulnerable then.\"  Just because the two most recent presidents left in turmoil doesn\\'t mean it will happen again. But the mistakes they made at the end of their \"sexenios,\" or six-year terms, overshadow in Mexican minds the more graceful exits of some of their predecessors.  \"Once you\\'ve got two sexenios under your belt, it begins to create a pattern of expectations,\" says Ms. Baer. \"There\\'s a tremendous amount of anxiety out there, and that anxiety tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"  In Mexico, ordinary citizens have no influence over the president\\'s choice of a candidate to replace him: They simply vote once the choice is made. Nor can any contender for the nomination come out and admit he is running and say what he stands for; he won\\'t be picked. \"He who moves won\\'t show up in the photo,\" a popular saying goes.  So the public makes up for what it lacks in facts and participation by endless speculating about who the \"presidenciables\" are and what policies they might implement. Nearly every major news event seems to be linked in the public imagination with the race. Are students striking the national university? Somebody must be trying to make the law-and-order interior minister look bad. Has the government steel company signed a deal with Argentina? The dapper minister of state enterprises must be trying to get headlines.  Pessimists say that if people are gossipy now, just wait until after Mr. de la Madrid names the next president. They worry the government will try to win the public over by boosting government spending, or taking some other populist tack.  \"People say, \\'Fifth year: That means absolute disaster and fiscal irresponsibility,\\'\" says a Mexican monetary official. \"And it\\'s true, if you look at the last two sexenios.\"  Two sexenios ago, President Luis Echeverria spent his first year in office, 1970, playing the part of the fiscal conservative. But after that, he pumped up government spending. Inflation surged. Investors started shipping their money out of the country.  In Mr. Echeverria\\'s lame-duck year, panic took over: Foreign-exchange reserves melted away, the peso collapsed, bank runs threatened almost daily. Mr. Echeverria responded by playing the populist: He hiked wages and expropriated vast tracts of farmland for distribution among peasants. The panic itself lasted only about three months, but private-sector confidence has been damaged to this day.  Mr. Echeverria named Jose Lopez Portillo to succeed him. Mr. Lopez Portillo, likewise, cooled the economy in his first year, then stepped up deficit spending. Inflation bounced back. Panic struck again as the sexenio reached a close: Hard-currency reserves bled away, the peso collapsed, and Mexico had to ask for a debt moratorium. In another burst of populism, Mr. Lopez Portillo expropriated the nation\\'s banks. That convinced some businessmen that no investment in Mexico is safe.  At the height of the panic, rumors abounded that a military coup was in the making; one false report making the rounds even had it that Mr. Lopez Portillo had been shot in the leg.  Political analysts say the problem is unbridled executive power. The Mexican government has a congress and a judicial branch, true, but neither acts as a check on a lame-duck president who wants to make his mark on history.  \"Any president can do whatever he wants, no matter what the United States wants, and no matter what the Mexican people think about an issue,\" says Ernesto Sanchez Aguilar, a businessman and a leader of the small opposition Social Democratic Party. \"I think it is the key problem in the Mexican political system.\"  And Mr. de la Madrid? He began his term with budgetary restraint, then later eased off the brakes. Inflation rebounded. Mr. de la Madrid was starting to look a lot like his predecessors, but then oil prices collapsed last year. Suddenly, economic conservatism came back into vogue.  Now even some of Mr. de la Madrid\\'s detractors are praising his behavior in 1986. It convinced them, at least for the moment, that the president is incapable of populist outbursts.  \"Although this president has been called incompetent -- a comment which I don\\'t think is fair -- he hasn\\'t succumbed to demagoguery,\" says Robert Pastor, director of the Latin America and Caribbean Program at Emory University in Atlanta. \"He has worked responsibly under more serious crises than he will have in 1987 and 1988.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0142': 'On Film: Women Who \\'Rent\\' Their Bodies Sell Tickets --- By Julie Salamon</HL> Film maker Lizzie Borden has figured out how to draw crowds of Yuppies to a dialectical feminist movie. Show lots of nudity -- most of it female. Pick a tantalizing subject -- prostitution. Film lots of sex.  In other words, make a soft-core porn movie but bathe it in irony instead of soft lights. Call it \"Working Girls,\" and get the backing of COYOTE (\"Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics\"), the San Francisco-based trade group for prostitutes. Announce, as Ms. Borden has, that \"prostitution may be a valid choice given the options.\"  Expanding on this notion, Ms. Borden has asked: \"What is so wrong with renting your body for two shifts a week, when the alternative is a 40-hour-a-week job that makes you so burned out all you can do is come home and watch TV at the end of the day?\"  That may not make moral sense, but it is making money. Ms. Borden\\'s movie has already become a minor hit in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. Critics have labeled it \"fresh\" and \"funny,\" and people who don\\'t look like habitues of Times Square porn houses have been lining up to see it.  The picture does have some very funny moments, but it isn\\'t altogether fresh and it isn\\'t altogether honest. In the end, Ms. Borden, as director, may be another kind of madam: She exploits her \"working girls,\" her actresses, by convincing them that they are engaged in some higher moral purpose. Though she may argue that prostitution is just another line of work, her heroine stops tricking in the end not because she is bored with her job but because it disgusts her. And she steals a bit of business from \"Klute\" when she has a prostitute take a mid-coital peek at her watch.  Ms. Borden, formerly an artist and art critic, has one previous film to her credit. \"Born in Flames\" was a ragged and didactic, but interesting, futuristic vision of a world run by women warriors. While making that film she met some of COYOTE\\'s members and began visiting \"nice\" whorehouses, middle-class brothels where both the prostitutes and their surroundings were discreet and attractive.  She liked what she saw so well that she decided to have one of her own. She re-created one of these businesslike bordellos in her own apartment, in New York\\'s Chinatown, and hired actresses to play the prostitutes and both actors and non-actors to play their customers.  Ms. Borden\\'s heroine is Molly (Louise Smith), a Yale graduate and bisexual who lives with her lover, a black woman, and works at a brothel. Ms. Borden has staged the movie as a documentary-style examination of Molly\\'s working day.  Ms. Borden says the doctor\\'s-office atmosphere she\\'s created accurately represents middle-class brothels she\\'s visited. She certainly does make it all seem clinically accurate, with close-up shots of Molly inserting her diaphragm, of closets full of towels and mouthwash, of used condoms efficiently junked, of prostitutes discussing their clients with the detached interest -- and cynicism -- of doctors and nurses.  The prostitutes dress simply and neatly and greet their customers with cheery receptionist\\'s small talk. Their madame, played adroitly by Ellen McElduff, wears feminine business suits and rules her employees with an iron fist wrapped in lace. The customers -- an assortment of wimps, creeps and mild fetishists -- pass briefly in front of the camera, but Ms. Borden focuses on the boredom and camaraderie among the women. She films the sex with a deliberately unerotic eye.  This befits Ms. Borden\\'s self-proclaimed role as a \"cinematic anthropologist\" out to show the superiority of prostitution over other kinds of routine work for women. In an interview, she repeated her view that \"there are other employment situations where women can feel much more demeaned than they do in prostitution.\" This may sound like addled Marxism, but it actually has more to do with the New York real-estate market than with dialectical materialism. \"There are women,\" she said, \"college grads, who are tired of living with roommates or living in New Jersey. They want to live in Manhattan. So they rent their bodies out once a week to pay the rent.\"  Yet after seeing this movie meant to show the benefits of the prostitute\\'s life I couldn\\'t help but wonder: Is Hoboken really so bad?

       " 'WSJ870317-0141': '</HL> Western analysts have begun to question the image the Kremlin is projecting of Mikhail Gorbachev as a besieged leader threatened by domestic opposition to his drive for economic and social change.  Such a picture of Mr. Gorbachev has increasingly developed over the past several months. It comes from comments in the official Soviet press and by his spokesmen on Soviet and Western television, and in well-publicized speeches by the Soviet leader himself. This impression has focused Western and Soviet attention on whether the 55-year-old Communist Party chief, now starting his third year in power, will survive politically to carry through his modernization drive or fall victim to the growing resistance the Kremlin says he\\'s facing on many fronts, including a self-interested bureaucracy, a passive public, corrupt party officials and opponents in the ruling Politburo itself.  But Western analysts interviewed in the U.S. and Moscow have begun to doubt this portrayal of tentativeness in Mr. Gorbachev\\'s political position. While Mr. Gorbachev\\'s program hasn\\'t sparked anything like spontaneous support, these experts say the Kremlin may be deliberately promoting a \"dramatized\" picture of a radical liberalizer under siege to manipulate both Soviet and Western public opinion about the Soviet leader.  \"The Kremlin is trying to convince us that there\\'s some sort of morality play going on, with Gorbachev as the force of light fighting against almost everyone else as the force of darkness,\" says Prof. Albert Weeks, a Soviet expert at New York University. \"It\\'s a tale that completely distracts from the reality of the situation.\"  Says Jerry Hough, a Kremlinologist from Duke University, \"The impression that opposition has weakened Gorbachev and could make him lose his grip on power is a myth. It\\'s an illusion that his own supporters are promoting.\"  The sources speculate that the aim of such a propaganda campaign could be to engender sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev while diverting attention from two important realities: that the Soviet leader in fact is amassing virtually dictatorial power, and that the officially admitted snail-like pace in implementing his reforms stems not from selfish resistance but from the inherent difficulty of changing a system that is profoundly resistant to change.  Suspicion arose among some Soviet-watchers last summer when claims that the opposition was hampering progress began being heard from a broad array of official sources. The Kremlin\\'s frequent departures from the official line, that conflict from vested interests could only occur in capitalist societies and that Soviet leaders enjoyed unanimous support, appeared to be more than a mere manifestation of Mr. Gorbachev\\'s campaign for openness.  The Soviet leader\\'s putative problems were echoed at Soviet briefings for the foreign press at the October superpower summit in Iceland and in numerous press articles since. Two recent events seemed aimed at highlighting the seriousness of Mr. Gorbachev\\'s problems, which one prominent Soviet spokesman appearing recently on American television described as a \"counterrevolution\" to the Soviet leader\\'s \"revolution.\"  A well-informed Soviet playwright, Mikhail Shatrov, disclosed in both the Soviet and Western press that Politburo opposition to Mr. Gorbachev was so strong he was nearly defeated in the March 1985 contest for the Kremlin\\'s top job by the now-disgraced, old-guard former Moscow city party boss Viktor Grishin.  And in a Pravda article by a top party ideologist, Georgy Smirnov, the 1964 ouster of Nikita Khrushchev, a would-be reformer defeated by a conservative opposition, was publicly lamented, if in veiled terms, for the first time. This ostensibly signaled greater Kremlin concern about Mr. Gorbachev\\'s political future.  In a recent visit to Moscow, Mr. Hough of Duke University noted that the Soviet leader, belying any weakness, has removed from the Politburo all but one opponent. The single holdout, Ukrainian party boss Vladimir Shcherbitsky, is expected to retire next year. Further, Mr. Gorbachev is positioning his chief domestic and foreign policy adviser, candidate Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, as the party\\'s No. 2 man.  \"Power in the ruling Politburo stems from political ability,\" says Mr. Hough. \"And Gorbachev is a great politician. His position today is virtually impregnable. He\\'s as strong as Stalin was in 1927.\"  Western experts say the Kremlin is gambling that as the pitch of the official \"frankness\" about the opposition rises, the more Mr. Gorbachev\\'s supporters, liberals both in the West and within the Soviet Union\\'s middle classes, may be diverted from being alienated by his rapidily growing personal power.  One senior Western diplomat comments that \"his image as an underdog democratizer will win him far more votes among the people he wants to influence here and in the West than if he were perceived as a powerful dictator.  \"Meantime, the opposition Gorbachev and others have been railing against so loudly has made a good scapegoat on which to blame the difficulty of changing this inherently inertial system.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0139': 'A Latin American Hero --- By Carlos Rangel</HL> Robert D. Crassweller\\'s \"Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina\" (Norton, 432 pages, $22.95) is that rare thing: a sympathetic Anglo-Saxon account of a historical figure decidedly unpopular not only in the Anglo-Saxon world, but also with democratic-minded people everywhere, including in Latin America. What makes Mr. Crassweller\\'s book odder still, is that he scrupulously records all the obnoxious deeds of his hero without allowing the dismal inventory to detract from his basic admiration for the man or for the aspects of Argentine culture that produced him.  In fact, Mr. Crassweller\\'s apology for Juan Peron and his wife, Evita, is entirely based on the thesis that there is something that deserves to be called \"Argentine civilization,\" admirable or at least respectable on its own terms, to which the Peron couple were mystically attuned, never mind the consequences.  Mr. Crassweller\\'s book is an extremely well-researched and informative volume. My basic objection is that what Latin America least needs is more apologists for its cultural impediments to political, economic and social progress. We produce those in appalling abundance.  Their basic thesis, which we find even less palatable from the pen of a foreign observer, is that \"grass roots\" Latin America has little or nothing to do with Western civilization and freedom under the rule of law. Our true \"identity,\" these people argue, would be not only different, but inimical to that ideal, and of course to economic freedom. These authors go on to assert that obscurantist tyrants are the true heroes of Latin American history.  Mr. Crassweller is aware of this polemic, and he takes sides in it. For him, Mr. Peron\\'s rise to power was, for Argentina, \"a renunciation of spiritual kinship with Europe and a cry for the truly indigenous, for Creole reality and Creole myth.\" Mr. and Mrs. Peron, he writes, had an \"almost preternatural understanding of the popular {Argentine} psyche, {an} emotional rapport with Argentine civilization.\"  What does not stand out with sufficient clarity in this book is that intellectual and political modernizers (among them Jorge Luis Borges) are also part of Argentina, indeed the better part. Mr. Crassweller does speak of a \"great rift\" that has divided Argentine society for more than a century -- on one side the join-the-West modernizers, on the other the \"true Creoles.\" Actually, the matter was not so stated until after 1920, when the liberal political order founded by the Westernizers in the mid-19th century, up to then a brilliant success, began to falter. It was then that some Argentine writers began to idealize the Indians and the mestizo cowboys called gauchos, and to pillory the modernizers as \"foreign agents,\" thereby sowing ideas that were later to be seized by Mr. Peron and that remain virulent to this day.  Before that revision, Argentina felt and was proudly Western. It is true that the Argentine liberal system was an oligarchic democracy, with very limited franchise. But that had begun to be corrected by universal suffrage in 1916. It was a process that could have been set back on course if Mr. Peron had been a believer in democracy instead of an unscrupulous and unprincipled demagogue, who found in Mussolini-style fascism a rationale for his penchant for autocracy.  Then there is Mr. Crassweller\\'s candid account of Mr. Peron in action. As the strong man in President Edelmiro J. Farrell\\'s military government beginning in 1943, he built up the corrupt and irresponsible Peronist labor movement that would be the backbone of his power, and he set out to destroy all those who opposed him. Mr. Crassweller records that under the state of siege imposed by Mr. Farrell in September 1945 at Mr. Peron\\'s instigation, \"umbrella arrests were carried out. They covered the full gamut -- politicians, intellectuals, engineers, educators, lawyers, journalists, doctors\" -- in brief, the most civilized and democratic-minded men in Argentina.  Between this crackdown and Mr. Peron\\'s anointment as elected president, there was one serious attempt to stop him by his fellow officers, who were by now thoroughly alarmed. He was forced to leave the government and to resign from the army, and was even briefly detained. But by then Peronism had become, in Mr. Crassweller\\'s words, a \"house under whose wide roof the outsiders, the wounded, the impotent, the resentful\" had congregated. There took place that famous rally on Oct. 17, 1945, when hundreds of thousands converged on downtown Buenos Aires and would not disperse (and could at any moment have rioted) until Mr. Peron was released and shown to them from the balcony of the presidential palace. Yet that huge show of strength plus the full panoply of state intimidation yielded Mr. Peron only 52.4% of the vote in the 1946 election. And six years later, with the country in a state of internal war that allowed Mr. Peron to imprison his opponents at will, he was reelected with only 64%.  There had developed in the meantime a swift process of economic ruin and public and private corruption, a grotesque personality cult, and a repressive and authoritarian accretion in which (in Mr. Crassweller\\'s chilling words), \"there was no hint of a grand design. Rather, it was as if the civilization itself were releasing something from its depths.\" It could not be put better, except for the use of the word civilization. It was the culture that had belched. Civilization was just trying to survive until better times.  --- Mr. Rangel is a Venezuelan author based in Caracas. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0135': 'Raises Question Of Regulation --- West German Companies\\' Free Rein in Operating Bank Activities is Cited --- By Terence Roth Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> The suspected foreign-exchange fraud at Volkswagen AG has raised the question of whether West German companies\\' internal banking operations should be reined in.  Banking analysts specifically cite a lack of regulation of corporate currency operations, which have surged in volume as West Germany\\'s major companies have expanded abroad in the past two decades.  West German companies essentially regulate their banking activities themselves. Corporate accounts are policed by outside auditors, who have an unofficial watchdog function. But in the case of VW, auditors didn\\'t discover the auto maker\\'s open currency position until fraudulent forward dollar contracts came due and were rejected by banks, which had no record of the transactions.  \"Many auditors studying company accounts often don\\'t know enough about complicated currency instruments to catch possible problems,\" said Prof. Karl-Werner Schulte, a management instructor at the European Business School in Oestrich-Winkel.  VW last week reported that \"criminal manipulation\" in its huge foreign-exchange positions has cost it as much as $259 million. The fraud, which is being investigated by local and federal authorities, has prompted the resignation of VW\\'s chief financial officer and the ouster of its foreign-exchange manager.  German companies with at least 50% of their revenue generated abroad, such as VW, trade in billions of dollars annually, often taking hedged positions to protect against erratic currency shifts. But the rules that regulate banks\\' currency positions don\\'t apply to corporations.  \"Non-banks have no regulatory controls in this respect, and it becomes a problem when they effectively trade like a bank, but aren\\'t required to act like one,\" said a Frankfurt bank economist.  Rules laid down by West Germany\\'s bank regulator, the Supervisory Office for Credit Business in West Berlin, require banks\\' foreign-exchange operations to account for their currency assets and liabilities at the end of every trading day. The regulators also establish a system of checks and balances for bank currency trading, including the division of functions between dealer, executor and booking of transactions.  However, most analysts say that even the most rigorous management and government controls can\\'t always prevent the kind of fraud -- by way of doctored computer programs and erased data banks -- said to have caused VW\\'s foreign-exchange loss.  Even so, the opposition Social Democratic Party has submitted to Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg a list of questions concerning the VW case. Opposition officials indicate that the VW situation is further evidence of the need to bring the expanded bank-like operations of West Germany\\'s big industry into tighter controls.  \"We are going to carefully study the questions arising out of the VW affair,\" said Uwe Jens, senior Social Democratic member of parliament\\'s economics committee. \"If large corporations are developing sideline banking operations, now may be the time to expand the banking laws to cover those operations.\"  If banking laws are enacted to cover corporate finance operations, the change would require a legislative amendment to West German banking laws. With the VW case only a week old, it\\'s too early to talk about pending legislation. But West Germany has a proven record of ushering in new laws in reaction to economic scandal.  The VW case, which is believed to be the worst case of foreign-exchange manipulation on record, has prompted management experts to reexamine the role of comptrollers in West German companies. Currently, the role of comptroller isn\\'t emphasized in German management structure.  In the U.S., the comptroller is responsible for monitoring and auditing a company\\'s cash and payments positions. In West Germany, when a company doesn\\'t have such a position, the managing board member for finance commonly acts as an unofficial comptroller.  Ironically, VW\\'s former chief financial officer, Rolf Selowsky, who resigned over the weekend, last year had objected to plans by VW\\'s chairman, Carl H. Hahn, to appoint a comptroller for VW. The comptroller, who would have encroached on Mr. Selowsky\\'s responsibilities, would have, among other things, assumed direct control of the company\\'s cash and foreign currency positions.  The resignation of Mr. Selowsky, who was scheduled to retire in six weeks, and the suspensions of two senior executives working under him, suggested management failure to prevent the suspected currency fraud.  --- VW and Hungarian Bank Special to The Wall Street Journal  FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The National Bank of Hungary\\'s name was used on forged documents apparently linked to the suspected foreign-exchange fraud at Volkswagen AG, a local representative of the bank said.  He added that the Hungarian bank helped identify falsified documents presented to it by VW. The representative, who declined to be identified, said the bank had no part in any wrongdoing.  Der Spiegel, a West German magazine, has reported that VW\\'s suspicion of criminal action in the case solidified on Feb. 18, when the National Bank of Hungary declined to recognize a dollar futures contract that VW\\'s records showed it had.

       " 'WSJ870317-0133': 'Vast New Wallace Wing Opens at Met Museum --- By Manuela Hoelterhoff</HL> At a recent party for the huge new 20th-century wing at the Metropolitan Museum, the deceased donor of this art hangar was praised for sharing her \"wealth and vision.\" Lila Acheson Wallace\\'s wealth had never been in doubt. But that night her Reader\\'s Digest millions were bodied forth in 60,000 square feet of exhibition space, which cost $26 million, $11 million of it Wallace money. Her vision, though, did not hit you in the eye.  The checks bought a barn of a wing for a collection as spotty as a Dalmatian and not half as beautiful. Reluctant to mix its historical mission with contemporary work, the Met has relied on haphazard donations and didn\\'t open a department of 20th-century art until 1970. This attitude left it far behind in the feverish race to collect 20th-century art. The Wallace wing is obviously a sign of a major conversion, a major committment to the century of Picasso and Pollock and Johns. But that century will be over in less than 13 years. Even if something had to be done for \"our time\" before it became \"the past\" -- why so much space for so little content?  The best way to make sense out of the puzzling Wallace wing is to see it as the last bulge in the Met\\'s master plan for expansion conceived under megalomaniacal former director Thomas Hoving, that figment of \\'60s optimism and arrogance who is now praising luxury consumption and lambasting other museum directors as editor of Connoisseur magazine.  Mr. Hoving\\'s plan has been inflating toward completion since 1970, in a series of glass-walled wings designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates. Soon the museum\\'s park facade will be almost completely obscured by the firm\\'s nondescript structures, in particular the Robert Lehman Wing. Finished in 1975, this diamond-shaped vacuity should have been a warning to the museum about the perils of accepting big, highly restricted gifts designed to glorify the donor in perpetuity.  Until the Wallace wing, the creepy Lehman cenotaph was the most debatable part of the expansion. When Lehman trustees threatened to ship the collection, kit and caboodle, to another city, the Met tied down the goods by meeting conditions that make telling commentary on death-transcending egomania disguised as patronage: House the works in a wing embellished with the banker\\'s name and position it on axis with the Fifth Avenue entrance. Only public protest kept Mr. Hoving from ripping out the glorious Grand Staircase so that visitors could whiz into Lehman\\'s memorial unobstructed. There was the feeling then that the Met was just a wee eager, and even today one can\\'t help thinking that, remarkable as many works are, the collection in toto doesn\\'t merit the space.  Similar thoughts overwhelm a visitor to the Wallace wing. The entrance is uninspiring. We see the door to the men\\'s room and a water fountain. To the left, there is a very long sales desk. In addition to the usual gewgaws and posters it offers \"Pablo,\" a kit that says you can make art by fitting together the provided bits and pieces. Such a delusionary concept of creativity is not restricted to purchasers. Just around a few corners is a large-scale \"Robert\" -- a big, shoebox-shaped room stuffed with odds and ends by Robert Rauschenberg. The vaguely biographical display (shirts, books, photographs) looks like an M.F.A. project by a sloppy student and is an attempt to fill up this awkward special exhibitions space.  Centrally imbedded in the first floor, \"Robert\" sticks out like a big sore toe, and you keep hitting it because the floor plan is so confusing. Architect Roche has shaped painting galleries that are pleasingly proportioned and sympathetically lit. But because of their contents, these galleries don\\'t unfold in a historically meaningful way.  The first two rooms are typical. They mix European and American paintings and they\\'re too uneven in quality to engage in any compelling transatlantic dialogue. One lingers happily over Pierre Bonnard\\'s melancholic \"Woman with Mimosa,\" and turns speedily from a particularly dreary group of freaks by James Ensor.  Criticism may abate in front of the spectacular wall of Picassos, which includes the portrait of chunky Gertrude Stein ready to do battle with the world of words. But such major works also point up glaring gaps. You could not surmise that Europe\\'s cubist and expressionist movements were the penetrating influences on 20th-century art from the Met\\'s paltry assortment. What the Met has a lot of are early- and mid-20th century works by American painters. There\\'s nothing wrong with that, except many are as dull as Walt Kuhn\\'s \"Apples from Maine,\" and the profusion contrasts weirdly with the skimpy space reserved for the decorative arts.  Design arguably affects us more directly than paintings. Yet the museum only needs one room to detail this century\\'s \"Decorative and Industrial Design.\" The result (can it be otherwise?) is a hideous hodgepodge of chairs, lamps and tables.  If this is depressing, brace yourself for what lies ahead on the mezzanine level and the second floor. The blue-painted room displaying the Berggruen Klee Collection is an intimate enough space for viewing Paul Klee\\'s poignant whimsies, despite the egregious linking of donor and artist names. (Can\\'t people give art away these days without slapping their names over it or buying a wing? Long forgotten is the modest example of Louisine Havemeyer, whose extraordinary bequest to the Met in the 1920s didn\\'t come wrapped in self-promoting strings.  Given the simple pleasantness of the Klee room, you wonder how the same architect could shape the claustrophobic sculpture gallery a few yards away. Narrow and high, it looks like a loading dock. Any minute strong men in vans will take away these heaps of steel and wood.  Revive your spirit for a moment by ascending to the second floor. Here is the collection\\'s mid-century masterpiece, Jackson Pollock\\'s \"Autumn Rhythm,\" hung a little high, but still exhilarating. Curiously, though, neither Pollock nor even Willem de Kooning takes center stage at the Met. The artist who through sheer profusion of works (seven! canvases donated last year by his widow) seems to be promoted to Genius of the Century is Clyfford Still. Yes, one-note Clyff, who painted flames with the obsession of a bonkers fireman. Still always thought he was too exalted to show with other artists, and a display like this one makes you wonder about the nature of the bequest. There is no canvas by fellow transcendentalist Barnett Newman.  Of course, nothing in the Wallace wing is stuck to the walls permanently, and eventually the Met will rotate some works and no doubt be given others. But the problems here go beyond quibbles over why one artist has been hung and not the other. The real question is, why this wing? The best pieces could easily have been grouped together and shown more effectively in a smaller space not costing about $1 million annually to operate. Why create a vacuum so you can fill it? New York has no shortage of exhibition opportunities for 20th-century art, but far fewer places for works plucked from the matrix of European civilization. The Met\\'s repositories are bursting with masterworks it has no room to show, and the new wing was, in fact, originally meant to alleviate this space crunch.  In the original master plan, what is now the Wallace wing was earmarked for the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, which could have filled every acre with its 60,000 pieces ranging from Florentine statues and French fans to German furniture. (The department now is able to show only 30% of its collectionless if you subtract the quality snuffboxes, timepieces and porcelains stuck in old-fashioned vitrines in the infrequently open basement galleries.) But the fortunes of this treasure-stuffed, scholarly department waned with the lurching growth of the 20th-century department.  Money, of course, drove this growth. Money from people like Mrs. Wallace and her advisers, who think space is better spent showing a Julian Schnabel painting covered with broken plates than a remarkable collection of perfect Meissen porcelain.  Perhaps the Met has the wrong friends. In what amounted to a popularity contest settled by the Wallace millions, the 20th-century department chewed off one floor and then gobbled up the whole wing. ESDA will receive some new galleries in the old building and a pied-a-terre in a still-unbuilt winglet that completes the master plan. It\\'s still not enough room for a department intended to survey the embellishment of Europe from the early Renaissance to the fin de siecle. Already, squeezing ESDA\\'s galleries into this winglet has meant cutting down on a projected spacious garden court with French sculptures that could have been one of the museum\\'s memorable spaces. The Met needs to ponder its priorities. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0132': 'Canada\\'s Edper Runs Its Immense Holdings With One-Two Punch --- Gruff Cockwell, Social Eyton Stand Behind Bronfmans; Power Gives Rise to Fear --- The Loyalty and the Intimacy --- By Jacquie McNish Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Peter and Edward Bronfman bear a famous business name, but they never had much taste for business. They seemed destined for a life of uneventful coupon-clipping until the day they met an ambitious young accountant named Jack Cockwell.  The brothers had inherited about $25 million (U.S.) of Seagram Co. stock in the 1950s, but control of the company had gone to another branch of the Bronfman clan. Peter and Edward lived on their dividends, investing the surplus haphazardly in such things as bowling alleys in Quebec and an inactive stock exchange in Trinidad.  Mr. Cockwell was 27 years old when Touche Ross &amp; Co. assigned him in 1968 to audit one of Peter and Edward\\'s companies. Disturbed by the weak state of their investments, the newly arrived immigrant from South Africa spent his spare evenings advising them. \"I guess I thought we could lose it all any day,\" recalls Peter Bronfman. The brothers hired Mr. Cockwell a year later to manage their investments.  The marriage of Bronfman money and Mr. Cockwell\\'s skill has created a corporate empire that now commands more than $38 billion (U.S.) in assets. It is so powerful that many Canadians agree with Donald Blenkarn, the chairman of Parliament\\'s finance committee, that it has \"too much control in the Canadian business world.\"  The brothers\\' privately held Edper Enterprises Ltd. controls about two dozen publicly traded companies, including Canada\\'s largest public mining company, Noranda Inc.; its largest public real-estate development company, Trizec Corp.; and its largest public forest-products company, MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.  Edper owns so many large financial institutions that the government recently proposed laws to prevent other conglomerates from gaining such financial clout. The group issues so many shares that it has forced new practices on the Canadian securities industry. \"The kind of power we have creates fear and paranoia about us,\" concedes Kenneth Clarke, the president and chief executive officer of Great Lakes Group Inc., an Edper-controlled utility and financial-services concern.  Peter and Edward Bronfman are an unlikely pair of corporate swashbucklers. Rather than fire a reckless chauffeur, Peter used to drive his car himself while the chauffeur sat in the passenger seat. The brothers live more modestly than most of their executives and are so shy that neither has been interviewed by the press since 1979.  \"I am not a corporate animal,\" 57-year-old Peter Bronfman says in written replies to questions submitted by this newspaper. Edward Bronfman, 59, declines any comment.  Although the brothers are sometimes portrayed as brilliant financiers, they tend to rubber-stamp Mr. Cockwell\\'s decisions. They are briefed regularly, but associates say they have vetoed a Cockwell decision only twice. And except for the 1971 acquisition of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, Peter Bronfman says, \"practically everything else Jack initiated.\"  Many heirs employ professional managers but rarely allow them to take such risks. The brothers neither slammed on the brakes nor sought to join the fun as Mr. Cockwell steered them through a series of highly leveraged and controversial transactions. \"It took a lot of fortitude to basically give up operating control of their fortune,\" says Michael Sanderson, the chairman and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.\\'s Canadian unit.  Peter currently has voting control of Edper. He and Edward each have three children and envision a day when six cousins would probably have difficulty agreeing on anything. So they are casting about, executives say, for ways in which Edward\\'s children can sell some of their stake in the company but leave control with Peter\\'s family.  \"It\\'s conceivable that Edper may go public,\" says its president, J. Trevor Eyton. As preparation for such a step, this year\\'s internal annual report was produced using guidelines that apply to public companies.  Power is so diffused among Edper\\'s top half-dozen executives that sometimes it is hard to tell who is in charge. President Eyton, 52, is widely perceived as the group\\'s chief strategist, but insiders credit Mr. Cockwell, 46, with building the management team, initiating most strategies and creating most of the group\\'s innovative financings. At board meetings Mr. Cockwell answers most questions, and he often corrects Mr. Eyton in front of analysts. Says Alan Hockin, the dean of administrative studies at Toronto\\'s York University and a director of one Edper company: \"Jack is the real power behind the throne.\"  But Mr. Cockwell has long been uncomfortable in the limelight because of his thick South African accent and because he evidently realizes that his blunt, aggressive manner wins few friends. In a rare public appearance last year before Mr. Blenkarn\\'s parliamentary committee, Mr. Cockwell so offended committee members that Mr. Blenkarn says: \"They should keep that guy in the back, back, back room.\"  Mr. Cockwell even shuns the limelight at the office. He has made friends promise never to surprise him with a party, and he holds no rank higher than deputy chairman or chief operating officer in Edper companies. He declined to be interviewed for this article and referred all questions to Mr. Eyton.  A persuasive lawyer with impeccable social connections, Mr. Eyton was the Bronfman brothers\\' outside counsel until he was hired in 1979 to balance Mr. Cockwell\\'s gruffness. He is Edper\\'s diplomat, salesman and media star. He has been photographed eating his favorite cookies and riding a tandem bike and has been depicted as Toronto\\'s \"most influential person.\" He typically makes the first approach to an outside company for a sale or acquisition, then Mr. Cockwell steps in for hard bargaining over financial details. \"They\\'re the best one-two punch in Canada,\" says Merrill Lynch\\'s Mr. Sanderson.  Other Edper executives closely resemble Messrs. Cockwell and Eyton. Most are accountants, often from Touche Ross, and several are South Africans. A few come from Mr. Eyton\\'s former law firm, Tory, Tory, Deslauriers &amp; Binnington. Mr. Cockwell was an amateur boxer and rugby player in South Africa -- his ears still bear the scars of college boxing bouts -- and his fellow executives all share his passion for strenuous sport. A company soccer game last year got so rough that Mr. Cockwell broke his collarbone and an associate broke an ankle.  Edper executives are discouraged from investing outside the empire and are required to disclose their personal finances. They also are encouraged to discuss intimate personal goals at formal career-planning sessions. Wendy Cecil-Stuart, an Edper vice president, told Mr. Cockwell at one such session that she contemplated becoming a single mother. He said he was planning to separate from his wife and asked her for a date. The couple now have a seven-month-old daughter and plan to be married when Mr. Cockwell\\'s divorce is completed.  Executive loyalty at Edper is reinforced by an unusual compensation plan that Mr. Cockwell set the pattern for in 1974. He borrowed $1.2 million that year to invest in Mico Enterprises Ltd., an investment concern that he had just persuaded the Bronfmans to acquire. With a salary then of $20,000 a year, he was betting everything he owned on the brothers\\' success. Today senior executives must buy stakes in the ventures that they operate. The required commitments average $750,000, yet salaries rarely exceed $75,000.  To help finance such purchases, Edper\\'s stock plan allows executives to obtain what are, in effect, five-year interest-free loans from their companies. At Hees International Corp., the financial-services concern that holds, directly or indirectly, most of Edper\\'s interests in public companies, executives now own 10% of 30.3 million shares outstanding. Mr. Cockwell\\'s holdings in Edper companies currently have a market value of $30.8 million.  \"People aren\\'t here because they want to build a dynasty for Edward and Peter; they\\'re here for themselves,\" says Great Lakes Group\\'s Mr. Clarke. So Edper managers set an exhausting pace.  When Edper took control in 1983 of Royal Trustco Ltd., a sleepy Toronto trust company, that company\\'s executives began finding pointedly worded memos taped to their chairs if they arrived in the office after 7:30 a.m. The demands of a 12-hour day \"put enormous strain on my family life and personal health,\" recalls Ian Young, who resigned as a senior vice president of Royal Trustco after two years without a holiday.  But few senior executives leave Edper\\'s fold by choice because it is difficult to match the compensation and autonomy they enjoy. Apart from occasional telephone calls and meetings, the Bronfmans seldom interfere. \"They talk to us, they take an interest in what we\\'re doing, and then they give us enough rope to hang ourselves,\" says David Kerr, an Edper executive vice president.  Winning so much trust from the brothers didn\\'t come easily at first. One of Mr. Cockwell\\'s initial proposals was that Peter and Edward sell their Seagram shares and invest in companies that they could control. The brothers resisted the plan until 1971 because the Seagram stake was \"an umbilical cord to their past,\" recalls Timothy Price, the president of Hees International.  But the brothers agreed to begin selling the shares in the early \\'70s after Mr. Cockwell rescued many of their troubled investments. Once the shares were sold, Mr. Cockwell used the proceeds to begin a series of leveraged acquisitions of marginally profitable public companies. His strategy was to acquire controlling interests in large real-estate, natural-resource and financial-services companies that could dominate their industries. Acquired companies were revived through financings structured by Mr. Cockwell.  The first major takeover was of Calgary-based Trizec in 1976. Edper soon discovered that Trizec was so short of cash it couldn\\'t meet its payroll. Hees\\'s Mr. Price says the company was saved at the last moment when a bank agreed to Edper\\'s proposal for what amounted to a long-term fixed-rate loan.  Since Trizec was acquired, all of Edper\\'s public companies have enjoyed increases in the market value of their stock. The group\\'s only major disappointment has been Noranda, the mining, manufacturing and forest-products company that was bought in 1979. It reported losses in four straight years before earning the equivalent of $32.6 million in 1986.  Edper\\'s affiliated companies issued $2.6 billion in preferred and common stock over the past three years, or 14% of all such equity raised in Canada. This has given it controversial power in the securities industry. It was Edper that gave Toronto\\'s Gordon Capital Corp. the idea of introducing \"bought deals\" into Canada. In these transactions, securities companies buy entire issues as principals instead of simply agreeing to sell them as agents.  A bought deal, though routine in the U.S., is riskier for securities dealers because they can suffer big losses during an issue if the stock\\'s price falls. But Gordon was persuaded to proceed with such deals when Edper\\'s Hees agreed to temporarily buy, at whatever price the stock might have fallen to, any stock that Gordon couldn\\'t sell elsewhere. This applied not only to stock of Edper companies but to stock of other companies as well. Hees\\'s support helped reduce Gordon\\'s losses on sour deals, giving the then-small securities dealer the needed insurance to arrange bought deals for dozens of companies.  Gordon has since emerged as one of the country\\'s major securities dealers, and the industry has witnessed a wave of takeovers and mergers as competing dealers scrambled to increase their capital to provide the service. \"We were trying to put the teeth back in underwriting,\" explains Hees\\'s Mr. Price.  Edper has other ways to ease its outpouring of new shares. Affiliated companies bought 51% of a $113 million preferred-share issue by Royal Trustco in 1984, when the trust company was loading the market with several equity issues to strengthen its capital basis. Such support, concedes Mr. Price, \"can help an issue that may not go very well.\"  Intercorporate holdings can benefit the empire in another way: Canadian corporations don\\'t pay income tax on dividends from shares they hold in other companies, and they may deduct from income the interest paid on money they borrow to buy the shares.  Extensive use of these tax advantages has minimized taxes for Edper companies. In 1986 two major Edper holding companies, Hees and Carena-Bancorp Inc., didn\\'t pay any income tax although they reported combined profits equivalent to $111.3 million. \"It\\'s unconscionable that they pay so little tax,\" says Parliament\\'s Mr. Blenkarn.  Several of Canada\\'s largest business conglomerates are controlled by individual families, but Edper\\'s swift growth and bold practices make it the No. 1 target of Canadian critics of corporate concentration. In lobbying Ottawa to dismantle financial conglomerates, Canada\\'s banks have repeatedly warned about the potential for self-dealing between Edper\\'s companies.  Peter Bronfman says he is \"uncomfortable with the high profile\" Edper has these days, but adds, \"I\\'m just so pleased that things have worked out the way they have. It\\'s far better than we ever hoped.\"  (See: \"Corrections &amp; Amplifications: Molson Cos.\" -- WSJ March 19, 1987) ',\n",

London shares also retreated, awaiting the British budget due today.  Tokyo trading was heavy but mixed as the Nikkei stock average, which rose 27.75 points Friday, fell 82.58 to 21,415.37. The stock exchange index fell 4.45 to 1840.46. Volume was about 1.1 billion shares, down from 1.3 billion Friday.  Stocks edged lower across the board in generally lackluster trading, which analysts said was a cautious response to last week\\'s parade of record closes, analysts said. Investor sentiment is bullish, although it suffers from lack of market-moving news, they said.  The Nikkei average will resume its climb once the market rouses itself from current doldrums, traders said. Investor sentiment will be pegged to performances in overseas markets this week, they said.  Meanwhile, London shares ended lower on modest profit-taking in advance of today\\'s unveiling of the British budget.  The 100-share index, off Friday\\'s 2000 close from the start, fell 8.2 points to 1991.8. The Financial Times industrial-share index fell 7.3 to 1,576.6.  The weakness largely reflected selling by market makers rather than institutional investors, a dealer said. \"Everyone\\'s hopeful that tomorrow will be a very good budget, but nobody wants to get involved\" before then, a trader said.  Also, the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget, another dealer said. \"It\\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level,\" he said. The 100-share index is up 18.6% this year.  The budget is expected to include tax cuts and a reduction in the government\\'s deficit target, which analysts expect will pave the way for at least another half a percentage point cut in banks\\' basic lending rate, which was reduced to 10.5% from 11% earlier this month.  Finally, the budget\\'s arrival could benefit British government bonds more than equities, a dealer said.  Wall Street\\'s lower opening contributed to the selling. Friday\\'s withdrawal from market making by Midland Bank PLC\\'s Greenwell Montagu securities unit depressed sentiment somewhat as well, some dealers said. Greenwell probably will have to unload some positions, although sales are likely to be gradual and shouldn\\'t upset the market, they said.  The retail sector was among the weakest. Profit-taking there was fueled by growing expectations that the budget will cut the basic tax rate to 27% rather than to as low as 25%, a dealer said. The possibility of the 25% rate kept retail stocks \"very hot indeed\" in recent weeks, another dealer said.  The gold mines index, which rose 8.8 points Friday, eased 1.8 to 338.3.  Here are price trends on the world\\'s major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.

       " 'WSJ870317-0130': 'Paul Tsongas: Gadfly on Corporate Board --- By David Wessel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> When Paul E. Tsongas said he wouldn\\'t seek reelection to the Senate in 1984, he was inundated with calls from companies eager to name him to their boards.  One came from the president of Boston Edison Co. It\\'s probably a call he wishes he never made.  Using tactics more common to Capitol Hill than Boston\\'s discreet board rooms, Mr. Tsongas is trying to persuade the utility\\'s management that it\\'s botching perhaps its most important job: getting along with state regulators.  The other day, Mr. Tsongas faced television cameras and, choosing words he knew would get him on the 6 p.m. news, said Edison has a choice to make: \"It can choose the Donald Regan road: slow, defensive, self-protective and destined to fail. Or it can choose the Howard Baker road: alert, pro-active, pragmatic and sensitive to the real world.\"  Afterward, one of Mr. Tsongas\\'s partners at the Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot, told him: \"You\\'ve been invited to join your last corporate board.\"  Mr. Tsongas says he is puzzled by such observations. \"Is what I\\'m doing in the shareholders\\' best interest? Then what\\'s the problem?\"  A popular Democrat, 46-year-old Mr. Tsongas left politics after learning that he had cancer and deciding that he wanted more time for his family. His cancer has responded to bone marrow transplants, and he now advises Foley Hoag clients on coping with government, dabbles in real estate development and sits on the boards of Edison, Wang Laboratories Inc., M/A Com Inc., Thermo Analytical Corp. and Shawmut Corp.  \"I initially decided when I went on these boards that I would keep my mouth shut and acknowledge that I didn\\'t know things,\" he says. At Edison, at least, it hasn\\'t worked out that way.  All this began last summer when state regulators rejected an Edison rate-increase request, accused Edison executives of failing to manage the company properly and pointedly delivered a copy of their decision to each director. Mr. Tsongas offered to chair a board committee to review the agency\\'s complaints \"on condition that we bring in somebody to do a cold analysis, that they have total independence and that we go public with it.\"  Earlier this month, the review team appointed by Mr. Tsongas\\'s committee -- a Harvard professor, a conservation-minded lawyer and a former New Jersey utility executive -- released its report, blasting the utility for its \"excessively adversarial\" stance toward regulators and an unduly skeptical view of conservation programs. In a suggestion that has some outside directors seething, the panel told Edison to bring in someone from outside the company as its No. 2 executive, to assume responsibility for regulatory relations and conservation programs.  Some directors privately accuse the panel of overstepping its charge. Edison\\'s president and chief executive officer, Stephen J. Sweeney, wouldn\\'t appear at a news conference at which the panel disclosed its findings. But Mr. Tsongas showed up to embrace the recommendations.  \"Tsongas is a real sharp political cookie,\" says Douglas Foy, the lawyer on the review team. \"He understands that this Department of Public Utilities is going to cook Edison if they don\\'t start changing. I don\\'t think the rest of the board did. He needed some ammunition to make the case for change.\"  Mr. Tsongas\\'s critics on the board aren\\'t talking, and the company -- which is still weighing the review panel\\'s report -- says executives won\\'t talk about individual directors. But Nelson Gifford, an Edison director and chairman of Dennison Manufacturing Co., calls Mr. Tsongas \"a breath of fresh air in a board room.\" Mr. Gifford says Mr. Tsongas argues persuasively: \"Never mind what the facts are. You\\'ve got to deal with the perceptions out there.\"  After two years in the board room, Mr. Tsongas says he is impressed with the minds of some of his fellow directors, the best of whom have \"sheer intelligence and depth\" that exceeds what he saw in Congress. \"I sometimes sit there and say, \\'Gee, if I were president, he\\'d be the secretary of the treasury.\\'\"  But he also finds himself impatient with the slow pace and gentility of corporate boards. \"Issues are confronted,\" he says. \"But the extent to which they\\'re confronted is not what I would have expected.  \"I spent 15 years in politics where issues are hammered out in intense debate. I happen to think it\\'s very healthy,\" he says.  He has seen politicians suffer for their mistakes in public and, now, he has participated in discussions about raises for executives in private -- and says politicians have the tougher time. \"Business isn\\'t as Darwinian in terms of personnel as politics is,\" he says.  What does he have to say to shareholders about the quality of the directors who represent them? \"Have faith in the sheer talent. Have less faith in the camaraderie.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0125': 'A New Latin Hero Has a Message for Capitalists --- By George Melloan</HL> Hernando de Soto, a 45-year-old Peruvian, is a revolutionary intellectual -- but not the usual kind. Peru has the usual kind too, a bloodthirsty Marxist bunch known as \"El Sendero Luminoso,\" or \"The Shining Path.\" Mr. de Soto\\'s manifesto is called \"El Otro Sendero,\" \"The Other Path.\" It has reached the top of the best-seller lists in Peru and Colombia and has become the object of fierce political debate throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Soon there will be Portuguese and English editions. His revolutionary prescription? Capitalism. Norteamericanos can learn a lot from Hernando de Soto. The reason capitalism has failed so badly in Latin America, he says, is that it hasn\\'t really been tried. What passes for capitalism is in fact mercantilism, economic control exercised by a combined business-governmental elite. Yankees reading his arguments may conclude that their own system is not immune to the problem.  In North American terms, Mr. de Soto would be called a populist, much as, say, Thomas Jefferson or James Madison were invidiously labeled with that term by European royalty in the 18th century. He defends the \"informal sector,\" or in more familiar terms, the black market. In Lima, entrepreneurs operate outside the law in activities ranging all the way from street vending to operating bus lines to building houses and apartment buildings. They do this because they can\\'t afford to wade through huge tangles of red tape and regulation to become legal. The red tape was put there by existing elites to limit competition and prevent the ascendancy of a nouveau-riche class. To the informals, survival is the only real issue.  Even though it is outside the law, Peru\\'s informal sector has advanced, even to the point of running its own primitive banking, legal and insurance systems. But without legitimacy, its entrepreneurs cannot obtain the capital necessary to create large organizations. Thus, they are not a serious competitive threat to existing state and private oligopolies. Economic development suffers, as it does in many other \"less-developed\" countries for much the same reason. Public frustration sows the seeds for Marxist revolution, which, of course, only erects new barriers.  Latin American social and political structures have evolved out of authoritarian origins. The U.S. was luckier. Its early settlers developed habits of independence, embraced the populist and democratic philosophies that were welling up against the monarchies of Europe and, ultimately, broke their ties with Europe\\'s elites through armed revolution. Economic rights were accorded constitutional status. When Americans began to build large, ambitious enterprises, very little stood in their way. The end product was the most powerful national economy the world has ever seen.  But one only has to look at the legal problems small businesses in the U.S. face today -- federal regulations, liability suits, tax-code complexities and government protections and subsidies to politically effective interests -- to see that Mr. de Soto\\'s message has meaning in the U.S., too. Much sand has been thrown into the American economic machinery in the past 15 years. Its disappointing performance in the 1970s raised discontents not unlike those in Peru. Some American business leaders are not above alliances with politicians, under the guise of \"industrial policy\" or some other euphemism, to smother competition.  Hernando de Soto first outlined his theories to me four years ago at a beach restaurant lit by torches flickering in the Pacific breezes that blow in toward Lima in the evenings. His grass-roots approach to economics was refreshing. Hernando is himself a member of the Peruvian elite, the son of a one-time secretary to the president and later ambassador. He studied in Peru and Europe, winning a master\\'s degree in international law and economics in Geneva.  After a sojourn in Europe he returned to Peru to start a mining concern and renew a longstanding interest in social and economic problems. In 1979, he created a sensation by inviting 20 street vendors to a symposium on \"Democracy and the Market Economy\" attended by local dignitaries and prominent European intellectuals, among them Nobel Prize winner Friedrich A. von Hayek and Jean-Francois Revel. Who better understood economics than street vendors? The vendors were grateful that someone was finally asking what it was like to scrabble for a living in Peru.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. de Soto formed the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (IDS) to delve into the workings of the informal sector in search of clues as to why bustling Lima is so bereft of more advanced forms of economic development. His institute deployed college students to go out and learn what the informal sector was up against. Among the findings: These well-educated youths were forced to spend 289 days filling out forms and meeting other requirements just to start a small clothing factory. They received 24 bribe solicitations. Setting up a public-transport company cost them 1,000 days. It became easy to see why there were so few legal enterprises in Peru.  Mr. de Soto has become something of a folk hero to the informals. Indeed, some of his Marxist detractors refer to him wryly as the patron saint of the entrepreneurial class. Recently, for example, 300,000 informal transport drivers got up the money to put a full-page ad in El Comercio, a Lima newspaper, with the headline \"El Sendero de 300 mil Choferes.\" Citing the research of Mr. de Soto\\'s institute, the ad demanded a reformed national transport policy. Hernando also is attracting attention to the North. The Institute for Contemporary Studies in San Francisco, with the aid of federal and private grants, has just established a new \"International Center for Economic Growth,\" headed by Nicolas Ardito-Barletta, former president of Panama. It will support think tanks throughout the developing world, encouraging them along lines similar to those developed by Peru\\'s IDS.  Mr. de Soto has remarked in his book that the majority of society in less-developed countries is not \"working class\" in the Marxist sense, but rather entrepreneurial and \"bourgeois\" in its interests and world view. \"Thus, any socialist revolution that claims to be \\'proletarian\\' will always represent a dictatorship of a minority of the society over the majority.\" He goes on to say that the attempt to redefine informals as \"proletarians\" irrespective of their entrepreneurial functions itself \"undermines Marxist theory and has been the subject of many bitter polemics within Marxist circles . . . all the polemics have accomplished is to confirm that Marxism has always been a creed of intellectuals who are able to manipulate abstract concepts as necessary for the sake of gaining and holding political power.  \"Political ideologies, although they operate largely in the realm of values and are thus resistant to empirical falsification, cannot survive for long if they clash continually and fundamentally with lived experience.\"  There is a profound message in that last sentence, and not only for Marxists who profess liberation of the workers and then proceed to enslave them. Capitalists who profess free enterprise and then call on government to limit competition have a credibility problem too. Mr. de Soto\\'s revolution cuts several different ways. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0124': 'Now They Can Work on \\'Nasdaq\\' --- By Priscilla Ann Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> It\\'s easy for a little over-the-counter company with a forgettable name to get lost in the vast Nasdaq trading system.  But some small companies on the Nasdaq, home to more than three times as many companies as trade on the New York Stock Exchange, have found a solution: a trading symbol that nobody who learns it is apt to forget.  Thus, Occupational-Urgent Care Health Systems Inc. trades as OUCH; Roadrunner Enterprises Inc., a flat-bed trucking company, is BEEP, and Adtec Inc., which makes bars and detention equipment for prisons, is JAIL. (It seems that JAIL is in, these days, on Wall Street. The stock, which began trading at $9.875 Feb. 24, has risen to $11.625.)  Kevin E. Moyles, the research director at JAIL\\'s underwriter, Underwood Neuhaus &amp; Co. in Houston, says Underwood urged the snappy symbol for Adtec \"because the high visibility would help if it did well.\" He adds, however, \"Of course, if a company weren\\'t doing well, a memorable symbol would make it worse.\"  Most Nasdaq symbols have four letters, turning the exchange into a virtual Scrabble Game. There are such mnemonics as PAIN, CURE, CARE and HEAL for health companies; BUGS and PEST for biological- and pesticide-research concerns, and WORM for a farm-equipment company. Pioneer Communications Network Inc., which is developing books based on soap operas, chose SOAP.  Even words with a potentially negative connotation are used. For example, BANG might seem an impolitic choice for a power-plant owner, but it nonetheless was chosen as the symbol for Bangor Hydroelectric Co. And when Bangor America Inc., a fabric maker, went public last year, it selected BAMM.  \"What you want is to make an immediate power of association related to what a company does,\" explained Mr. Moyles. Fertility and Genetics Research Inc. selected BABY; National Reference Publishing Inc. has ZIPP; and Cooper LaserSonics Inc., ZAPS.  Some symbols, however, become unintentionally prophetic. American Equine Products Inc., which picked WHOA for its symbol, has been reined in of late -- with its shares trading at about 62.5 cents each, down from $1.50 last August. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0114': ' Video News Releases</HL> Michael M. Klepper shed some much-needed light on the topic of the video news release (VNR) in \"Getting Your Corporate Message on the Evening News\" (Manager\\'s Journal, Feb. 23), but two of his assertions are debatable.  First, he writes that \"direct mail is usually best\" for delivery of VNRs to news rooms across the country, and recommends satellite distribution for \"hard\" or \"late-breaking\" news stories. I disagree. Mailed tapes are lumped in with audition cassettes from job-seeking reporters and anchors and may take days to make it from the mail room to the news room. Generally, a VNR delivered by mail (even overnight) is perceived as \"yesterday\\'s news.\"  Virtually all commercial TV stations with news rooms are equipped to receive satellite feeds. If your VNR is newsworthy (and, as Mr. Klepper pointed out, it had better be, or you\\'re wasting your time), stations will \"downlink\" your story for consideration. Schedule several satellite feeds to give stations flexibility, and notify the stations of the feed schedule.  Second, Mr. Klepper said a VNR costs $20,000 to $30,000 to produce and distribute. In my experience, satellite-delivered VNRs average half that -- including station notification and research on use.  A large and growing number of corporations use satellites to deliver their news to local TV stations, not because it\\'s a glitzy new technology, but because it provides the most effective and economical distribution.  Robert N. Bass Executive Vice President Public Affairs Satellite System Inc. Washington --- Video news releases can hardly be termed new.

       " 'WSJ870317-0111': '</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Representatives of Latin American debtor countries, saying they need more money to spur economic growth in order to service their foreign debts, warned they will have to reduce interest payments if they can\\'t obtain new international loans.  \"It\\'s impossible to restore growth without a transfer of resources\" said Jose Luis Machinea, president of the Argentine central bank.  While debtor countries have worked to reform their economies and make them more efficient, Western lenders -- particularly commercial banks -- haven\\'t yet fully honored their part of the international debt plan announced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker in autumn 1985, said Latin American and U.S. officials addressing a conference on less-developed country debt organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Mr. Baker\\'s plan calls for debtors to reduce government deficits and open their economies to market forces while Western creditors lend them more money and industrialized-country governments ensure buoyant world economic growth. Brazil\\'s recent suspension of interest payments on $67 billion of its foreign bank debt is prompting many financiers to reevaluate this solution to international debts.  Even U.S. government officials recognize the shortcomings of the Baker plan, although they stress its achievements, too. \"I\\'d agree with others that {the Baker plan} hasn\\'t succeeded as well as intended or as much as many would hope,\" said Paul D. Taylor, deputy assistant secretary for inter-American affairs at the U.S. State Department.  Ted Truman, director in the international finance division at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, said he felt \"some disappointment about the scale and timing\" of commercial bank lending to debtor countries. \"I\\'d agree with Mr. Machinea that some streamlining of the process {of new bank lending to debtor countries} is highly desirable,\" he said.  Borrowing badly needed new money has become an increasingly tortuous and slow process, said Pedro Aspe Armella, Mexico\\'s deputy secretary at the ministry of planning. His government has spent almost a year negotiating and waiting for $6 billion of new bank loans, and a further $8 billion in loans from governments and international agencies.  Argentina could freely borrow $8 billion a year from its creditors prior to 1982; now it takes a year to arrange to borrow $2 billion from the same lenders, said Mario Brodersohn, Argentina\\'s finance minister. \"Can we sustain {our} democratic governments unless we are able to increase the rate of growth and the level of investment?\" Mr. Brodersohn asked.  The senior Brazilian official at the meeting, ambassador to the U.S. Marcilio Marques Moreira, said Brazil needs new money to sustain its democracy and economic growth. His country had suspended interest payments to protect foreign exchange and gold reserves, which had fallen below $4 billion, he said. It was better to take such a move now, rather than run out of reserves in three months\\' time in the middle of protracted negotiations with creditors, Mr. Moreira said.  Brazil doesn\\'t need more austerity, Ambassador Moreira said. While Brazil had declared a moratorium on its foreign bank debt, it couldn\\'t call a moratorium on its social debt, the ambassador said, alluding to the government\\'s obligation to try to improve the lot of the country\\'s poor.  Mr. Moreira said Brazil is \"trying to find a flow of resources that lessens the previous outflow of resources.\" He didn\\'t, however, go as far as Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who said recently that Brazil\\'s annual debt-service payments should be cut to about $6 billion or $7 billion from about $12 billion in 1986.  There was considerable Western sympathy for the views of Latin American debtors. Morris Goldstein, deputy director of research at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, said there is a \"whole problem of financial flows,\" pointing out that the Latin American debtor countries have suffered a considerable net outflow of funds in 1986.  Commercial bankers were generally conspicuous by their absence at the MIT conference, despite the gathering of so many of their biggest borrowing customers.  The few bankers attending weren\\'t ready to be walked over, though. John Ingraham, senior vice president at Citicorp, argued there was a lot of new bank lending to Latin American debtors in many small project loans, debt/equity swaps and other financings to the private sector.  But even some of the commercial banks\\' few representatives at the conference acknowledged the need for new lending. Rimmer de Vries, senior international economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a unit of J.P. Morgan Inc., says new lending to debtor countries is \"the wobbly leg\" of the Baker plan. \"The time has come for an initiative from all the lenders, to see what kind of a menu we can come up with,\" he said.  There\\'s another huge risk threatening the debt problem, Mr. de Vries said. That is that the U.S. -- if it doesn\\'t get the cooperation it needs from other industrialized countries -- could unwind its trade deficit in a deflationary way, strangling exports, growth and the ability to service foreign obligations in debtor countries, he said.

       " 'WSJ870317-0107': 'Mobile Guide: Veterans Day in Alsace --- By Nicholas King</HL> I was sitting in the cathedral of Colmar, halfway up the nave, the long Gothic windows sun-blue in the late autumn mildness, the walls dusty ochre. Here in Alsace there is an atmosphere of historical self-collection, suspension even, as if the place were no more than an illusion separating two old antagonists, not at all like the intense, battle-scarred ground of Lorraine I had just left behind.  Suddenly from the organ came the chorale from Bach\\'s \"Sleepers Wake\" cantata, whose melodic constructions built up in the still air. A couple of women were arranging red carnations on the altar of a side chapel in preparation for a Mass; the next day would be Nov. 11, the anniversary of the World War I armistice that we now call Veterans Day. Outside, a winding street under overhanging timbered gables led past an open air market to the monastery that now sheltered the museum and in particular Mathis Grunewald\\'s masterpiece, the Isenheim altar piece (circa 1515), which is the rock crystal of Alsatian piety, and the artistic jewel for which tourists come to Colmar. That day they were few in number: a German priest in beret and leather jacket over his cassock, a couple of vacant students, and a self-possessed Italian woman in boots and a smart maroon coat who took things seriously, and obviously had come here to \"see.\"  The train left the turreted, step-gabled station of the Kaiser Wilhelm style built in 1907 when Alsace was still German and followed the Rhine plain north to Strasbourg. Even on the horizon, you could see the outline of Strasbourg Cathedral with its single spire and the shape that seems too boxlike because the west front is higher than the nave and is therefore mistaken for it.  I unlocked the station compartment with my luggage in it and walked out into the wide, semicircular Place de la Gare. There was the Hotel Terminus, the Hotel de l\\'Univers and the Hotel des Vosges. The latter looked quieter than the others and had its name in blue neon whereas the others had only white. And since the Vosges was where that early morning I had started from, I strode into its modest vestibule and asked if there was a room for the night. The answer came without reference to a computer screen or even a reservations book, \"Yes.\"  A spindly boy came out from behind a curtain and skirted his mother\\'s desk to take the room key and my suitcase. We rose shakily in the elevator with the familiar grill and dubious latchings and stopped at the fifth floor; then down the dusty blue carpet of the corridor until we reached the gray-painted door of No. 18. The key turned in the lock and the door opened to a room higher than it was wide or long and filled mostly by a wooden bed and a large armoire, a rickety writing table, a chair and a wash basin. Reaching behind voluminous red curtains, my guide opened the double windows, and we both looked down on the walks and lawns of the square I had just crossed, to the station whose two great lighted clocks shone like moons in the dusk.  The next morning the sun still shone, was even softer in fact, filled with a pinkish haze that moved over the placid river Ill and up the long street until it melted in the shadows before the reddish cathedral. The tiled and wattled dormer-crowded roofs of the adjoining houses that overhung their brick and timbered walls were all that was necessary to contribute a medieval feeling to the ancient space.  Inside, that mysterious, matterlike dust that animates the spaces of Gothic cathedrals gave way before the huge architectural clock in the south transept that is a reminder of the days of the 16th century when this was a Protestant church, before Louis XIV incorporated Strasbourg into France and restored it to Catholicism. In the crypt a Requiem Mass was being said for war dead, and I noticed, carved on the surface of a vast pillar of the Romanesque sanctuary, carved directly into the pink stone and not on a plaque, the words, \"In memory of the American dead who gave their lives for the liberation of Alsace -- 1944-45.\"  Alsace more or less escaped the bloodletting of the past 150 years. Its trials came earlier in history, during the hideous religious massacres of the high Renaissance, and especially during the Thirty Years\\' War. Before that, Strasbourg was an imperial free city for many centuries, and if you run across a local nobleman, his title is unlikely to be of French origin: He will be a count or baron of the Holy Roman Empire. One of them had once shown me a wing of his castle not far away that had been burned by Swedish troops under Gustavus Adolphus.  Strasbourg is one of those European places that has, in its long existence, fought free of close big-power identity. Its people tend to refer to themselves, if pressed for a regional label, as \"Rhenish,\" as though they inhabited islands in the river stream, making there a habitation, an atmosphere, a life all their own.  Hurrying back along the Ill (actually the Rhine is a couple of miles away and you don\\'t see it from the city), down the quais studded here and there with still-golden poplar shimmering along the tiled eaves of the old quarter of the city known as Petty France, I came to where the street burst out into the sprawling pattern of the station square. I had half an hour before the train left for Basel up the Rhine and Lucerne. Then, threading the alpine valleys to the St. Gotthard, it would pick up speed below the high sunset for the long run downhill in the dusk to Lugano, and to my hard-won hotel room in Milan.  --- Mr. King is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York.

Even Coach Ronnie Arrow adheres to the hoary view that college athletes should get an education. \"If Coach sees you in the cafeteria when it\\'s time to go to class, he\\'ll dump your breakfast in the trash,\" says Eddie Cumbo, a freshman from inner-city Houston.  Rival fans taunt San Jacinto as \"Failure U.\" and make a special chant of team members\\' performance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test:  \"S-A-T, S-A-T, You can\\'t pass it, You can\\'t pass it.\"  But the jeers fade when the Ravens take the court. For while creating a remedial program for the basketball stars of tomorrow, San Jacinto has also created the winningest team in college basketball.  San Jacinto\\'s victory streak of 70 games is the longest of any collegiate basketball team today. This season, the Ravens have outscored their opponents by an average of more than 25 points a game. After winning the national junior-college championship three of the past four years, San Jac is favored to take another crown in National Junior College Athletic Association tournament play beginning today in Hutchinson, Kan. And, as in most seasons, major-college recruiters are swarming all over the team.  The Ravens are so good on the court that several neighboring junior colleges once boycotted them for an entire season, forcing the school to fill out its schedule by playing two other teams over and over. \"The biggest negative playing San Jacinto is getting your kids up for the next game,\" says Waldo Dalchau, the coach of rival Blinn College of Brenham, Texas, which lost to San Jac three times this season alone.  But lest the players at San Jac let success go to their heads, they are continually reminded that this isn\\'t the big-time ball they once dreamed of playing. There are no plush athletic dorms at San Jacinto -- only a modest bunkhouse near the gym. Instead of performing in giant field houses, the Ravens play in small, out-of-the-way gyms that seem barely large enough to contain their soaring leaps toward the basket. Instead of flying to road games, they take a stall-prone school bus. And Coach Arrow drives.  \"Not a single one of them would rather be here than at some four-year school,\" says Mr. Arrow, cranking up the bus\\'s overworked starter on the way to a game at Blinn. For most of the players, he says, \"it\\'s probably the first time in their lives that their hands have been spanked and they have been told, \\'No, you can\\'t do that.\\'\"  Their poor grades or test scores result from schoolboy careers as high-school royalty. In most cases their on-court magic exempted them from such severe scholastic rigors as attending class and doing homework. For many such players, who realize too late that they have been cheated out of an education, high school is the end of the line. Says Coach Arrow: \"The parks down in Houston are filled with kids who could play in the pros, but they just never made it through the system.\"  But a high-school degree is enough to get you into a junior-college basketball program. And as major colleges gradually improve academic standards in an effort to \"clean up\" college athletics, they have transformed junior colleges into a farm system with the thankless task of coaxing academic underachievers through their critical freshman and sophomore years.  No one expects the junior colleges to turn out tall Einsteins. In fact, critics worry that junior colleges enable ballplayers to fatten up their marks so that they can coast through their upper-class years at a big school and still remain eligible to play. But the academic program at San Jacinto, at least, is anything but a free throw.  \"We probably work harder getting these guys into the classroom than we do telling them what to do on the court,\" Mr. Arrow says. Teachers are encouraged to report players who skip class or miss assignments. Study-hall attendance is mandatory. Absences are punished by predawn runs. More serious infractions result in reduced playing time or exhausting wind sprints.  \"I wish I could get all my students to attend classes the way the basketball players do,\" says Betty Bastankhah, a literature instructor at San Jacinto. \"I don\\'t think I could make any claims to vast transformation,\" she adds, \"but some of the players work hard and have been good, strong C students.\" Although a few players fail even here, most survive, and almost all who do survive go on to a four-year college.  Those who make it at San Jacinto find the rewards worth the effort. Walter Berry, for instance, was declared ineligible to accept a scholarship at New York\\'s St. John\\'s University and was banished to San Jacinto. After improving his academic credentials here, he finally enrolled at St. John\\'s, where he was recognized as the major-college player of the year. And recently, Mr. Berry signed a professional contract with the San Antonio Spurs.  \"Coach Arrow does a great job putting you together as a person,\" says Mr. Berry. \"Going from San Jac to St. John\\'s was a piece of cake.\"  Some players grudgingly acknowledge that San Jac may be the only thing standing between them and the streets. Moses Scurry of New York, for instance, was recruited as a high-school senior by St. John\\'s a year ago but failed to pass enough summer-school classes to qualify for his scholarship. Sentenced to two years at San Jacinto, he sulked about his fate and played poorly last fall, averaging fewer than five points a game.  At Christmas, however, Mr. Scurry returned to New York and saw that his friends had drifted onto the streets and given up all hope of pursuing sports careers or educations. \"I got friends out on the street who are selling {drugs}, and the money looks good to them,\" says Mr. Scurry. \"They\\'ll never go back to school.\"  He returned to Pasadena with a vengeance, vowing to win a starting role on the court. Since Christmas, he has led the team in scoring and rebounding, and he swears he will earn his junior-college degree. \"I screwed up, and I was going crazy a little,\" Mr. Scurry says. \"Right now, I\\'m back on the right track.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0102': 'How the FBI, Tipped By a Russian, Tracked An Intelligence Leak --- Agency Found an Old Tape Of Ron Pelton\\'s First Call To Soviets 7 Years Ago --- A Missed Summons to Vienna --- By William M. Carley Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> It began with a phone call seven years ago to Vladimir Sorokin, an aide at the Soviet embassy in Washington.  Caller: Vladimir, yes, ah, I have something I would like to discuss with you I think that would be very interesting to you.  Sorokin: Maybe you can, ah, name yourself?  Caller: Uh, on the telephone it would not be wise. . . . I come from . . . I . . . I . . . I am in . . . with the U.S. government.  Sorokin: Uh-huh, U.S. government. . . . Maybe you can visit?  The next day the caller walked into the Soviet embassy. One of his first acts, according to evidence later presented in federal court in Baltimore, was to begin telling the Russians how the U.S. was tapping into a Soviet military communications cable under the sea.  So began an intelligence hemorrhage that was to continue for five years. Before it was stanched, some of the U.S. government\\'s most precious secrets had leaked out, causing what one U.S. official terms \"incalculable damage.\"  The caller was Ronald Pelton, a veteran of 14 years at the National Security Agency, the highly secret government unit that gathers intelligence around the world by eavesdropping on telephone, computer and other communications links. Finally arrested in late 1985, Mr. Pelton now is appealing a conviction for espionage, for which he has been sentenced to life in prison.  In the past three years there have been 26 espionage convictions in the U.S., more than in any comparable period since World War II. Other major incidents, such as the case of the Walker brothers and the swap of journalist Nicholas Daniloff for a Russian accused of spying at the U.N., have in some ways overshadowed the Pelton story.  But that story, new details of which now are available, provides an unusual peek into the shadow world of Soviet and American intelligence. The story involves clandestine meetings in Vienna, chitchat at KGB headquarters in Moscow, and wiretaps and disguises in Washington. Entwined with it is the strange case of Vitaly Yurchenko, the KGB officer who defected to the U.S. and then abruptly returned to Russia.  The beginnings of Mr. Pelton\\'s career were ordinary enough, court records show. Born and reared in Benton Harbor, Mich., the redheaded youth got out of high school in 1960 and joined the Air Force, which sent him to Indiana University for Russian-language courses. He got straight A\\'s. Then he was sent to Pakistan, apparently to monitor Soviet air-force communications. A year after his discharge in 1964, Mr. Pelton went to work as a research technician at the NSA\\'s sprawling headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., north of Washington.  The organization Mr. Pelton joined has a singular purpose. The NSA uses listening posts around the globe and banks of computers at Fort Meade to gather and analyze data to help the U.S. avert -- or fight -- a war. As an example, it might seek to listen in on a Soviet computer link transmitting data on the performance of a new Russian fighter plane.  As the years passed, Mr. Pelton moved up in the NSA\\'s bureaucracy. He became a staff officer, working on budgeting for new projects and acquiring equipment to intercept communications. He fought so effectively for his budgets that he became known as a \"wheeler-dealer,\" in the phrase of one co-worker.  By the late 1970s Mr. Pelton knew his job so well that others would ask his advice. He wrote an internal paper on the 57 Soviet signals the U.S. focused on intercepting, outlining technical details for each, such as frequency and type of modulation. He also knew the sites from which the U.S. intercepted Soviet signals and how it brought them back to the NSA.  In 1979, however, Mr. Pelton\\'s life began going awry. Married with four children but earning a modest $24,500 a year at the NSA, he was attempting to build a home when construction materials were stolen from the site. He soon declared bankruptcy and resigned from the intelligence agency. It was a few months later -- on Jan. 14, 1980 -- that he telephoned the Soviets.  Mr. Pelton wasn\\'t able to visit the embassy that first day. By the next day, the FBI, which routinely taps and records Soviet-embassy phone conversations, had flooded the area around the building with agents in cars and on foot. At 2:30 p.m. the second day, Mr. Pelton phoned again. This time he got Mr. Yurchenko, the KGB officer who was eventually to defect. Mr. Yurchenko suggested a visit.  Pelton: OK, um, how? . . . Do I just ring the bell and someone lets me in? How do I get in?  Yurchenko: No, no, you\\'ll enter through the gate directly.  Pelton: And, OK, they\\'ll let me in?  Yurchenko: Of course, no question.  A few minutes later a burly, bearded man, bundled up against the winter chill, walked down the street three blocks from the White House and through the embassy gate. Frustrated FBI agents saw him mainly from behind and couldn\\'t identify him.  Inside the embassy confusion reigned, according to Mr. Yurchenko, who described the events to U.S. officials in 1985. Mr. Pelton was nervous, sweating profusely, and needed several minutes to calm down enough to talk.  At that point a Soviet electronics technician rushed into the room. He had picked up a burst of radio activity from FBI walkie-talkies and car radios as Mr. Pelton entered the embassy. The radio messages were scrambled, but the technician figured they had been triggered by Mr. Pelton\\'s entry.  The Russians weren\\'t quite sure what to do. The FBI, to keep them off balance, occasionally uses the \"dangle\" technique, in which a U.S. operative offers, or dangles, bogus information. But Mr. Pelton showed a certificate indicating he had graduated from a special NSA course. He also began telling a most intriguing story.  Some years before, Soviet military forces had laid an underwater communications cable in the Sea of Okhotsk, which lies between the Soviet east coast and the Kamchatka peninsula near Japan. The U.S., Mr. Pelton said, had been able to tap the cable, apparently by using submarines, and was listening to Soviet military communications. Using a map, Mr. Pelton pointed out the area of the tap. The project was code-named Ivy Bells.  The Russians were shocked. Mr. Pelton promised to tell more, if paid in \"gold bullion.\" There was more confusion; Mr. Yurchenko, unfamiliar with the English term, at first thought Mr. Pelton was referring to chicken soup.  The first thing to do, the Russians decided, was to get Mr. Pelton out of the embassy undetected. They had the American shave his beard, dress in Soviet work clothes and leave by a side door surrounded by several Russian workers.  The men jumped into a van and drove off to the Soviet workers\\' Washington residence. Watching FBI agents dutifully noted the van\\'s departure from the embassy, unaware the American was inside.  \"We saw him go in, saw his backside, and we could not identify his exit,\" William Webster, the FBI director, said later.  FBI agents were not to spot Mr. Pelton for another five years.  Mr. Yurchenko was never to see Mr. Pelton again. The Russian was working in counterintelligence -- preventing U.S. spies from infiltrating the Soviet system -- so the Pelton case was out of his sphere. Mr. Yurchenko later was reassigned to Moscow, in the prestigious post of deputy chief of the KGB unit overseeing espionage in North America.  After Mr. Pelton\\'s visit, the Soviets relayed his information to Moscow. Soviet military forces found the tap on the undersea cable and removed it. Now the Russians knew they had an invaluable spy.  Mr. Pelton was given a code name, \"Mr. Long.\" To make contact, he was told to drive to a pizza shop in Seven Corners, Va., on the last Saturday of each month and wait for an 8 p.m. call at a pay phone. He followed this procedure, and during one call was told, \"We have something for you.\"  By prior arrangement, those words meant the Russians wanted him to go to Vienna. Mr. Pelton was directed to a second pay phone, beneath which he found a magnetic key-container stuffed with $2,000 to finance the trip.  In October 1980, Mr. Pelton flew to Vienna. As instructed, he strolled through the gardens of the Schonbrunn Palace, the former home of Austria\\'s emperors. A Russian driver picked him up and took him to the Soviet embassy, where Mr. Pelton met KGB agent Anatoly Slavnov from Moscow.  According to later FBI testimony, Mr. Pelton spent \"eight hours a day . . . for three or four days\" with Mr. Slavnov in the Vienna embassy. The KGB agent would present written questions; the American would write answers.  Mr. Pelton knew a lot. Of the thousands of Soviet communications links, he had details of the 57 on which the NSA was concentrating its interception efforts. And he knew how the agency was upgrading its equipment to speed processing of the Soviet messages. The former NSA official, according to the FBI testimony, told the Russians \"everything\" he knew.  In January 1983, Mr. Pelton returned to Vienna. Again, Mr. Slavnov picked his brain.  Back in Moscow, Mr. Slavnov would run into Mr. Yurchenko in the corridors of KGB headquarters. How was \"Mr. Long\" doing? Mr. Yurchenko would ask, and Mr. Slavnov would bring him up to date.  Mr. Pelton\\'s world, meanwhile, was unraveling. He had drifted from job to job since quitting the NSA. By 1985 he had left his family, moved in with a woman friend and begun using cocaine and Dilaudid, a prescription opiate.  He finally took a job as a yacht salesman at Safford Marine in Annapolis, Md. His freedom, however, would be short-lived.  In April 1985 Mr. Pelton flew to Vienna again, but he couldn\\'t find the Soviet driver. He had lost a lot of weight, and he surmised later that the driver didn\\'t recognize him. He flew back to the U.S. After his return, the Soviets called him, demanding that he pick up travel money at the pay phone again and, in October, go back to Vienna.  But on Aug. 1 Mr. Yurchenko, while visiting Rome, walked into the American embassy and defected. He was flown to the U.S. and, on a bucolic Virginia estate outside Washington, was questioned by CIA agents.  Mr. Yurchenko began telling about the \"Mr. Long\" -- he had forgotten Mr. Pelton\\'s real name -- who was handing over NSA secrets to the Russians. Stunned, U.S. officials set up a task force including the NSA and the FBI. The hunt for the spy was on.  \"We began poring over NSA files, looking for possibles,\" says the FBI\\'s Mr. Webster, now the nominee to head the CIA.  Unfortunately, Mr. Yurchenko was fuzzy on some details. He described Mr. Pelton as having red hair, but then pointed to mahogany furniture. In running a computer check of physical descriptions of NSA workers, the U.S. investigators felt they could eliminate only men who were bald or gray. The computer spat out nearly 900 names.  But bit by bit, the KGB man began providing accurate details, some gleaned from his chats with Mr. Slavnov in KGB corridors. \"Mr. Long,\" the Soviet official said, had been married, had driven a green car, had worked on budgets and had had access to the Ivy Bells undersea tap project. U.S. investigators narrowed their list to about 100 NSA names.  Then Mr. Yurchenko told of Mr. Pelton\\'s calls to the Soviet embassy in Washington. He couldn\\'t remember the year -- he thought it was 1978 or 1979 -- but he remembered that when the American walked in, the Russians had detected the FBI\\'s increased radio activity.  By checking periods of stepped-up surveillance of the embassy, FBI agents came up with January 1980. In the FBI library of tape recordings for that period, they found the Pelton calls.  Then began the process of trying to match the recorded voice to one of the 100 suspects. Investigators decided to play the tapes to NSA workers in the hope that one of them would recognize the voice. But the process would be tricky because the suspect could have returned to the NSA. \"What if the tapes were inadvertently played to Pelton himself?\" one U.S. official asks. So investigators chose only the most trustworthy NSA workers.  At last, on Oct. 15, 1985, one listener said, \"That\\'s Ron Pelton.\"  Within days, the FBI had tapped Mr. Pelton\\'s phone at Safford Marine and his woman friend\\'s phone. The FBI also placed listening devices in her apartment and in Mr. Pelton\\'s car. And the agency began trailing Mr. Pelton round-the-clock.  Mr. Pelton was supposed to be in Vienna about this time. There, the Soviets might have warned him about the Yurchenko defection and arranged his escape. But chance intervened. While driving to the pizza shop at the end of September 1985 to get the Soviets\\' phone call, Mr. Pelton ran out of gas. He missed the call, and so never made the October trip.  By early November pressure on the FBI was intensifying. Mr. Yurchenko had astonished everyone by defecting back to the Soviets and, in a widely publicized Washington press conference, had castigated the CIA. Investigators worried that Mr. Pelton might guess that the Soviet had fingered him.  The phone taps and listening devices, however, hadn\\'t yielded incriminating evidence. So the FBI took a gamble. On a Sunday morning, Nov. 24, FBI agent David Faulkner phoned Mr. Pelton at Safford Marine and asked him to come to the nearby Annapolis Hilton to discuss an urgent matter. In that interview and in another that evening, Mr. Faulkner and FBI agent Dudley Hodgson extracted enough information from Mr. Pelton to convict him. At 10 minutes before midnight, the agents arrested him.  At Mr. Pelton\\'s trial, the chief of the NSA group that intercepts and studies Soviet communications, William Crowell, described American losses. The undersea tap, he said, \"gave us an insight into {Soviet} military forces, the relative sizes, {and} their plans for maneuvers. . . .\" The NSA was getting Soviet military orders at the same time Russian commanders were.  Even more damaging, perhaps, was material on the 57 key Soviet communication channels that the NSA was concentrating on intercepting. Tipped to the NSA efforts, the Soviets had a better chance of blocking them. One of those channels, according to Donald Bacon, another NSA official, was \"from the highest levels of the Soviet down to their next-level echelon.\"  And what did the Soviets have to pay \"Mr. Long\" for this priceless information? Besides travel expenses to Vienna, Mr. Pelton says, they gave him just $35,000. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0098': 'As U.S. Becomes \\'Mature\\' Oil Province --- By James Tanner Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) NATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) </IN> Exxon Corp., the leading U.S. petroleum producer, is bullish on domestic natural gas but pessimistic on the oil prospects.  As a result, it is targeting a growing proportion of its oil expenditures abroad, though total capital and exploration spending has been sharply reduced since 1985.  Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, describes the U.S. as a \"mature\" oil province. \"The industry in this country is about 125 years old, and that\\'s a long time in one geological setting with all the wells we have drilled,\" he says, noting that today\\'s unexplored areas are largely outside the U.S.  His views are shared by many other American oil executives who have been directing much of their companies\\' search for petroleum outside the heavily drilled U.S. since last year\\'s oil-price collapse. But Exxon\\'s moves, monitored closely by others in the industry because of the company\\'s size, can have a bigger impact than those of other oil concerns.  A year ago, after oil prices plunged, Exxon began reducing capital and exploration spending. In 1986, such expenditures totaled $7.2 billion, down from nearly $10.8 billion in 1985. Foreign spending related to energy was cut less than domestic spending, however. Energy-related foreign expenditures fell $1 billion, to $3.9 billion, in 1986. Domestic energy-related expenditures dropped $2.5 billion, to $2.8 billion. For this year, world-wide capital and exploration expenditures are budgeted at $6.5 billion.  Exxon\\'s biggest cuts have been in U.S. exploration and production operations. The drop in domestic drilling by Exxon, formerly the premier U.S. wildcatter, is indicative of the changes. At year-end 1985, Exxon was participating in the drilling of 453 oil and gas wells world-wide, including 323 in the U.S. At year-end 1986, it is understood that the number of wells being drilled in which Exxon participated was down 52% world-wide and 63% in the U.S.  \"We\\'re a high-cost country now, not only in terms of (oil) production costs but also exploration costs,\" says Mr. Rawl. He says he doubts that there are any more giant oil fields to be found in the U.S. -- certainly none the size of Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered in 1968 by Exxon and Atlantic Richfield Co. on Alaska\\'s North Slope. \"Not only Exxon and the industry but the politicians and the planners and everybody else ought to recognize where we are in the life cycle\" of the U.S. as an oil province, Mr. Rawl says.  But Exxon \"will continue to do our fair share of the exploration in this country,\" the Exxon chief says. \"And,\" Mr. Rawl adds, \"I see a lot more potential in the U.S. for natural gas.\"  Natural gas currently accounts for about one-half of Exxon\\'s proved oil and gas reserves of 15.1 billion barrels, as measured in the oil equivalent. But because of the company\\'s vast natural gas holdings both at home and abroad, Lee R. Raymond, president, says Exxon should become more of a gas than an oil company in the years ahead.  Similarly, he says, Exxon will become more of a coal company because of its large coal resources. Eventually, synthetic fuels including shale oil will also emerge as a factor in the company\\'s energy mix. Meantime, Mr. Raymond says, \"We are probably going to become more of an international company.\"  Exxon, of course, has been international for many decades. One of the Seven Sisters -- as the biggest international oil companies were known -- it was aggressively exploring for petroleum abroad even in the 1950s and 1960s, when U.S. oil producers seemed to be drowning in a sea of domestic oil. Today, Exxon\\'s units or affiliates are leading oil operators in Canada, Europe, the North Sea, Australia, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries.  In the U.S., Exxon produces about 800,000 barrels a day of liquid hydrocarbons. World-wide it produces 1.8 million barrels a day, refines three million barrels a day and markets, as petroleum products, four million barrels a day. Its world-wide output of natural gas exceeds five billion cubic feet a day.  Other companies also have reduced spending in the U.S., many more sharply than Exxon. But, according to Petroleum Information Corp., which tracks well results across the U.S., Exxon ranked No. 1 among leading U.S. operators in 1985 by drilling a total of 1,073 oil and gas wells. Last year, according to the Petroleum Information tabulations, Exxon slipped to No. 3 with 558 wells drilled. In wildcat explorations seeking entirely new oil fields, the company reported, Exxon fell from No. 1 in 1985 with 118 wells drilled to No. 2 in 1986 with only 52 wildcat wells.  For example, along with other oil concerns, Exxon had been spending heavily searching for oil in the Bering Basin and the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska. By 1986, Mr. Rawl says, it was apparent after 33 straight dry holes \"that the source rock wasn\\'t very attractive.\" Exxon drilled 11 of the dry holes at a cost of more than $1 billion.  Mr. Rawl says Exxon continues to hold its leases in many areas, even though the resources may be non-commercial at today\\'s oil prices. A \"significant restructuring of everybody\\'s exploration budgets in 1986\" would have taken place in the U.S. even if the price of oil hadn\\'t plunged, Mr. Rawl adds. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0097': 'Rate Rose to 79.8% During February --- By Rose Gutfeld Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN> The operating rate at the nation\\'s factories, mines and utilities rose to 79.8% of capacity last month, the Federal Reserve Board said, providing evidence of the industrial sector\\'s continued modest improvement.  The increase, which followed revised rates of 79.6% in January and December, marked the fifth consecutive month without a decline. Previously, the Fed put the level at 79.7% in January and 79.5% in December.  The Fed said increases in the operating rate have accelerated since last October, when the rate was 79%. Still, many economists contend that world-wide overcapacity in many industries, among other factors, is likely to restrain output gains in the months ahead.  Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that much of the increased production is likely being used to rebuild inventories, which declined in the fourth quarter. He cautioned that \"we still haven\\'t seen the strength in final demand that would support increases for very long.\"  Last month, the operating rate for factories climbed to 80.1% from 79.9% in January. The Fed said automobile assemblies surged and production of primary metals increased. Mining industries operated at 75.3% in February, up from 75.1% the month before. Utilities operated at 80.8%, up from 80.4%. Producers of industrial materials used 78.9% of capacity, the same as in January. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0096': 'Improved Voice-Directed Products Are Poised to Enter Mass Market --- By Paul Duke Jr. Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> \"Forward!\" I cried, but it was the wrong move. My M-1 tank surged ahead and crashed into the wall of an office building in north Dallas.  Luckily for me and my insurance company the tank was a plastic model about a foot long. And, naturally, I wasn\\'t inside; I controlled it by speaking into a headset microphone attached to a small computer. The computer translated my words (like \"stop\" or \"left\") into electrical signals and sent them through a radio transmitter to the tank about 15 feet away.  The tank is a prototype toy made by Voice Control Systems, a small Dallas-based manufacturer of computers that recognize speech. It\\'s the kind of speech-controlled product that people are likely to see more of as a handful of companies try to push their inventions into everyday use.  On the horizon are cellular telephones that can be dialed by speaking a phone number. There are also home-security systems that respond to cries for help, cars with voice-controlled windshield wipers, lights and radios, as well as aids for the handicapped. The possibilities seem endless for toys that respond to children\\'s spoken words.  The devices are rather primitive by human standards; they will understand only about 100 to 200 words, and nearly all need to be trained to recognize the voice of the primary user. \"We\\'ve still got a few technology hoops to jump through,\" says Lynn Taylor, president of Microphonics Technology Corp. in Auburn, Wash.  Most researchers now believe they have largely conquered the two biggest problems that turned buyers away: abysmal accuracy and difficulty distinguishing speech from background noise. But manufacturers must still convince consumers that they need such products. After all, cars that talked to people -- reminding drivers that lights were on or that doors were open -- proved to be mostly an annoyance. Do people want to talk back?  \"Marketing voice recognition has turned out to be very difficult,\" says William Spain, who follows the voice-technology industry for Probe Research Inc., a research company in Morristown, N.J. \"Talking to appliances seems like a fun idea, but so far no one\\'s been able to make it work.\"  One breakthrough has come in car or cellular telephones that can be dialed by speaking. Because of the possible dangers of dialing while trying to steer a car, many industry executives see this as one of the most obvious applications for voice recognition.  Here\\'s how they work: A typical system might have 20 to 40 names that the owner stores beforehand in the computer\\'s memory by speaking the name and then dialing in the corresponding number. When the user picks up the car phone, a spoken code word like \"dial\" tells the computer it should start listening. Then the user says \"husband\" or \"work\" or the name of a friend -- whatever is stored in the memory. The computer then dials the number.  With some systems, users can also dial numbers that aren\\'t already in the computer\\'s memory by speaking the names of the digits in a normal phone number. Before dialing, the computer\\'s recorded voice speaks the numbers back through the phone receiver, to make sure it understood correctly.  Most systems will understand only one person\\'s voice, though companies are trying to get around this hurdle. Voice Control Systems is working on a product that will respond to anyone\\'s voice. Using an unusual approach -- breaking down spoken words into parts, rather than the usual method of matching electronic pictures of complete words against a catalog of such pictures -- Voice Control says its system will understand any accent, from Maine to Texas.  As companies master such so-called speaker independence, individuals may find themselves having more telephone conversations with computers. This is already beginning to happen overseas, partially because of the scarcity of touch-tone phones. Computers can pick up the tones as numbers, but can\\'t do the same for the clicks of the rotary dial phones more prevalent outside the U.S.  In Buenos Aires, Argentina, for instance, tremendous inflation brought Banco del Buen Ayre a deluge of calls from customers checking on interest and exchange rates. Votan, a voice-recognition company in Fremont, Calif., designed a sound-recognition computer system for the bank that handles as many as 20,000 calls a day and allows customers to tranfer funds and get balance information as well as learn interest and exchange rates.  \"It helps that the words for numbers in Spanish are longer than in English,\" says Bruce Ryon, Votan\\'s director of marketing communications. (The longer the word, the more clues the computer has to recognize it.)  Many companies are looking into aids for the handicapped. The Voice Connection in Irvine, Calif., makes a wheelchair controlled by voice commands. Because the commands must be sent by radio signals through a nearby personal computer, however, the set-up isn\\'t practical outside a house or office.  Other products will include fancier versions of the computer-software \"controllers\" made by many companies. These allow people to operate some functions of word-processing or spreadsheet programs, for instance, with voice commands. Microphonics Technology says it is developing a combination voice-recognizer, voice-synthesizer that would allow a person to call a personal computer over phone lines and have it read back text in a computer file. The device will cost about $600 and should be out this spring.  Another likely application is cars. For Renault, the French car maker, Votan put together a system that allows voice control of the windshield wipers, radio, heater, air conditioner and windows. It operated in a prototype car shown at a Paris auto show in October.  Not everyone sees the charm in such gadgets. \"It has snob appeal, but I don\\'t see any great practical advantages,\" says Bob Bargert, publisher of Alarm Installer and Dealer, a magazine that also sponsors home-security trade shows. But others say the masses are ready for voice recognition -- after a bit of fine tuning.  Intellisys Corp., for example, a Dallas research company, built a super-automated house incorporating a Votan system that controlled lights and appliances. \"At first we put microphone units in the walls, but people hated it,\" says Don Bynum, the company\\'s president. \"They felt silly talking to the wall. Once we set it up through the phone they loved it.\"  Most people in the industry agree that toys that recognize speech will likely be a hit. A doll named Julie, made by Worlds of Wonder Inc. in Fremont, Calif., made a stir at the New York Toy Fair last month. It recognizes about 25 words and responds with about 100 phrases. It is expected to be priced at about $100 and be available in late summer, the company says.  \"Toys, oh boy, are we going to make toys,\" says Peter Foster, president of Voice Control Systems. \"At the moment we\\'ve got to get some serious products out, but\" -- he points to skid marks on the office carpet left by researchers testing a voice-steered wheelchair a bit over-zealously -- \"you can see these guys really want to have fun.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0095': '</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND) </IN> Traders wanting to know what might affect stock prices have started watching an unlikely source: New Jersey\\'s state pension plan.  The New Jersey fund is trying to divest itself of stocks with South Africa business connections -- and that\\'s causing stock market ripples. Several times in the past six months, news of a New Jersey \"sell program\" has swept the market, prompting other traders to sell as well, rather than fight the tide.  Yesterday, for example, the New Jersey fund told brokers at 8:30 a.m. EST that it wanted to sell $57 million of South Africa-linked stocks. This quickly depressed stock-index futures when they started trading at 9:15 a.m. The weakness then spread to stocks, once they began trading at 9:30 a.m. For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 10.22 points at 2248.44.  \"We\\'re only a speck on the horizon,\" insists Roland Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment. Although his $17 billion fund has been divesting itself of more than $3 billion of South Africa-related stocks and bonds, it does so periodically in fairly small chunks, he says. Yesterday\\'s order amounted to just 25 stocks, in blocks of no more than 100,000 shares, he adds. \"That\\'s a tiny part of the day\\'s volume,\" says Mr. Machold.  But traders say New Jersey\\'s impact may be magnified by its practice of seeking competitive bids from as many as nine securities firms. \"It doesn\\'t make sense,\" says a trader at a large Wall Street firm. \"They could get it done by just seeking two or three bids, and they wouldn\\'t have as many people knowing about it beforehand.\"  Mr. Machold replies that competitive bids help New Jersey get the best terms for its sales. Yesterday, for example, the state agreed to accept an average sales price of nine cents a share below Friday\\'s closing prices. But that turned out to be more than 20 cents a share above average opening prices, because stocks fell so much at the start of trading. \"You could argue that we actually made money,\" Mr. Machold says.  New Jersey plans to reinvest yesterday\\'s proceeds in the securities markets, so in principle its trading shouldn\\'t have a lasting effect. But traders say the sales of South Africa-related stocks are conspicuous enough to often have more market impact than subsequent, gradual purchases of South Africa-free companies.  \"They\\'ve been very effective with their competitive bidding,\" says Sam Hunter, head of equity trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Hunter declined to comment on market rumors that his firm had handled yesterday\\'s trades. Officials at Morgan Stanley, another rumored agent for the sales, also declined comment.  Mr. Machold says New Jersey chose to step up its latest round of South Africa divesting because of concern that the stock market might be unsettled later this week. Many stock options and futures contracts expire Friday; their simultaneous expiration is known as the triple witching hour, and has sometimes been a source of market turbulence.  Selling off stocks of companies doing business in South Africa -- which include some of the largest U.S. oil, drug and computer companies -- \"obviously reduces your investment flexibility,\" says Mr. Machold. \"But it\\'s very difficult to quantify.\"  In any case, New Jersey has plenty more South Africa-related selling to do. Roughly $1 billion of stocks and bonds will need to be sold by a state legislature-imposed deadline of Aug. 31, 1988, Mr. Machold says. It\\'s possible that an additional $5 billion of securities could be affected, depending on how state officials decide to treat companies with only very minor or indirect business interests in South Africa, he added. And several other large states, notably California, are preparing to require South Africa-free portfolios as well. ',\n",

Alper</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN> Any discussion of disability is complicated by whether the disability is partial or total, temporary or permanent, and by whether one is speaking of worker\\'s compensation, private insurance, state disability or Social Security disability. (The last has the most stringent requirements and will not pay unless the patient is incapable of any gainful work.)  --The National Center for Health Statistics of the U.S. Public Health Service says that in 1983, short-term disability days nationwide caused an annual average of 14.5 days of restricted activity per person employed. (A restricted activity day is one in which a person cuts down on his usual activities for more than half of that day because of illness or an injury.) That year, among employed people aged 18 to 64, the average number of lost work days was 4.2.  --According to the Social Security Administration, in 1984 a total of $19.5 billion of benefits was paid under workers\\' compensation. This is somewhat less than the $24.6 billion combined amount received by disabled workers and their dependents under the Social Security Disability Insurance Program and Medicare.  --The National Council on Compensation Insurance, which sets workers\\' compensation rates in 32 states and advises in others, says stress accounts for nearly 14% of occupational disease claims, up from less than 5% eight years ago.  --California has some of the most liberal grounds for granting workers\\' compensation disability claims, and stress and harassment are the \"in\" complaints. A group of psychologists apparently linked to a group of lawyers advertises in newspapers for such business. The California Department of Industrial Relations reports that disabling work injuries and illnesses in 1985 totaled 400,157.  --The Health Insurance Association of America, the association of private insurers, states that 82.2 million Americans had some kind of private disability coverage in 1984. Of that total, 59.3 million had a policy that pays for up to two years; 22.9 million had long-term coverage (anywhere from over two years to lifetime; usually five years or more).  --Doctor\\'s records can be expected to be subpoenaed when there is a question of permanent disability. They may also be examined if people don\\'t return to work when ordinarily expected, when the case looks doubtful to the claims examiner or if there is a need to search for pre-existing conditions. It might depend on what the employer says and how real the case looks. One examiner calls it \"a chess game -- a process of bargaining.\" A few doctors are known to give time off at the drop of a hat. Their names get out, sometimes at the recommendation of labor attorneys, according to a claims examiner I know. I have never heard of a doctor being disciplined for exaggerating a disability claim.

       " 'WSJ870317-0092': 'A Low-Cost Version Of Popular Painkiller</HL> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN> The U.S. unit of Hoechst AG said it expects to begin producing within a year a low-cost version of the popular non-aspirin painkiller, acetaminophen.  At a news conference here, officials of Hoechst Celanese Corp. said new chemical production processes under development are expected to reduce the painkiller\\'s price \"substantially.\"  \"I think a 20% to 40% reduction (in the compound\\'s cost) wouldn\\'t be unreasonable,\" said James Bigham, a vice president of the Somerville, N.J.-based drug and chemical company.  Hoechst Celanese is the U.S. unit of West Germany-based Hoechst. The company is the result of Hoechst\\'s recent $2.84 billion purchase of Celanese Corp.  U.S. sales of non-aspirin painkillers exceed $500 million annually.  Mr. Bigham said the new technique requires fewer processing steps, thus reducing raw-material and energy costs. He said the technique is also applicable to other compounds that are widely used as chemical building blocks by drug producers.  Production of the lower-cost acetaminophen is scheduled for a facility under construction in Bishop, Texas. The plant\\'s eventual capacity will be 20 million pounds annually, or about one-third of current world demand for the compound, which is the major generic non-aspirin painkiller.  Ernest Drew, the company\\'s president, said Hoechst Celanese anticipates spending $150 million in 1987 for three major research projects. Besides the acetaminophen plant, the other projects involve development of super-absorbent fibers for disposable diapers and expansion of a company acrylic acid facility in Clear Lake, Texas.  Hoechst Celanese officials also said they are exploring ways of refinancing some $600 million in debt stemming from the Celanese purchase.  The company hasn\\'t yet decided which polyester fibers plants it will sell to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission\\'s approval of the merger, Hoechst Celanese officials said.  The combined U.S. companies had 1986 sales of $4.6 billion. Hoechst, the parent, had world-wide 1986 sales of $17 billion.  A spokesman for Monsanto Co.\\'s chemical business said the company believes Monsanto\\'s process for making acetaminophen is \"cost-competitive.\" Monsanto also produces aspirin.  He also said Monsanto was surprised to learn that Hoechst is going ahead with them at a time when the acetaminophen market is flat, if not in a decline, because of the advent of ibuprofen, another non-aspirin pain reliever.  Ibuprofen\\'s growth at acetaminophen\\'s expense means that present production capacity for the older analgesic, as well as capacity expansion under way before the Hoechst announcement, is enough to meet demand, the Monsanto spokesman said.

       " 'WSJ870317-0091': 'PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN> In an episode of the 1950s TV series \"The Honeymooners,\" Ralph Cramden bet big money on a product he called \"Cramden\\'s Miracle Hair Restorer.\" The idea then seemed steeped in quackery and snake oil. But maybe Ralph was just 30 years ahead of his time.  Today, treatments for baldness -- despite persisting questions about their effectiveness -- are fast gaining a semblance of legitimacy, and cosmetics companies are rushing to exploit the change. At least half-a-dozen tonics for thinning hair are being introduced this year. With some 35 million American men and 20 million women losing their hair, the market for hair restorers could swell from practically nothing to between $2 billion and $4 billion a year, industry analysts say, about the size of the market for soaps and deodorants.  The move toward respectability is based largely on the hair-growing potential of Upjohn Co.\\'s minoxidil, a drug that was originally licensed to treat hypertension. Yesterday, an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of minoxidil as a prescription drug to treat hair loss.  \"Minoxidil is making people more tolerant of hearing that there is possibly something to promote hair growth,\" says Alan Kling, a New York dermatologist who offers minoxidil treatments. \"It gives them hope, and companies are capitalizing on that.\"  The foundation for this hope is still a bit shaky. Though certainly better than snake oil, minoxidil is no miracle cure. Research dermatologists say only one-third of patients using a minoxidil-based lotion twice daily will see some hair growth, after four to six months of treatment. And the treatment must continue forever, or any gains simply vanish.  Still, Dr. Kling says, \"any increase at all is treated as a windfall\" by a man or woman yearning for a full head of hair. That wisdom isn\\'t lost on the cosmetics industry, once described by Revlon founder Charles Revson as \"hope in a bottle.\"  \"Women have an understanding that you can\\'t make wrinkles disappear, but there is always the hope,\" says Suzanne Kennedy Flynn, who has written about baldness. Cosmetics firms, she says, \"are tapping into that same attitude in men concerning baldness. It\\'s a market that pushes the emotional buttons of men.\"  Trading on the attention drawn by minoxidil, cosmetics companies are taking a quasi-scientific approach to marketing their new hair tonics. By carefully avoiding any promises that their products can grow hair, and by using ingredients that don\\'t require government review, the industry has avoided having its products considered drugs, which need lengthy and costly tests to earn FDA approval.  The marketing pitches clearly aim at anyone with a hair problem. An ad for Nutriplexx, a product introduced in January by Estee Lauder-owned Aramis, reads: \"At last there is something you can do about your thinning hair. Something more constructive than watching helplessly day by day as your hair becomes even thinner, sparser, less vital.\"  The products are often packaged like medicine. Nutriplexx comes in bottles with eyedroppers; Foltene, which was introduced three weeks ago by Minnetonka Inc. in Chaska, Minn., comes in a packet of 10 vials. The ads for each refer to research that led to the discovery of the products\\' most active ingredients. The Foltene ad even has a diagram showing the chemical composition of tricosaccaride, a sugar used in its formula.  Yet the cosmetics firms are also trying to win points for not being drugs. They emphasize \"natural\" ingredients and play up their harmlessness. Minnetonka, which licensed Foltene from Crinos ESP. in Italy, has a full-page magazine ad saying, \"Europe\\'s answer to thinning hair: Foltene, a prescription-free solution.\"  If they aren\\'t drugs -- but are more than shampoos -- just what are the new products? Do they offer more than hope?  Dermatologists say treatment with any good shampoo is likely to be just as beneficial as the new tonics. \"The fact is that if you take normal hair, shampoo it, and massage it regularly, some will grow,\" says Ronald Savin, a Yale University professor of dermatology.  The key word, however, is \"some.\" The new hair, says Dr. Savin, will be \"vellus,\" a fine, colorless fuzz that looks like baby hair. As for the implicit promise of the cosmetics products, he says: \"The cosmetics industry has the license to say anything because it\\'s not in the realm of drugs. It\\'s in the realm of romance.\"  The manufacturers themselves say there is no guarantee that their products will grow hair. Rather, they emphasize how the tonics are better than shampoos and conditioners. Jack Wiswall, president of Aramis, says Nutriplexx, unlike shampoos, reaches the hair beneath the surface, supplying it with nutrients and therefore \"energizing\" it. He calls it \"a serious scalp treatment.\"  The vagueness of the promises, however, may not lessen the appeal of the new tonics, drug-industry analysts and dermatologists say. When Shiseido Co. in Japan first introduced a hair product called Flowlin in 1982, net sales were $7 million. Each year since, sales have reached at least $30 million, the company says. (Flowlin -- which in Japanese means \"never-aging forest,\" and which the company describes as a \"revitalizing hair tonic\" -- has been available in the U.S. for about a year, but the company won\\'t release sales figures.)  Nancy Hall, a cosmetics industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., expects sales of Minnetonka\\'s Foltene to top $20 million in its first year in the U.S. It has been sold in Europe since 1981.  Some analysts say that once prescription drugs for hair growth become available, they may crowd out the cosmetics companies\\' offerings. \"For the first time,\" says Hemant Shah, an analyst for Nomura Securities International Inc., \"you\\'ll have more than hope and hype.\"  Within the year, minoxidil-based Rogaine will probably be available from Upjohn. American Cyanamid Co. is currently testing Viprostol, a drug that, depending on test results and the FDA, could be on the market by 1990. A small company in Los Angeles, Chantal Pharmaceutical Corp., is testing Cyoctol as a treatment for both acne and male-pattern baldness.  Ms. Hall of Smith Barney, however, suggests that many consumers may buy both prescription drugs and hair tonics -- the drugs to grow hair and the tonics to \"nurture\" the growth. Other consumers will continue to avoid prescription drugs, she says, and will buy the tonics; those who want to experiment will find them cheaper. Minoxidil treatments, including several visits to the dermatologist, can cost about $1,000 a year. By comparison, Ms. Hall estimates, a year\\'s worth of Foltene costs $225. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0089': 'But It Also Is at Issue in His Appeal</HL> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN> When two FBI agents first began questioning Ronald Pelton on Nov. 24, 1985, it was clear their task wasn\\'t going to be easy. \"You have got no case,\" Mr. Pelton said. \"You can\\'t get your witness back, and you have got no documents.\"  He had a point. Vitaly Yurchenko of the KGB, the man who had told the FBI of a spy code-named \"Mr. Long,\" had by this time defected back to the Soviet Union and was in Moscow. And Mr. Pelton hadn\\'t stolen any National Security Agency documents to give the Soviets.  In fact, at that point the FBI didn\\'t even have grounds to arrest Mr. Pelton, much less enough to convict him. But bit by bit, in an example of the bureau\\'s interrogation technique, the agents got enough details from Mr. Pelton to convince a federal jury he was guilty of espionage.  The FBI planned the interview for a Sunday morning at 9. The early hour left plenty of time, and Mr. Pelton would be at work alone, with nobody else around to offer him advice.  At what was to be the interview site, the Annapolis Hilton, the agents rented several rooms. One would serve as headquarters, another held a polygraph machine that could be used (it wasn\\'t) and a third was for the questioning.  The chair where Mr. Pelton was to be seated faced away from the window, so he wouldn\\'t be distracted. To promote friendliness and openness, there were coffee and doughnuts on hand.  Then, in what was Mr. Pelton\\'s first indication that he was a suspect, FBI agent David Faulkner simply phoned and asked him to come to the hotel to discuss an \"urgent matter\"; Mr. Pelton complied. Then Mr. Faulkner and agent Dudley Hodgson sat down with the suspect, and Mr. Faulkner recounted a story about an individual -- clearly Mr. Pelton -- who he said had been reared in Benton Harbor, Mich., worked for the NSA and visited with the Soviets in their embassy. The agents then played the tapes of Mr. Pelton\\'s calls to the embassy. And they showed a photo of Mr. Yurchenko to Mr. Pelton, who, according to later FBI testimony, \"shrank away\" from it. Finally, in a casual way, the agents asked Mr. Pelton to complete the story.  Mr. Pelton denied that the voice on the tape was his. Agent Hodgson said it clearly was, and asked if he would be willing to take a polygraph test on that point \"right now.\" Mr. Pelton gave no answer.  The agents pressed him again, presenting themselves as the \"good guys.\" They said they believed Mr. Pelton might cooperate, a move that would forestall the bureau\\'s sending teams of agents to interview everyone Mr. Pelton knew, including his employer. Their superiors wanted to proceed with broad interviews immediately, they said; only cooperation by Mr. Pelton could stave that off.  \"Whoever . . . was involved in this business would be crazy . . . to make any statements without having an attorney,\" Mr. Pelton responded, according to his own testimony later. He testified that at that point he directly asked for a lawyer. Mr. Faulkner\\'s testimony disputed that account.  Mr. Pelton is appealing his conviction, contending that he didn\\'t make his statements voluntarily and that the FBI agents should have formally advised him, prior to any incriminating statements, of his right to have an attorney and remain silent. The prosecution argued that Mr. Pelton offered bits of information to the interrogators as bargaining chips, trying to win a guarantee against being prosecuted.  Stymied temporarily, the FBI agents shifted the topic. They asked Mr. Pelton sympathetically about his financial troubles, and he poured out his tale of bankruptcy. According to his later testimony, one agent casually asked, \"Without committing yourself, about how much money was involved?\"  Mr. Pelton said he got $35,000 from the Soviets. The agents asked for the dates. When he said payments were made in Vienna, he was asked about the trips there. Mr. Pelton responded with colorful detail, including how he was housed in the residence of the Soviet ambassador to Austria, much to the irritation of the ambassador, who had to vacate the apartment.  In the early afternoon Mr. Pelton had to leave to keep an engagement with his woman friend. But as requested, he returned to the Hilton by 10:40 p.m.  The agents sought to learn what information Mr. Pelton had given the Soviets, as prosecution would require showing potential harm to the U.S. Mr. Pelton balked, saying he wanted \"guarantees\" against prosecution. The agents said that was up to their superiors.  Next, after saying that they knew about the undersea tap, the agents gave Mr. Pelton a map and asked him to circle the area where he had told the Russians the U.S. had tapped in. Mr. Pelton drew a circle. He said he had chosen this project to describe to the Soviets when he first walked into the embassy because they could easily and quickly understand its value.  At this point the FBI agents read Mr. Pelton his legal rights, including his right to an attorney. He also signed a statement saying that \"I do not want a lawyer\" and that \"no promises or threats have been made to me.\"  The discussion became harsher. As Mr. Pelton described it in later testimony, \"The questions were rapid-fire, one question, another question, another question. . . .\"  Mr. Faulkner wanted Mr. Pelton to say whether he believed his disclosures would hurt the U.S., another element necessary to prosecution. Mr. Pelton hesitated but, according to FBI testimony, finally agreed that in general, yes, the disclosures would be harmful.  By 11:50 p.m. it was over. The FBI agents snapped handcuffs on Mr. Pelton and took him to jail.

       " 'WSJ870317-0086': 'A Special News Report on People And Their Jobs in Offices, Fields and Factories --- By Selwyn Feinstein</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN> STOCK OPTIONS GROW as a lure for attracting outside directors.  Though shunned only a few years ago as a potential conflict of interest, stock options are beginning to gain acceptance in director compensation packages, says Korn/Ferry International. Last year, by the recruiter\\'s count, the options were offered by 8.2% of 532 companies studied, up from 3.1% in 1985 and 1.1% in 1984.  CPAs Peat Marwick, in a study of 150 financial companies, finds seven that extend stock options to outside directors. One bank each year awards 100 shares plus a $15,000 retainer. Another hands out 2,000 restricted shares that vest over a 10-year term. But they vest immediately if control of the company changes hands.  \"We expect to see a stronger link between directors\\' compensation and shareholder value,\" Peat says.  COMPARED WITH EUROPEANS, we look like gluttons for work.  American men generally consider 65 an ideal age for retirement, less ambitious than the 70 most often cited by Japanese males. But, say Stanford sociologists Alex Inkeles and Chikako Isui, British and French men would rather turn in their papers when they reach 60. And, in retirement, the Americans and Japanese want to live off their savings, while the Europeans expect to depend more on social-security checks.  \"Social-security provisions influence most people to retire eventually,\" the researchers say. But the divergence in willingness to work \"cannot be explained by differences in the availability or adequacy of pensions in these four countries,\" they contend. Instead, they say, retirement age reflects \"preferences, basic values and conceptions about what is good and proper.\"  SMOKERS BEWARE! You\\'re less likely to get that job.  Kenneth Imber, Atlanta district manager of Syntex Corp., says he smokes a pack of cigarettes a week in social situations. Even so, he says he would most likely hire a nonsmoker over a smoker. Smokers, he complains, are prone to miss work. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. figures a smoker costs the company $625 to $675 more a year.  At Georgia Power Co., where neither the chairman nor the president smoke, smoking is barred in all public areas of corporate headquarters, and \"now there\\'s a real reluctance to light up anywhere,\" says Gordon Van Mol, director of corporate communications. But Westinghouse Electric Corp., though it also tries to discourage smoking, doesn\\'t impose any formal ban.  \"We\\'re not going to make smokers second-class citizens,\" Paul Jones, a Westinghouse spokesman, says.  DRUG-TESTING DEMAND draws only mild protest at Harvard Business School. School officials say five major companies -- Chemical Bank, Chrysler, General Foods, Manufacturers Hanover and Rohm &amp; Haas -- have advised the placement office they\\'ll administer drug tests to any student offered a job. According to a poll, most students don\\'t like it. Only 18%, however, say they\\'ll refuse to go along.  FORGET THE FORMULA that you should be earning your age times $1,000, says the Association of Executive Search Consultants. The trade group declares today\\'s hot-shot executives should be pulling in $62,000 by age 30, $132,000 by 40, and $179,000 on reaching 45.  POOR PLANNING causes transfers to go wrong, says Runzheimer International. The consultant says companies pressed to return relocated employees to their old jobs in their old towns generally blame the failed transfers on families that couldn\\'t adjust or employees who couldn\\'t hack it in new posts. But Runzheimer faults the employers for failing to brief workers on their moves.  FLIGHT OF FANCY: An arbitrator rules that Wardair Canada flight attendant Robert Elder has the right to wear an earring on the job, arguing the airline\\'s restriction \"is a needless and in that sense an unreasonable restriction on his freedom to appear to the world in an image which he has chosen for himself.\" The carrier is appealing.  IF SERVICE STINKS, why don\\'t companies spend more, a training firm asks.  Zenger-Miller Inc. says that, despite the furor over the poor quality of service, American corporations are spending only $2.58 per employee to improve their dealings with the public. And most of that money, says the consultant, goes to train workers to sell more or to calm complaining customers. But a spot check shows companies, though conceding service is a problem, insist they\\'re spending a lot more.  Emery Air Freight says it is launching a service training program that will cost $1,000 a worker. Ryder System is putting all its executives through what it calls \"Quality College.\" US Sprint says, \"We\\'ve done the boot-camp part; next we\\'ll go after the officer training.\" Some companies preach service to back-office workers as well as frontline staff. But they concede they are less aggressive with workers who don\\'t deal with the public.  \"That would get awful expensive,\" explains James Massey, chief executive of Merchant\\'s National Bank.  THE CHECKOFF: Don\\'t be too quick to mimic the expensive dress of a superior, says consultant Goodrich &amp; Sherwood Co. The boss might resent an underling who tries to match a life style that\\'s taken years of work to achieve. . . .

       " 'WSJ870317-0085': '--- By Philip R. Alper</HL> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN> The patient\\'s eyes brim with tears.  \"Couldn\\'t you give me a month off work?\" she asks pleadingly.  This is the world of disability evaluation and certification, one of medicine\\'s lesser-known byways where art, science and ethics blend in sometimes mysterious ways.  Only a handful of physicians earn their livings determining disabilities. And in a sad incident last month, a doctor died that way: Peter-Cyrus Rizzo III, a New York surgeon, died Feb. 6 after being shot the day earlier by a retired firefighter whose request for an additional disability pension allowance had just been rejected by a panel of doctors. For the rest of us, the task of figuring out degrees and lengths of incapacity constitutes one of many relatively distasteful bureaucratic chores.  Sometimes that task is very straightforward. The loss of an eye or limb, for example, may be directly related to the requirements of a job and periods of disability may be determined objectively. More often, however, the issues are blurred. The emotional status of the patient, how the patient feels about the job and particularly about relations with supervisory personnel, and the cultural biases of both patient and physician all combine to produce a result that is likely to be more impressionistic than definitive.  There is a wide variation in thinking about how sick one is and how important time off is in order to get well. The patients\\' responsibilities outside of work also vary. It\\'s hard to say to what degree these factors should influence disability status. Most physicians probably consider them important.  \"Why do you feel you can\\'t work?\" I ask my patient. Her condition is an unusual affliction of the scalp, causing hair loss, itching and pain.  \"I\\'m ashamed to be seen and I can\\'t stop scratching,\" she answers. The woman, who is known to me as hard-working and responsible, clearly isn\\'t herself.  When confronted with debatable disability requests, doctors face a great temptation to please the patient. Doing so also keeps the patient coming back to the office and maintains a steady stream of fees. This temptation, however, is not different from those faced in other areas of medicine where professional ethics remain the principal barrier against providing unnecessary or improper treatment.  There are certainly places where sick-slips are for sale. Pseudo-injuries and pseudo-illnesses leading to phony insurance claims provide grist for the mills of investigative reporters. No doubt there are also lesser degrees of dishonesty. But everyday reality is much more humdrum.  Given the patient\\'s opportunity to play the system for personal gain, I\\'ve been surprised at the comparative infrequency of fanciful requests for time off. Perhaps this stems from my own middle-class background with its resulting vibes that stifle them in advance. Or since physicians are known to attract patients who resemble them, it may reflect the similar work ethic of my patients. As many patients push me to return them to work sooner than I think advisable as want to drag their heels.  One of my patients, a disability-claims examiner, is much less sanguine. She fumes at disability rip-offs, at what she sees as a trend for alternative health practitioners, such as chiropractors, to stand behind them, with their opinions receiving equal credence with those of physicians at hearings.  That may be, but there are tough calls. Emotional upset, headaches, backaches and other subjective symptoms are hard to quantify. Besides, someone who truly feels disabled may as a result actually be disabled. A well-timed period of time off with stress reduction and an effort at better understanding may prevent a much worse disability later. It may also uncover factors at the workplace that can be improved. I try to give the patient the benefit of the doubt within reason. Not doing so is more than unkind; it risks harm to the patient and lawsuits that neither the physician nor employer would welcome.  After a major illness, fears about employability and ability to handle stress are commonplace. They have to be addressed in order to ensure a good outcome. I\\'ve been frustrated by lack of a formal job description furnished by the employer. Too often I\\'ve been told by the employer that an initial trial period of part-time or light duty can\\'t be accommodated. \"My insurance doesn\\'t allow it\" shuts me up but doesn\\'t help the patient\\'s transition from illness to health.  One final aspect of the disability scene bears mention: It is loaded with absurdities that result from mixing science with politics. Hereditary disabilities of patients in the military are considered service-connected if discovered while on active duty. Heart attacks of California police and firemen are statutorially deemed related to job stress and compensible even if they occur at the gambling tables in Las Vegas.  In the absence of an exact science and lacking the descent of a professor of disability ethics from Mt. Olympus, I\\'ve developed a rule: Coddle people a little but aim to keep them active and productive.  As for our patient, persistence and persuasiveness got her two weeks off, and a later one-week extension.  --- Dr. Alper is a clinical associate professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, and an internist in Burlingame, Calif.

Pacific Lighting also said it is considering forming a master limited partnership or making a public offering of equity in the real estate unit, called Pacific Lighting Real Estate Group.  The group earned $24.2 million last year and has about 800 employees, mostly in Southern California, the company said.  Pacific Lighting\\'s major units include Southern California Gas Co., a natural gas utility, and Thrifty Corp., which operates drug and discount stores. Pacific Lighting also is involved in oil and gas exploration and production.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pacific Lighting shares rose $1.125, to close at $54.25.  \"Selling all or part of our land development operation is consistent with our intent to concentrate our resources on those business lines with the potential to produce higher values for our shareholders,\" said Paul A.

       " 'WSJ870317-0079': 'Statist Economics</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> A group of state attorneys general held a press conference last week to present their own \"merger guidelines.\" They say they\\'ll use them to stop takeovers that the Justice Department would approve. The AGs represented eight states, including New York, California and Ohio. Conspicuous by his absence was Charles Oberly, the attorney general of the state that has the most riding on the efficient market, Delaware.  The second-smallest state gets nearly 20% of its revenues from state charter fees, so it\\'s careful not to pursue laws that scare off investors in companies incorporated there. Except for the 1985 Household International case upholding a nasty poison pill, Delaware law usually keeps a level field between acquirers and targets. Other states are tilting that balance, and will do Delaware a great favor if they challenge mergers on the basis of hoary antitrust theories of \"market concentration.\" Delaware could end up with the monopoly concession for corporate charters.  The vague \"merger guidelines\" are not so much enforcement guidelines as notice that many states are adding to their cache of extreme anti-takeover bills. In 1985, New York slammed into place a five-year waiting period before a hostile bidder can merge with a target or sell any of its assets. Since then many states have toyed with laws aimed at keeping companies in their states.  The most recent example is Ohio, which may find that its success in returning tax windfalls to taxpayers, described here yesterday, is rubbed out by discouraging business investment. In response to Jimmy Goldsmith\\'s bid for Goodyear of Akron, the state passed a deadly poison pill. Directors got carte blanche to issue preferred shares to everyone except the bidder, and were even relieved of legal liability for violating their fiduciary duty to maximize share prices. This law was supposed to expire March 1, but Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste has decided to make it permanent. He told legislators that he wants to \"discourage unrestricted hostile takeovers\" and \"keep us competitive with other corporate-conscious states.\"  Gov. Celeste may find these goals hard to reconcile. The managers of some companies will delight in knowing their jobs are safe no matter what happens to the share price. More enlightened managers will worry that if their firms are relieved of the pressure of the market for corporate control, they may have a hard time raising funds. This is especially true of start-up firms that need big infusions of capital. As George Anders reported in the Journal last Tuesday, big institutional investors are beginning to tell managers to choose between their continued support and adopting poison pills. The benefits of restructuring through mergers is no longer a matter of debate in the stock exchanges -- or among pension-fund managers.  The market could get a boost from the Supreme Court when it rules on Indiana\\'s stiff anti-takeover law. In recent oral argument, lawyers for Dynamics Corp. said its merger with CTS Corp. of Elkhart was impossible until the Seventh Circuit invalidated the Indiana law. The law imposes a 50-day delay on tender offers and requires a vote of \"disinterested\" shareholders. In 1982 the high court invalidated an Illinois anti-takeover law that violated the commerce-clause requirement of free trade in securities and violated the supremacy clause because it was more favorable than the Williams Act to target firms.  There\\'s a lesson in all this for Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), who\\'s leading the fight to protect entrenched managers. States tilting the balance in takeovers to favor incumbent local executives will force the most efficient firms to move to places like Delaware. Federalism thus limits the damage state regulations can do. But there is no such limit to the damage that Congress can do if it federalizes laws protecting managers at shareholders\\' expense. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0076': 'Taxing Japan</HL> The tax revolt has hit Japan.  Prime Minister Nakasone has proposed a new 5% sales tax -- to \"offset\" proposed reductions in marginal rates on income. As a result, his highly disciplined people have taken to the streets in protest. His popularity rating has dropped by a third to about 25%. Last week a member of his Liberal Democratic Party lost a by-election in the rural and traditionally LDP prefecture of Iwate, where the winning Japan Socialist Party candidate came out foursquare against the sales tax. The popularity of the Nakasone cabinet has likewise plunged in the polls, and the Japanese foreign minister was forced last Wednesday to cancel a trip to America, despite the need to counter the protectionist mood of the U.S. Congress.  The voters, in short, think the Prime Minister is trying to dive-bomb their wallets. The voters have it right and the experts in the Treasury have it wrong. This should be a lesson to the Canadians, British and everyone else setting out to reform their taxes in the wake of what President Reagan has wrought in the U.S.  The voters don\\'t share Mr. Nakasone\\'s overriding concern that a tax-reform package must be \"revenue neutral.\" All the signs are that the voters prefer tax cuts, pure and simple. Now, before the experts around the world start to talk about demagogy and the ungovernability of democracies and such, let us translate the voters\\' instinct into more technical language:  They can take or leave revenue neutrality, the notion that in a good tax reform the burden might shift but total revenue should remain the same. But the voters are not such fools as to believe in \"static analysis,\" the notion that revenue projections should be based on the assumption that changes in the tax code will have no effect on taxpayer behavior. To believe anything so silly you have to be an expert in one of the world\\'s Treasuries or maybe an international institution.  The Japanese government\\'s difficulties bear watching, since Treasury after Treasury is contemplating the kind of plan that has Mr. Nakasone in such hot water. Seeing the top U.S. income-tax rate plunge to 28%, and trying to keep top marginal rates low enough to stem the brain drain, they all want to increase sales taxes or other indirect taxes. There is a germ of sense here, for a low, broad-based tax would leave people with a lot more incentive to produce than does the current progressive tax system. Mr. Nakasone\\'s cuts in direct taxes, both personal and corporate, could indeed help damp the rising unemployment rate and boost the flagging Japanese economy.  But then along comes static-analysis revenue neutrality. Mr. Nakasone proposes to cut the top marginal rate for personal income taxes to 50% from the current 70%, but then \"make up\" for the \"lost\" revenues with the sales tax. So the static analysts figure out how much the Treasury took in at 70%, then tot up the \"revenue loss.\" They assume that all the same people earn all the same income and will tell the tax collectors all the same things at 50% as they did at 70%. Then the static analysts know how big a sales tax they need.  But cutting rates from 70% to 50% does not reduce revenues, it increases them. Experts don\\'t like this dynamic phenomenon because it mars the precision of their arithmetic, but by now we have pretty good data on taxpayer behavior in the U.S., and even some from Britain. With a plan like the Nakasone version, this dynamic effect means that if you \"make up\" for the \"lost\" revenues, the government actually gets more revenue from the lower income tax, and then socks on a sales tax on top of it. So \"revenue neutrality\" means a tax increase.  Mr. Nakasone has been insisting that his plan would be \"the best policy for Japan,\" as he recently told a parliamentary budget committee, though he was reelected last year on an LDP platform that promised there would be no new broad-based tax, and though voters go to the polls in local elections April 12. Clearly it would be tough at this stage for Mr. Nakasone to rework a tax package in which he has invested so much of his own political capital. But he will have a worse time should he stick with a sales tax that has cost him plenty.  There is one clear path out of Prime Minister Nakasone\\'s troubles. To wit, recognize that the electorate is smarter than the Treasury. It may not be as good at arithmetic, but it can feel a tax increase in its bones. And it is a lesson to be remembered by other Prime Ministers and other Treasuries throughout the world. ',\n",

Under terms of a settlement with Mutual Shares Corp., a New York investment firm, the nation\\'s largest airline holding company agreed to increase its price for the Continental shares it didn\\'t already own by $3.75 to $20.25. The settlement also could benefit holders of the 7.2 million, or 26%, of Continental shares once held outside of Texas Air, but since purchased by the company.  If accepted by all minority holders, the settlement would add $27 million to the total of approximately $200 million that Texas Air agreed to pay for the shares last month. In the settlement, Texas Air also agreed to pay the plantiff\\'s legal fees, which a Mutual Shares lawyer estimated to total nearly $470,000.  But the settlement doesn\\'t mean an end to the legal challenges by minority holders. For one, shareholders may refuse to participate in the settlement by continuing to demand appraisal of their shares in the Delaware Chancery courts, where the Mutual Shares suit and other suits have been filed. In addition, American General Corp., an insurance holding company based here that held warrants to buy five million Continental shares, said it may continue pressing a lawsuit against Texas Air, which nullified those warrants in the purchase.  Texas Air declined to comment beyond a statement outlining terms of the settlement. The company\\'s agreement to increase the purchase price to $20.25 a share -- from the $14.50 it initially proposed -- was a rare concession of ground by Texas Air\\'s tough-bargaining chairman, Frank Lorenzo.  In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texas Air shares closed at $41.625, down 87.5 cents.  \"It\\'s an excellent settlement,\" said William Klein II, attorney for Mutual Shares. \"A trial could have been a year away and with an uncertain result\" given the volatility of the airline industry and the recent softness in Texas Air\\'s stock price, Mr. Klein added.  Texas Air, which acquired control of Continental in 1981, first proposed buying out the carrier\\'s other shareholders for $14.50 a share in July 1985. Texas Air sweetened its bid to $15.20 a share in April 1986, after Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., financial adviser to the Continental board committee reviewing the proposed purchase, indicated that was the lowest price it would deem fair.  Mutual Shares sued last September, calling the price unfairly low. Texas Air increased the price 10 cents a share, but simultaneously withdrew the minority shareholders\\' right to reject the plan. Last December, Texas Air raised the price to $16.50 during litigation, although it claimed the increase wasn\\'t prompted by the lawsuits.  The settlement follows a ruling last month by a Delaware judge, who denied an injunction delaying the Texas Air purchase but said that the plan \"leaves a great deal to be desired.\" He said the minority shareholders had demonstrated that Texas Air\\'s proposal was unfair, but that they could seek recovery in the courts.  The settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware court after a notice of the settlement has been mailed to shareholders. Texas Air said the process will take about two months. ',\n",

The exchanges said they signed licensing agreements to market and trade new futures and options products based on the Europe, Australia and Far East index published by Morgan Stanley Capital International, a unit of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co.  The EAFE-based contracts require approval from both futures and securities regulators, officials of the exchanges said. It is unclear what international regulatory and order-processing agreements may be needed before trading can begin, they said.  The Chicago Merc would trade futures on the index and options on those futures, while the CBOE would trade cash-settled options on the index, the exchanges said. The new contracts wouldn't begin trading until sometime next year at the earliest, said Chicago Merc's president, William Brodsky.  The EAFE index includes stocks traded in 16 countries, with Japanese stocks accounting for more than one-half of the index's value. The countries with the next highest weightings in the index are the United Kingdom, West Germany and Switzerland.  Morgan Stanley officials said they were talking with the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or Simex, about listing EAFE futures there as well.  Last year the Chicago Merc applied to trade futures on the Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A futures contract on the Nikkei 225 already trades on the Simex. The Merc expects regulatory approval to trade the Nikkei index later this year. \",\n",

The truck and engine maker is recalling 33,000 trucks and 19,000 buses to modify the electrical power supply to the backup braking system. It said the vehicles have electrically operated hydraulic pumps integral to the brake master cylinder, which provide backup power assist to the brakes in the event the primary power is lost.  Navistar said an electrical failure in the main engine wiring harness could stall the engine, knocking out the primary power assist to the brakes, while simultaneously shutting off electrical power to the backup pump, rendering the vehicle's service brakes inoperable.  Navistar said owners of an additional 61,000 vehicles will be notified at the same time to remind them of procedures they can follow to ensure that the vehicles' backup braking system continues to function as designed, even though these vehicles don't contain the defect.  The company said the brake problem, which will cost it about $1 million, was brought to its attention by the U.S. Postal Service, after one of its trucks experienced such an electrical failure. \",\n",

In addition, the holding company said it expects its first-quarter earnings could fall as much as 41%.  Capitol said the 1986 earnings may be restated because of a recommendation by its auditors that the company reclassify loans of its principal subsidiary, Capitol Bank and Trust Co., and establish additional reserves to support that classification. Previously, the company said it earned $7.7 million, or $2.66 a share, last year, down from $10.9 million, or $2.76 a share, in 1985.  Capitol also said its first-quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.25 million to $2.75 million. In the year-ago period, the company had earnings of $3.8 million, or $1.96 a share. Karl Walczak, president of Capitol Bank and Trust, said the current-quarter estimate is a \"conservative one\" because the bank had booked a number of loans in last year\\'s first quarter that haven\\'t yet accrued interest in the current quarter.

The investment advisory company said net income for the period ended Jan. 31 more than doubled to $5.2 million, or 52 cents a share, from $2.5 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.  Revenue for the quarter rose 23% to $17.7 million from $14.4 million a year earlier, Value Line said.  The company largely ascribed the third-quarter earnings jump to a $3.1 million rise in investment income; in the year-ago period, the company received $386,000 in investment income. The company said the rise reflected, among other things, receipt of $2.9 million of capital gains distributions from its mutual fund investments.  For the nine-month period ended Jan. 31, Value Line said earnings rose 65% to $11.5 million, or $1.16 a share, from $7 million, or 70 cents a share.

The meetings, involving dozens of airlines, began here under a Transportation Department grant of immunity from antitrust prosecution and are expected to continue today and tomorrow. Federal Aviation Administration officials, who are supervising the talks, want the airlines to make more than 200 schedule changes at five major airports.  \"That would bring us a 10% to 15% reduction\" in the number of flights delayed more than 15 minutes, said John Ryan, director of the FAA\\'s air traffic operations.  For Newark Airport, the carriers yesterday agreed to shift 13 flights out of the crowded 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. period. FAA officials said they were satisfied.  For Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare Airport, United Airlines, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Inc., and American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp., agreed to make 33 changes. Mr. Ryan said that 20 or 30 more are needed at O\\'Hare.  The airlines today are expected to finish discussing O\\'Hare and turn to the biggest challenge -- Atlanta\\'s Hartsfield Airport, where Mr. Ryan estimates 150 schedule changes are needed. Schedule changes for Philadelphia and Dallas-Fort Worth airports probably will be agreed upon tomorrow.  Four years ago, the airlines participated in similar -- but much more extensive -- negotiations. Those talks covered six airports and resulted in 1,300 schedule revisions. Delays subsequently declined, though the airlines contend that the schedule juggling played only a minor part. ',\n",

While Houston lost jobs in the past year and Dallas barely held its own, the chronically depressed cities along the Rio Grande have been adding jobs at a healthy clip. Figures just released by the Texas Employment Commission highlight an unusual situation: double-digit unemployment in communities along the Mexican border coexisting with rapid employment growth.  Take McAllen, in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley and the center of Texas\\'s citrus-growing region. McAllen had 21% unemployment in January, the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S. Yet employment in the McAllen area grew 4% in the 12 months ending in January. That\\'s a yearlong job-creation rate unsurpassed by San Antonio, Fort Worth, Austin, and any other major Texas community.  Three other border cities accustomed to hard times have been adding jobs at a pace well above the state average. El Paso\\'s employment rose 3% in the year ending in January. In Laredo and Brownsville-Harlingen, job growth was 2%. For Texas as a whole, employment was essentially flat in the same period. All three of these border communities had unemployment rates in two figures.  Observers suggest several reasons for the border employment boomlet. Citrus orchards destroyed by the killer freeze of 1983 are beginning to produce once again. The population of \"winter Texans,\" Midwesterners who flee to south Texas to escape the cold, is also on the rise, and with it, service-industry jobs catering to the visitors.  In El Paso, defense dollars pumped into the Army\\'s Fort Bliss and nearby White Sands Missile Range have bolstered job growth.  But the big factor in border employment appears to be the rapid expansion of the \"maquila\" industry. This so-called twin-plant system permits non-Mexican companies to set up assembly plants in Mexico and manufacture there for immediate export to the U.S. and elsewhere.  Although the bulk of the job growth has been in Mexico\\'s northern tier, the roughly 900 maquila factories have attracted a sizable infrastructure of suppliers and transport companies on the U.S. side of the border. \"Most people in the North think these jobs are only in Mexico. That\\'s just not the case,\" says Tommy Joyner, president of the McAllen Chamber of Commerce.  --- CALIFORNIANS APPEAR LESS BUOYANT about the future. The annual \"economic well-being\" survey by San Francisco-based Field Institute found only 24% of those polled saying they expected California\\'s economy to improve in the next 12 months. That\\'s the smallest share in the seven years the question has been asked.  Although 51% said the state was enjoying good times, the percentage of respondents who said they were better off financially than last year, and who predicted they\\'d be in even better shape next year, was down from recent years. About one-quarter of respondents said it was a bad time to make a major purchase, roughly twice as many as thought that way a year ago.  --- IT\\'S THE EFFORT THAT COUNTS. New Jersey, facing horrendous toxic-waste problems, gets top marks from an environmental group for its toxic-waste and solid-waste cleanup programs. California, where smog is a perennial problem, rates highest among the states in air-pollution reduction. \"Some states with the worst problems have the best programs,\" says the Washington, D.C.-based Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment.  The group gives Wisconsin the nod for overall environmental effort among states. The lowest environmental scores go to Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi.  --- THE BOSTON GLOBE PUSHES NORTH in a major way next month when it adds a New Hampshire supplement to its Sunday edition. The 16-to-20-page section will allow New Hampshire advertisers to buy space in the Sunday Globe at reduced rates. The Globe\\'s new section is a further challenge to New Hampshire\\'s largest paper, Manchester\\'s legendary Union Leader, whose roughly 20,000 circulation lead over the Sunday Globe has been shrinking.  --- WHAT A PARTY! Parades, costumes, food, drink and assorted hoopla surrounding Mardi Gras generated $239 million in spending in Greater New Orleans last year, says University of New Orleans economist James McLain. More than three-fourths of the money came from tourists taking part in the pre-Lenten carnival. Among Prof. McLain\\'s documented spending: $192,000 for plastic beads and trinkets tossed from parade floats to street revelers. (By contrast, Pasadena, Calif., officials say they reaped $1.6 million in added consumer spending from last January\\'s Super Bowl.)  --- THE BEST-SELLING CAR MODELS in the Far West and Rocky Mountain states in 1986 were the Honda Accord, Honda Civic, and Nissan Sentra, says auto industry data specialist R.L.

A spokesman said the company couldn\\'t yet determine net results for the quarter and declined to give an estimate. In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had profit of $93.8 million from operations. For the same period, it had net income of $39.4 million, or $1.12 a share, on revenue of $1.71 billion, excluding excise taxes.  John R. Hall, chairman and chief executive officer, said \"while we are encouraged by recent favorable developments in petroleum markets, in January and February, Ashland Petroleum Co. was unable to increase product prices enough to recover increased crude oil costs, and operated at a loss in both months.\"  Ashland, which is primarily a refiner and marketer, produces little of its own crude. As a result, the company benefits when prices for crude oil drop more rapidly than prices of gasoline and other refined products.  Separately, Mr. Hall said Ashland completed a previously announced plan to recover excess assets in some of its pension plans. The assets were used to pre-pay most of the $225 million debt incurred last year in the creation of a leveraged employee stock ownership plan.  As a result, Mr. Hall said Ashland expects to post a one-time after-tax credit of about $10 million for the quarter. He said, however, that it is difficult to determine whether that amount \"will be sufficient to offset the expected operating loss.\"  Mr. Hall noted that Ashland\\'s performance usually is stronger in the second half because of summer demand for petroleum products and the summer construction market. \"We are optimistic that refining margins will continue to improve as we enter the second half of the year.\" ',\n",

Fixed-rate issues were much less active during a session some traders characterized as \"boring,\" and two Euroyen issues represented the only major new offerings.  The choppy trading in floating-rate notes appeared to be a continuation of Friday\\'s activity, in which some lower-rated floating-rate notes lost as much as 3/4 point. Yesterday, trading continued in a similar pattern, with prices of some long-dated bank issues swinging up and down in a three-point range.  Traders said four banks out of a total of about 35 in the floating-rate note markets didn\\'t open trading. And one, Orion Royal Bank Ltd., said it is leaving the floating-rate note markets more or less permanently.  But Peter J. Hesson, an Orion official, said the bank made its decision to abandon floating-rate notes 10 days earlier, after its position had become \"flat\" in that portion of the markets. \"The market may become interesting again, and we may decide to establish a trading capability in it,\" Mr. Hesson said. \"But this (move out of floating-rate notes) isn\\'t temporary.\"  A trader at one U.S. house that isn\\'t trading floating-rate notes said that market\\'s problems are likely to be temporary, but that the bank had halted market-making because it was dissatisfied with the market\\'s degree of liquidity.  Volatility has gradually increased in the floating-rate note markets in the past year, as investors have begun to favor fixed-rate issues. Last week, the markets were pressured by reports that Japanese banks expect to sell major floating-rate note holdings to meet anticipated capital requirements.  But some floating-rate note specialists contend that there still is strong demand for top-quality floating-rate notes, such as some sovereigns, ensuring the continued survival of the sector.  Investors remained out of fixed-rate Eurodollar markets yesterday, as they have for at least the past month. The result was a mixed market, with little change in prices.  \"We seem to be stuck in a narrow trading range, and that is going to continue until something is new in the currency or in U.S. interest rates,\" said a trader for one U.S. bank. \"I wish people would wake me when that happens.\" ',\n",

James Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN> Becor Western Inc., already the object of a management-led buyout bid, said it received a $255.8 million acquisition proposal from another investor group.  The $15.50-a-share proposal was made in a letter to South Milwaukee, Wis.-based Becor by Investment Limited Partnership of Greenwich, Conn., and Randolph W. Lenz. Mr. Lenz is chairman of Green Bay, Wis.-based Northwest Engineering Co., which purchased Becor\\'s construction-machinery parts business two years ago.  Analysts said the all-cash bid appeared more attractive than last month\\'s proposal from a management-led group that includes William B. Winter, Becor\\'s president. The management-led group agreed to acquire the mining-machinery and aerospace parts maker for cash and debentures with an indicated value of $238.1 million.  Under the management-led proposal, holders of Becor\\'s 16.5 million common shares outstanding would receive $10.45 in cash and $4 face amount of senior sinking fund debentures for each share. The buyout proposal is contingent on Becor\\'s planned sale of its Western Gear Corp. aerospace unit for $117 million to Lucas Industries PLC of England.  Details regarding the management-led group\\'s financing arrangement and potential response to the latest bid aren\\'t yet clear, analysts said.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Becor shares rose 75 cents to close at $15.625.  Norris K. Ekstrom, Becor\\'s chairman, said the company would evaluate the latest bid. Mr. Ekstrom isn\\'t part of the management-led group that made the earlier proposal. The company also said it has received other \"expressions of interest,\" but declined to be specific.  The new proposal is contingent on Becor receiving at least $110 million in proceeds from the Western Gear sale. It also hinges on the \"satisfactory outcome of a due diligence investigation,\" in which the potential buyer gets to examine nonpublic corporate data, Becor said.  Becor said it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission preliminary proxy materials for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the Western Gear sale and management-led leveraged buyout proposal. \"The first offer is a firm offer,\" said Mr. Ekstrom. \"We don\\'t know if the new one is firm,\" he added.  Andrew Silver, a securities analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said he doesn\\'t expect the latest proposal to result in a bidding war because both bids are at the high end of the company\\'s value.  Analysts have said demand for mining machinery is expected to be flat this year. Helen Walters, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said: \"Mining is a tough business.

Since 1978, the burgeoning exchange has been headed, with little opposition, by Michel D. Marks, who recently decided to step down to form a new company. Mr. Marks\\'s resignation followed a scandal at Paris Securities Corp., a Merc clearing firm run by his family that has been accused of misappropriating customer funds and currently is under federal investigation.  \"It\\'s been a long time since (the Merc election) has even been a contest,\" said one floor trader. Added a New York Merc official: \"It\\'s just too close to call -- we were thinking of doing an exit poll.\" More than 700 exchange members are eligible to vote.  The two candidates -- William M. Bradt, an independent floor trader, and Stanley R. Meierfeld, Merc vice chairman -- are both members of the exchange\\'s board. But that\\'s about all they have in common, traders and exchange members say.  Mr. Bradt, a 41-year-old Vietnam veteran, is seen as a \"more organized, spit-and-polish type of guy, reflecting his military background,\" said George Gero, a vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, and a Merc board member. Mr. Bradt, who trades in the heating oil and gasoline pits, is also more visible and better known among traders. \"We feel Bill is more a part of us by constantly trading on the floor,\" said one trader.  In addition, Mr. Bradt, who appears in an energy futures advertisement for the Merc, is perceived by members as someone who believes the exchange should be more in the public eye, and would be willing to spend more money for marketing, among other things. Many members consider Mr. Bradt the front-runner, moreover, because he is the candidate chosen by the exchange\\'s nominating committee.  Mr. Bradt, who helped launch the exchange\\'s popular new option contract on crude oil futures, says he will try to improve the trading space and booth allocation among members. \"Our stupendous growth has left some problems on the floor,\" he says.  On the other hand, Mr. Meierfeld, the write-in candidate and currently a vice president at Geldermann Inc., is viewed as more analytical and cautious, mirroring his background in back-office operations, traders say.  Mr. Meierfeld, 39, is a third-generation exchange member; his father and grandfather traded egg futures, among other things, on the exchange. And some traders say that\\'s where he will gain most of his support. \"I have to go with Stanley -- our families go way back,\" one floor trader said.  For his part, Mr. Meierfeld says he wants the exchange to continue its recent growth, while \"cautiously keeping an eye on the bottom line.\" He adds: \"I wouldn\\'t want us to become fat, dumb and happy and get caught napping\" by unnecessary spending.  Whoever wins will have big shoes to fill. Under Mr. Marks, the New York Merc has become the nation\\'s fastest-growing futures exchange. Trading volume doubled last year from the 1985 total, propelling the exchange to third place among the nation\\'s futures markets. Some futures industry officials caution, however, that further growth will depend on the exchange\\'s ability to branch out beyond energy contracts, which make up most of its volume.  The New York Merc has said that the election winner will immediately fly to Boca Raton, Fla., to represent it at this week\\'s annual convention of the Futures Industry Association. Both men are preparing for the convention, but Mr. Bradt says he wasn\\'t able to pack his bags until last night because he was waiting for his wife to leave on a trip with his children. \"I never told her I was running,\" he said with a laugh.

Continuing indications that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is holding down production led to some of the day\\'s gains, traders said. These included a report from the Middle East Economic Survey, a respected industry publication, that OPEC production for March was running about 11%, or 1.8 million barrels a day, below the cartel\\'s output ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day.  Moreover, the OPEC News Agency reported that Saudi Arabia currently is producing about three million barrels of crude oil a day, 27% below its quota of more than four million barrels.  The production level \"reflects Saudi Arabia\\'s commitment to the (OPEC) December agreement,\" the news agency quoted Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer as saying. The oil cartel agreed at that time to cut its output by 7% and to set fixed prices of about $18 a barrel.  \"It\\'s apparent that OPEC has reached consensus to stick to the production agreement, and that if they\\'re going to lose sales because of fixed prices, so be it,\" said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., New York.  Yesterday\\'s strong buying interest in fuel oil stemmed partly from tightness in supplies in New York harbor, said James Ritterbusch, the Chicago-based vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures prices for April delivery rose 28 cents, to $18.64 a barrel. April heating oil contracts soared 1.24 cents a gallon, to 51.65 cents; unleaded gasoline futures prices also rose.  Spot, or noncontract, prices also posted gains. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 30 cents, to $18.65 a barrel. And the March price of North Sea Brent, a major European blend, rose 15 cents, to $18 in late trading.  Some traders were reluctant to participate, however, until tonight\\'s weekly inventory statistics are released by the American Petroleum Institute. Last week, significant drops in inventories and refinery utilization sparked a price rally.  \"If there are further (inventory and refiner-use) declines, this market could explode to the upside,\" said one trader in New York.  In other futures markets yesterday:  FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Most futures prices rose as traders, beginning in Tokyo, then continuing in London and New York, sold dollars to try and discover the price level at which foreign central banks would intervene in support of the dollar, analysts said. Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va., said he didn\\'t think the central banks of the largest industial countries would intervene in support of the dollar until West German mark futures \"get about 30 higher.\" Mark futures yesterday closed .0052 higher at .5489.  STOCK INDEXES: Most futures prices ended lower as traders continued a sell-off that began Friday afternoon. Weakness in the bond futures market and the dollar also added to the stock-index futures\\' decline, traders said. \"The market\\'s likely to move lower over the next few days, but that\\'s a good buying opportunity,\" said John Gustafson, an analyst with Discount Corp. of New York Futures, in Chicago. \"There were some sell programs as futures sold at a discount to stocks, but not much setting up for the March expiration\" Friday when stock-index futures, options and individual stock options expire, said Gerald Walsh, an analyst with PrudentialBache Securities Inc. Some analysts have predicted that if stock-index futures traded at a large enough discount to the underlying stocks in the index this week, traders would buy the index futures and sell stocks. On Friday at expiration they would buy the stocks back and let their contracts expire at the same price as the stocks.  COCOA: Futures prices rose on the growing expectation that producing and consuming countries would agree on buffer stock details, enabling the new International Cocoa Agreement to take effect, analysts said. Formal talks on the buffer stock will begin tomorrow in London, but consuming nations met yesterday to discuss their position. Both sides were said to be approaching the negotiations with more flexible attitudes, the analysts added. The International Cocoa Organization, which administers the agreement, has about $240 million at its disposal to buy cocoa. The remaining buffer stock questions include whether the manager of the stock should buy from both members and non-member producing nations and whether a premium should be paid for quality cocoa beans. Dealers are buying cocoa because current prices are below the minimum support range, said Giles Evans, analyst for GNI Ltd., commercial brokers. Some believe that the recent crash in coffee prices \"will concentrate (the cocoa conferees\\') minds,\" improving chances for an agreement, he said. The coffee collapse followed recent International Coffee Organization talks in London, where negotiators failed to agree on conditions for reinstating export quotas to replace those suspended early last year.  SUGAR: Futures prices declined, with nearby contract prices particularly soft in response to Pakistan\\'s failure to bid for supplies. Pakistan had been expected to offer to buy as much as 100,000 metric tons of sugar during the weekend. \"The concern now is that Pakistan may not need the sugar,\" one analyst said. Once the price of the May contract broke below eight cents a pound, aggressive stop-loss selling depressed prices sharply, he added. India yesterday was seeking to buy as much as 30,000 tons of sugar and the price and quantity of the offerings it receives could be a factor in the market, analysts said. While India has received large offerings on previous tenders, the prices have been high, an analyst said. \"If that pattern is repeated,\" he said, \"it could be a supporting influence even if India is offered a large quantity.\"  LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: A cattle-on-feed report released by the Agriculture Department after yesterday\\'s close is expected to have little effect on today\\'s market. The report, which showed a 15% increase from the year before in the number of young cattle placed on feedlots in seven major beef producing states in February, was factored into the market last week on the basis of analysts\\' estimates, analysts said. The report also showed a 3% decline from a year earlier in the number of animals on feed as of March 1. Sales for slaughter during February were even with the year before. Cattle future prices were unchanged to slightly higher yesterday as the market awaited release of the report and higher prices for boxed beef, analysts said. ',\n",

In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Seton shares rose $3, to $16.  Seton said the bid from Philip D. Kaltenbacher, chairman and chief executive officer, was subject to arranging necessary financing. Mr. Kaltenbacher owns about 30% of the company's 7,690,000 shares. At the tentative offering price, purchase of the remaining shares would cost about $85 million.  Members of management, other than Mr. Kaltenbacher, own about 7.5% of Seton's shares.  Seton tans and distributes leather, is a supplier to medical-products makers and produces chemicals and coatings. In 1986 it earned $7.9 million, or $1.04 a share, on $113 million in revenue.  The Seton chairman proposed to acquire the company in a leveraged buyout and intends to invite certain members of senior management to participate in the purchase. A leveraged buyout is financed by debt that is repaid from the sale of assets or cash generated from the acquired operations.  Neither Mr. Kaltenbacher nor other Seton officials could be reached for comment.  Seton's directors have appointed an independent committee of outside directors to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to the board, the company statement said. Seton also said it will postpone its annual meeting, which was scheduled for March 31, until it has made a decision about Mr. Kaltenbacher's proposal. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0055': \"To Exit Chapter 11, Pay Out $63.8 Million</HL> BANKRUPTCIES (BCY) </IN> Salant Corp. filed a proposed reorganization plan to pay about $63.8 million in claims to unsecured creditors.  The apparel maker is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. It filed for protection from creditors' lawsuits in February 1985.  In the latest filing, Salant said it signed a new five-year employment agreement, subject to approval of the plan, with its president and chief executive officer, Ray W. Williams. Mr. Williams had been hired as a consultant when the company entered reorganization proceedings. He had been authorized to act as president and chief executive since March 1985.  Under the proposed plan, which has been approved by a committee of unsecured creditors and a committee of equity security holders, most Salant creditors and two subsidiaries would receive, for every $1,000 of unsecured claims, $450 in cash, $500 principal amount of senior debentures and four shares of common stock. The debentures would pay interest of 13.25% a year and be traded publicly.  Under the plan, existing holders, who owned 3.3 million common shares, will own about 90% of the common in the reorganized company. The plan calls for Mr. Williams to receive a bonus of 100,000 shares and options to buy another 300,000 shares over a four-year period. Some shares will be reserved for other Salant officers and employees. If all options were exercised, Mr. Williams would hold a 9.42% interest in the company.  The plan indicated Salant's assets would decline to $64.8 million from $95.3 million, while liabilities would decline to $47.8 million from $82.9 million. A statement of projected net income indicates the company -- which had a $5 million loss in the year ended last Nov. 29, on $131.1 million of sales -- could earn $4.1 million in fiscal 1987 on $129.9 million of sales. The fiscal 1986 loss included a one-time charge of $9.4 million related to the Chapter 11 filing and satisfaction of claims.  A bankruptcy court hearing on the disclosure statement is scheduled for April 9, to be followed by a hearing to approve the reorganization plan.  Salant said it has substantially concluded negotiations for an unsecured $15 million line of credit. \",\n",

McCarthy Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Endotronics Inc. said it expects to run out of cash and credit as early as May and that its founders and top two officers stepped down amid investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Minnesota Department of Commerce.  The Minneapolis-based biotechnology company said in a statement that it may sell assets to raise funds, but that its ability to obtain funds has been hurt by a previously reported shareholder lawsuit, accusing management of issuing \"fraudulent financial and operating reports\" to inflate the value of the company\\'s common stock. The company said it intends to \"defend the suit vigorously.\"  Endotronics executives couldn\\'t be reached to elaborate on the statement.  The announcements caused the price of Endotronics\\'s already-weak common stock to plunge 43.8% in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Endotronics closed at $2.25 a share, down $1.75. Since January, the price of Endotronics shares has fallen from the low $20s, as the company reported a loss for its fiscal first-quarter ended Dec. 31 and adopted cost-cutting measures, including reducing its work force by one-third. The stock\\'s 52-week high is $23 a share.  Endotronics said the SEC was conducting an \"informal inquiry,\" in which the company was cooperating. The Minnesota Department of Commerce is investigating Endotronics\\'s Japanese sales for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1986, and trading by \"insiders and brokers in the company\\'s common shares,\" the company said.  In light of the investigations and litigation, Endotronics said Eugene I. Gruenberg resigned as chairman, chief executive officer and treasurer, and his son, Micheal L. Gruenberg, as president and chief operating officer. The company said the Gruenbergs, who founded Endotronics in 1981, will continue as directors and employees. Neither could be reached for comment.  Endotronics named chief financial officer John R. Wright Jr. to succeed the elder Mr. Gruenberg as acting chief executive and treasurer. No mention was made of what would happen with the chairman\\'s post. Mr. Wright, who also couldn\\'t be reached, joined the company earlier this month. The company said it hired a search firm to find a permanent chief executive.  Meanwhile, the company said it is in a payment dispute with Yamaha Inc., one of its Japanese distributors, over about $3.7 million in overdue accounts receivable for biomedical equipment. Endotronics said it doesn\\'t know if it can collect on the accounts and is considering establishing a reserve to cover all or part of it.  Endotronics also said it expects to report \"substantial losses\" for its second quarter ending March 31 and for fiscal 1987. The company said it expects revenue for the year also will be substantially lower.  In the year-earlier second quarter, Endotronics had net income of $209,010, or two cents a share, on revenue of $2.7 million. In fiscal 1986, the company had net of $1.3 million, or 13 cents a share, including a tax benefit of $878,000, on revenue of $13.1 million. ',\n",

The new estimate indicates that the offering, which consists of the 85% stake in the freight railroad now held by the federal government, will raise between $1.53 billion and $1.7 billion, before underwriters\\' fees are subtracted. The railroad expects to offer 58,750,000 shares.  Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a co-manager of the underwriters, said the offering could occur as early as next week.  Conrail disclosed its new estimate in an amendment to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the original filing, in mid-February, the railroad estimated that the offering price would be between $22 a share and $26 a share, raising total proceeds of $1.29 billion to $1.53 billion.  Conrail and Goldman declined to comment on the revision.  Six co-managing underwriters, plus several smaller U.S. securities firms and others abroad, have been working to generate interest in the offering. \"The demand is very strong,\" said Edward P. Bousa, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, Boston. He added, though, that the higher price could cause his fund to reconsider how many Conrail shares it should buy.  The previous estimate fell short of the $1.7 billion, excluding $300 million already paid the government from Conrail\\'s cash reserves, that Congress had set as a nonbinding goal when it approved the public offering last year.

Mr. Whitehead, who will be 44 years old next week, is currently in a Rome jail awaiting extradition to the U.S.  Last September, Mr. Whitehead pleaded guilty to defrauding 70 clients of $4 million in an advance fee scheme he operated for two years. He would charge clients an advance fee of 1% to arrange financing for their business ventures. If unsuccessful, he would return the money, he assured his clients. He seldom did, officials said.  In one instance, Mr. Whitehead received $210,000 from Knoell Construction Co., of Phoenix, Ariz., to arrange a $21 million financing package. He also defrauded Midwestern Airlines Inc. of Milwaukee of $50,000 as part of a $5 million deal he said he would arrange. Midwestern is now defunct.  On Sept. 26, Mr. Whitehead pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and three counts of grand larceny but was released on a $100,000 bail to await sentencing this month.

       " 'WSJ870317-0051': 'Putting Market-Making in British Stocks --- By David Shirreff and Tom Buerkle Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN> L. Messel &amp; Co., a securities unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers International Inc., intends to reduce the number of British stocks in which it makes markets, a Shearson official said.  Messel is the fourth firm to announce plans to reduce or cease market-making activities in London\\'s increasingly competitive equities markets.  Messel will stop making markets in 50 or 75 of the smaller companies among its current total of about 450 stocks, estimated Jacques Gelardin, chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers International, which is owned by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. of New York. \"We\\'ll be concentrating on those areas where we think we can make money,\" he said. Market-making in government bonds won\\'t be affected, he added.  Market-makers are securities firms or individuals that trade with investors for the market-makers\\' own accounts. They must buy or sell shares during trading hours at prices that are freely disseminated.  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is a unit of American Express Co.  Despite the cuts, \"We\\'re committed to the marketplace\" and to making markets in equities, Mr. Gelardin said. Messel\\'s market-making operation has been profitable since it began last October, although it hasn\\'t gained market share, he said.  In a related development, Scrimgeour Vickers &amp; Co. said it agreed to hire at least eight equities specialists from Greenwell Montagu Securities, the Midland Bank PLC unit that ceased making markets in British stocks yesterday.  The exodus of some of Greenwell Montagu\\'s 38 equities specialists apparently had been planned for several weeks before Midland\\'s announcement late Friday of a withdrawal from market-making in British equities. Midland\\'s decision marked the first big retreat of a major institution in London\\'s newly deregulated markets.  \"We\\'re still on the expansion tack,\" said John Hewitt, managing director of Scrimgeour Vickers, a securities unit of Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd., which Citicorp owns. \"We had 52 market-makers this morning and our target is to have 80 by June.\" He added that Scrimgeour Vickers may hire at least two more Greenwell Montagu equities specialists.  Mr. Hewitt said Scrimgeour Vickers has been profitable in market-making since London\\'s so-called Big Bang Oct. 27. That\\'s when fixed commissions on securities ended and firms began to be allowed to combine brokerage and market-making activities. The new environment confers advantages on heavily capitalized companies. There still is going to be \"a lot of nastiness in the marketplace,\" the Scrimgeour Vickers executive predicted.  Watchers of London\\'s financial markets have forecast that other firms would follow Greenwell Montagu\\'s lead, or at least cut back their equities staffs. But individual firms so far dispute such suggestions.  Messel, for example, yesterday denied rumors that it would reduce some of its 500-member staff. \"It\\'s true we\\'re letting three people go on the sales side,\" Mr. Gelardin said, \"but that\\'s on performance grounds. We\\'re looking to upgrade\" our sales team.  Last week, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays PLC, and Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd. said they were halting their market-making operations in individual sectors of the British stock market.

       " 'WSJ870317-0050': \"Who Goes Home For the Holidays? --- Compiled by the staff of American Demographics magazine</HL> Advertisers who emphasize the importance of family at holidays or vacations may be living out their own fantasies, not those of the American public.  In a study conducted by Research &amp; Forecasts Inc. for Ethan Allen Inc., a furniture maker, only about half of surveyed adults with children think that holidays are an important family time. Vacations ranked even lower; only about 40% of those questioned usually consider vacations as family time.  By contrast, sharing at least one meal a day is an almost universally desired family activity. Three-quarters of families say evenings are an important time for them to be together, and two-thirds consider weekends a family time.  According to the survey, a majority of adults who live in families enjoy being with the rest of the household on a day-to-day basis. On occasion, however, they also want a vacation from the family.  This could mean that it would be more effective to advertise restaurant meals as a family-time experience -- but to market vacations as a get-away-from-everyone experience.  Working Women Working women appear to do a lot with their leisure time -- but watch less television.  Women who work full time have their television on only 28 hours a week, compared with 37.5 hours for women who don't work outside the home, according to a study by Young &amp; Rubicam. By contrast, working women listen to the radio 25 hours a week on average, five more hours than women at home. (The main reason: They listen to the radio while commuting to work.)  Working women were also found to read more newspapers and magazines as well as spend more time at the movies. Additionally, they were more likely to engage in physical-fitness activities, swim, garden, bicycle, go to the theater or a concert and attend adult-education classes.  With all these activities, how do they fit in a 35- to 40-hour work week? Some clues lay in the demographics. Working women are much younger than nonworking women (median age 35 compared with 55), so presumably are more active.  Preventive Care Demand for preventive health-care procedures is increasing, but not among all segments of the population.  Many hospitals and other health providers are turning to preventive-care procedures to make up for revenue lost from more tightly controlled Medicare and insurance payments. According to a nationwide survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, there have been increases in routine physicals, chest X-rays, blood-pressure checks, EKGs, pap smears and breast exams.  But the center's study suggests that these tests are most often used by specific segments of the population. People with higher levels of education, those whose household income is $35,000 or more, and people who live in metropolitan areas are most likely to buy preventive medicine.  For example, 70% of people who live in metropolitan areas have had a routine physical in the past year, but only 57% of nonmetro dwellers have had one.  The study suggests that as the college-educated white-collar labor force continues to expand, the demand for preventive-care procedures will grow as well. And health-care providers in upper-income suburban areas will probably do the best with such services.  Services for Elderly Opportunities are thought to abound for businesses that provide services to the elderly, but what services do they want the most? Judging from responses to a recent survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, one answer is meals.  The survey asked people aged 65 or older what community services they use. Of those who were living alone, 12% said they ate some meals at the senior-citizens center. An additional 4% said they used home-delivered meal services. With the exception of general use of a senior-citizen center, meals were the most widely used service.  Probably the most surprising finding of the survey was that such a low percentage of the elderly use community services. Even among those 75 years old or over, the vast majority didn't use outside prepared meals or other homemaker services.  This indicates that the degree of selfsufficiency among older people may be higher than thought, or that the elderly are not aware that such programs are available. \",\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0049': 'Runs Into Resistance From Military Bureaucracy --- By John J. Fialka Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> CONGRESS (CNG) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> In the U.S. defense establishment, some of the fiercest fighting is waged by military bureaucrats in defense of their turf.  For three years, Congress has been trying to create an interagency program for dealing with \"little wars\" and covert paramilitary operations, such as fighting terrorists. But the effort has been stymied, first by former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, who was overseeing the covert-action network that led to the Iran-Contra scandal, and later by the stolid Pentagon bureaucracy.  Last October, just before the Iran affair became public, Vice Adm. Poindexter wrote a letter assuring the Senate Armed Services Committee that the White House didn\\'t need more help managing covert operations. Coordinating groups within the NSC \"have supported the president\\'s participation in such matters on a continuing basis,\" he declared. According to the recently released Tower Commission report, the \"staff\" doing most of the covert managing consisted of a single officer, Lt. Col. Oliver North, and a collection of private individuals, some of them foreigners.  Supposedly, Congress settled the matter last fall by passing a law ordering the new program; about the same time, Adm. Poindexter was swept from office by the scandal. But now lawmakers are up in arms by what they claim are lingering pockets of resistance in the Defense Department.  \"They are trying to asphyxiate the infant in his crib,\" charges Sen. William Cohen, (R., Maine). \"The general bureaucracy looks with disdain upon it because it does not bring in any big ticket items.\"  The Pentagon recently announced a new joint military command required by the law, but it will be located in Tampa, Fla., instead of nearer to Washington, as Congress had preferred. The new assistant secretary of defense who is to watch over the new U.S. Special Operations Command hasn\\'t been named yet and won\\'t be based in the Pentagon building, near the power centers, but will have a rented office in nearby Rosslyn, Va.  Reps. Earl Hutto, (D., Fla.) and Dan Daniel (D., Va.), the chairmen of two House Armed Services subcommittees, have fired off a letter to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger complaining of \"elements\" within the agency \"who will resort to almost any ploy to keep the legislation from being implemented.\" The Pentagon denies any sabotage.  The law requires the NSC to establish a board for what is known in military jargon as a \"low intensity conflict,\" or LIC. The description covers situations ranging from a single terrorist incident to helping friendly forces in small wars, such as the Contra effort in Nicaragua. The NSC board is supposed to draw on the military and logistic skills of both the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency for future covert paramilitary or military support operations. At the Pentagon, the services are required to relinquish control of most of their special operations forces, such as the Army\\'s Rangers, to the new joint command.  Current and past Pentagon officials concede that the agency hasn\\'t been gung-ho about such efforts. Noel Koch, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, says he spent five years battling for resources to improve U.S. special operations capabilities. The service chiefs, he says, stubbornly resisted any budgetary or manpower shifts that detracted from what they saw as their main mission: preparing for a large conventional war.  Mr. Koch, who resigned from the Pentagon last year, worked with Col. North to carry out the NSC\\'s plan to ship TOW missiles to Iran as part of a hostage trade. He believes the chronic reluctance of the military and the CIA to develop capabilities for small military operations helped tempt Col. North to circumvent the system.  \"Their intransigence . . . led to dealing with the problem in other ways. It all came down to Ollie North,\" Mr. Koch says.  Lawrence Ropka Jr., Mr. Koch\\'s successor who worked with an Air Force special operations unit in Thailand during the Vietnam War, says all such units suffered from inattention as the services rebuilt their conventional forces during the 1970s. Officers who became involved in such units also experienced career problems, Mr. Ropka says. Few were promoted to general or admiral.  Then there is the image problem. While some special military operations involve \"Rambo\"-type heroics, the mission of counterinsurgency units can extend to medical aid and help in civic affairs. Mr. Ropka, for example, recalls flying around Thailand carrying a large pig in his helicopter to teach animal husbandry to farmers who were starving because they were systematically killing off the largest animals in their herds. It is work, he says, that is hard to dramatize.  The Pentagon has strenuously resisted moves to upgrade the status of the units that deal with \"low intensity conflict.\" Members of the Joint Chiefs argued that Congress was trying to create a \"fifth service\" that would cut across traditional lines of military authority. Adm. Poindexter warned that tampering with the president\\'s control over the NSC \"would present potential constitutional problems.\"  Nevertheless, Pentagon spokesmen insist that the military establishment is working as rapidly as possible to comply with the new law, which takes effect April 19. Commanders of U.S. military special operations forces based all over the world were called to Washington in December to plan how they would operate under a single joint command.  \"These units are in great shape,\" insists Mr. Ropka, who is responsible for carrying out the change. \"They know how to do their jobs. It\\'s the central control mechanism that needs improvement.\"  Mr. Ropka, while denying any overall plot against the new office, admits that, relatively speaking, special operations forces don\\'t require much in the way of expensive military hardware. However, he adds, the prospect of larger budgets has already given him a new internal turf battle to deal with: \"It\\'s between the civic-action side and the \\'Rambo\\' side of the house.\"  ---  COVERT COMMAND Components of the new U.S. Special Operations Command: -- Army Special Forces and Rangers. -- Navy Seal units not attached to fleet, commands. -- Air Force special-operations forces including specially equipped helicopter, transport and gunship units. -- Special-warfare schools of all three services.

       " 'WSJ870317-0048': 'To Benefit From Any Banking Shakeout --- By Cheah Cheng Hye Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. doesn\\'t intend to let the stresses and strains of international banking slow it down.  Even though Hongkong Bank is already the biggest foreign bank in half a dozen countries -- including the U.S., where it has assets of $23.49 billion -- the men who run it want it to get even bigger so it can withstand the shocks reverberating through the international banking system.  They say they are determined to keep enough cash on hand to seize opportunities that arise and to satisfy toughening capital requirements in many countries.  They see a storm ahead for world banking and want to be able to \"pick up the pieces cheaply, if the pieces fall out,\" says Chairman William Purves.  Mr. Purves says last week\\'s decision to ask shareholders to put up the equivalent of $423 million for new shares is aimed at enabling Hongkong Bank to carry out its growth strategy. Shareholders who doubt the wisdom of the move ought to look at the recent experience of the big U.S. banks, he suggests.  \"There are no secrets with regard to the rights issue,\" he said in an interview. \"I want to continue to be able to grow, and without adequate capital, I cannot.  \"I look at the U.S. banks for the last two or three years, and they haven\\'t grown at all. How they can be happy with that, I don\\'t know.\"  John Gray, the bank\\'s executive director for finance, believes the actions it\\'s taking will help carry it through a coming world shortage of capital.  \"As banking regulators tighten up on capital adequacy, you will have a situation in which all the banks will be scrambling around for capital,\" Mr. Gray says. \"It\\'s better if you raise this capital before you actually need it, so that you can react to opportunities as they occur.\"  Mr. Purves, who took over as chairman from Sir Michael Sandberg in December, predicted tough times ahead for international banks -- especially for U.S. banks.  In the U.S., he said, \"there are farm-loan problems that haven\\'t been dealt with. There are continuing problems with the energy sectors, and with the savings and loans associations. And the people who are backing these things, the federal agencies. . . .have no money.\"  On top of that, he said, the Latin American debt crisis is casting a shadow over the big U.S. and Japanese banks, as well as a few big British banks.  \"In this atmosphere of uncertainty, it\\'s terribly important to be strong,\" he said. \"We always have a policy of keeping our capital and liquidity ratios high.\"  Hongkong Bank has vaulted into the ranks of the world\\'s top 30 banks today from its position as No. 75 in the late 1970s. But its resources have been stretched by the aggressive expansion -- including the 1980 purchase of a majority stake in Marine Midland Banks Inc. of the U.S.  Last year, Mr. Purves says, Hongkong Bank\\'s assets expanded much faster than its capital for the first time in years -- by about 30% compared with 18%. Thus, its so-called capital-adequacy ratio, which measures capital against loans and other assets, has declined at a time when many countries are setting stricter capital requirements.  The latest rights issue, Mr. Purves says, is \"`partly to take care\" of recent asset growth, but \"mainly to take care of 1987 and the forseeable future, meaning the next three to four years, and the opportunities that will present themselves for increased lending.\"  He said the 30% asset growth last year -- attributable in part to the takeover of the Bank of British Columbia in Canada -- won\\'t be repeated this year. \"That would be too rapid,\" he said.  While the additional capital being raised should allow continued lending growth, it is unclear whether it will be enough to support another major acquisition. The bank has long stated that it intends to buy a European bank to complete its global network.  Mr. Purves reacted cautiously when asked if more capital will be needed to finance such a takeover. \"Not necessarily so,\" he replied. \"It depends on what we buy and how much it costs.\" He added that Hongkong Bank has yet to identify a European bank for takeover or merger.  Until the latest rights issue, bank officials were slow to admit they needed capital. But in recent years, bad-debt provisions have slowed the bank\\'s earnings growth, limiting the funds that can be set aside to expand the capital base. In 1981-1986, profits grew by 7.6% a year, well behind annual asset growth of 18.5%.  It turned to borrowing, raising capital totaling $1.2 billion in 1985 and 1986 with perpetual floating-rate notes. British and Hong Kong regulators treat such borrowings as part of a bank\\'s capital.  But since then there has been a glut of such notes. So the bank is turning to its shareholders for cash for only the third time in its 122-year history.  Mr. Purves said that \"we certainly wouldn\\'t do a rights issue in 1988 or 1989. That would be crazy, it would make for unhappy shareholders.\" ',\n",

CooperVision, an eye-care company, said it holds 1,420,500 LaserSonics common shares, all purchased Jan. 28 through last Thursday for $1.9375 to $2.05 each.  According to the filing, CooperVision acquired its Cooper LaserSonics stock for investment purposes. Though it may continue to buy Cooper LaserSonics shares, CooperVision said in the filing, it currently intends to limit any additional purchases so its total holdings remain less than 10% of Cooper LaserSonics\\' stock outstanding.  Both CooperVision and Cooper LaserSonics were spun off several years ago from Cooper Laboratories Inc. Cooper Laboratories\\' former chairman and president, Parker G. Montgomery, is chairman of both the spinoff companies. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0046': 'To Block Reebok From Buying Firm --- By Linda M. Watkins Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX) </IN> Two Avia Group International Inc. shareholders filed a class-action suit seeking to block Reebok International Ltd.\\'s planned $180 million acquisition of Avia.  The holders, Clem Eischen of Portland, Ore., and Robert Withers, of Woodburn, Ore., filed their suit in Oregon state court. They charge that Avia, several of its directors, major investors, Reebok and others with breaching their fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs claim Avia is being sold \"at less than its fair market value.\"  Avia agreed to be acquired by Reebok for $16.35 a share. Avia had been planning a public offering at $11 to $14 a share before Reebok\\'s offer. Yet, some holders of Avia stock had purchased their shares at a much higher price and the stock had been trading as high as $28 in thin over-the-counter trading.  Both companies make athletic footwear. Reebok is based in Canton, Mass., and Avia in Portland, Ore.  The plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the defendants from moving forward with the acquisition plan, or a judgment in their favor that will result in an unspecified amount in damages.  \"We just felt the (Avia) officers and directors hadn\\'t acted responsibly in their duties in handling shareholders\\' money,\" said Mr. Eischen, who claims to own 500 Avia shares, some of which he purchased at $19 and others at $21. \"It\\'s a good deal for them but not for the shareholders,\" he said. Mr. Withers, who claims to be a beneficial owner of 954 Avia shares, couldn\\'t be reached for comment.  Steven Wynne, Avia\\'s outside counsel, said, \"The company intends to vigorously defend themselves against the lawsuit and I think the company is confident that in the end they\\'ll prevail.\" Avia has said that it approves of Reebok\\'s offer because the price of its own few publicly traded shares isn\\'t an accurate reflection of the company\\'s value. John Douglas, Reebok\\'s general counsel, added: \"We think the suit is without merit . . . and that the price is good for Reebok and shareholders of Avia.\" Reebok intends to proceed with its merger plans. \"The chances of an injunction being granted are remote,\" Mr. Douglas said.  In the suit, the plaintiffs also charge that Avia and the other defendants discriminated against them \"by destroying the market for their stock and reducing the market price of their stock to a level far below the prevailing market price that was in effect,\" before Reebok announced its offer. They also charge Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. and Montgomery Securities with \"conspiring\" with the Avia defendants. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, a unit of Merrill Lynch, and Montgomery Securities would have been the lead underwriters for Avia\\'s public offering.  \"We vigorously deny what we believe to be frivolous allegations,\" said William Clark, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch. Montgomery Securities\\' general counsel said he expects the suit \"to be dismissed.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0045': 'As Broker-Dealers After SEC Approval --- By Bruce Ingersoll and George Anders Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Two of arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky\\'s investment partnerships withdrew as registered broker-dealers after receiving Securities and Exchange Commission approval.  The accelerated pullout allowed Seemala Partners L.P. and IFB Managing Partnership L.P. to avoid waiting until the end of a 60-day review period. The withdrawal, which took effect Thursday, was an important step in winding down Mr. Boesky\\'s financial affairs under his insider-trading settlement with the government last November.  The SEC\\'s approval permits Seemala Partners to repay $660 million in subordinated debt, plus accrued interest, to Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co. L.P., which in turn will repay certain noteholders, according to SEC officials. In return, the noteholders have agreed not to press any claims for pre-payment penalties and additional interest payments totaling more than $116 million on the early retirement of the notes. One noteholder said yesterday that he had received his funds Friday.  After paying off the noteholders, Seemala said it will still have about $278 million remaining to satisfy potential claims on its assets, according to SEC officials.  Seemala\\'s speeded-up withdrawal had been opposed by the Philadelphia law firm of Berger &amp; Montague. The firm filed a class-action suit against Seemala and other entities under Mr. Boesky\\'s control to recoup the missed profits of investors who traded in the same takeover stocks as Mr. Boesky.  Berger &amp; Montague argued that its clients wouldn\\'t have time to obtain a judgment against Seemala before the noteholders are repaid. The noteholders include insurance companies and thrifts.  The law firm also objected to any \"precipitous\" distribution of Seemala\\'s assets to its limited partners.  Under a plan devised by the Boston law firm of Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart, acting on behalf of Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co., a special reserve of at least $50 million would be set aside to satisfy claims until Feb. 28, 1988. Berger &amp; Montague contended that the reserve would be inadequate and that the entire $278 million instead should be held in escrow.  The SEC approved Seemala\\'s accelerated withdrawal after Choate Hall agreed to three conditions:  --Seemala and Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co. won\\'t distribute any funds to their limited partners for one year.  --Each partnership will require its limited partners to pay their pro-rata share of any judgment won by claimants in the Delaware courts.  --Seemala and the Boesky partnership will hire an accounting firm to audit their assets and liabilities within six months.  The accelerated withdrawal of IFB Managing Partners, which doesn\\'t have any significant assets, wasn\\'t contested, SEC officials said.  Under the insider-trading settlement last November, Mr. Boesky also agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count and to pay $100 million in penalties and in returned illicit profits.  In Boston, Robert Gargill, a Choate Hill partner, said the SEC\\'s action \"is good news for the partnership.\" Federal officials \"are moving forward in a rational way\" to sort out the Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co. affairs, he added.  Mr. Gargill said that it is premature to estimate the amount the fund\\'s approximately 40 limited partners will get once the noteholders are paid. But sources familiar with the partnership estimated that the limited partners would lose 10% to 30% of their initial investment.  The Boesky partnership started business in March 1986 with nearly $1 billion in capital. Seemala acted as its broker. About $330 million of the capital came from the limited partners, the largest of which was Guinness PLC, a British beer, liquor and food company, which provided $100 million. Most other limited partners, including U.S. and British pension funds and wealthy individuals, each invested $10 million or less. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0044': ' In Reagan Defense of Weinberger, Shultz --- By Jane Mayer and Ellen Hume Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) CONGRESS (CNG) </IN> Barely two weeks into the honeymoon, new White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker already is confronting fractious infighting within the Reagan administration and Republican circles.  The internal White House problems erupted over Saturday\\'s radio address, in which President Reagan absolved Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz of criticisms lodged against them by the Tower Commission.  White House insiders said the speech was steered through by National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci after Mr. Weinberger personally complained to the president about the Tower Commission\\'s criticisms of him and after Mr. Shultz publicly quarreled with the panel\\'s findings about his role.  Republican congressional leaders privately fumed after learning last week of the intended speech, which originally planned not only to absolve Messrs. Weinberger and Shultz, but also to denounce the Tower board\\'s criticisms, even though President Reagan had fully accepted them only 10 days before in an attempt to make a fresh start. Mr. Baker, who disagreed with this approach, made a last-minute fight to tone down the speech.  Some leading Republicans investigating the Iran-Contra affair, including Senate select committee member William Cohen (R., Maine) and committee Vice Chairman Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), also complained to the White House and succeeded in getting the speech watered down somewhat. But they still weren\\'t happy. Asked yesterday what he thought of the president\\'s radio address, Sen. Rudman answered: \"Not very much, frankly.\"  Other pressures are mounting on Mr. Baker as well. He faces several difficult personnel appointments, the most crucial being the next head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Since William Webster\\'s nomination to head the Central Intelligence Agency, congressional pressure has been building for two possible candidates for the FBI post: Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini and defeated Michigan gubernatorial candidate William Lucas.  Sen. DeConcini, a strong law-and-order advocate, has the added appeal of being a Democrat, which would help speed confirmation and continue the tradition of the FBI director\\'s being above partisan politics. Mr. Lucas, a black conservative Republican who formerly was Wayne County executive, would help the image of the White House and the Republican Party among black voters.  But Attorney General Edwin Meese apparently has his own ideas on the appointment, and Mr. Baker hasn\\'t yet moved to resolve this growing conflict. A leading favorite of Mr. Meese, Justice Department officials say, is Lowell Jenkins, Mr. Meese\\'s former deputy and now a federal judge in San Francisco. Mr. Baker wants to move swiftly on the matter, White House sources say, but so far Mr. Meese hasn\\'t sent any names over to the White House.  Mr. Baker also faces tough strategy decisions on such critical fronts as the budget for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct 1. Congressional leaders aren\\'t sure how he\\'ll approach the issue. Some expected that the chief of staff, as a veteran legislator and compromiser, would move quickly to hold a budget conference. But recently his aides have suggested that the Democrats should first come up with their own budget plan.  Meanwhile, the White House has been ambiguous on excise taxes and on whether the administration will hold firm to the Gramm-Rudman law\\'s deficit-reduction target of $108 billion for fiscal 1988. White House officials publicly have insisted on meeting the target, but privately have conceded it may slip.  Mr. Baker also faces problems that are more mundane, such as when to hold Mr. Reagan\\'s first news conference since Nov. 19, when the president faltered on several Iran-Contra questions. Aides have suggested that the news conference will be this Thursday. But Mr. Baker\\'s team hasn\\'t yet set a firm date, despite growing press speculation.  What bothered some Republicans most about Saturday\\'s radio address was that it seemed politically inept -- a recent White House problem that Mr. Baker was expected to remedy. \"You just don\\'t reopen this thing,\" said Sen. Rudman, \"because there\\'s always the possibility that when you do . . . people start saying, \\'Just wait a minute, did you mean it this Saturday, or the Saturday before?\\'\"  Mr. Baker and his aides, in a meeting Friday, succeeded in removing the denunciation of the Tower Commission\\'s report from the speech. But they were otherwise less successful, according to a senior White House aide. The episode, some observers suggest, shows that while Mr. Baker brings a keen legislative mind-set to the job, he may face more difficulties as a manager and executive, especially while the president is weakened by the Iran-Contra scandal.  It\\'s too early to judge Mr. Baker\\'s performance, however, and he undoubtedly will be helped when Kenneth Duberstein becomes deputy chief of staff next week. Mr. Duberstein, who headed the White House\\'s congressional liaison office during Mr. Reagan\\'s first term, is expected to handle much of the day-to-day management at the White House.  Mr. Baker already has scored some triumphs. He has improved White House relations with Capitol Hill on most issues and, surprisingly, has assuaged some conservative elements. The former Senate marjority leader has long been a nemesis of the Republican right wing, but some conservatives say he has provided more access than did his predecessors, Donald Regan and James Baker.  The new chief of staff is expected to complete his staff reorganization in 10 days. The need to complete this as soon as possible, Republican sources say, was underscored by what some see as an attempt by Mr. Carlucci\\'s newly restructured National Security Council to expand its influence in the White House.  Some politicians who know Mr. Baker\\'s style say he is so determined not to appear to be usurping the president\\'s powers and prerogatives, that he may undercut his own authority in some critical decisions.

       " 'WSJ870317-0043': 'Icahn Is Under Investigation by SEC --- By Laurie P. Cohen and Teri Agins Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AIRLINES (AIR) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN> Trans World Airlines called off its plan to acquire USAir Group Inc. for $52 a share, saying it doesn\\'t intend to seek control of the company or to acquire additional stock \"at this time.\"  In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, TWA said it plans to amend an application it has pending with the Department of Transportation seeking control of USAir. TWA said it will ask the DOT to allow the company to retain its 14.8% interest in USAir. TWA said it is also seeking \"the flexibility of increasing its holdings to up to 25%\" of USAir\\'s common stock.  Some Wall Street traders and stock analysts interpreted the filing by TWA and its chairman, Carl C. Icahn, as a ploy to pressure Washington-based USAir into buying back TWA\\'s stake in the company at a premium.  Mr. Icahn also confirmed in the filing that the SEC has issued a formal order of investigation into whether he violated securities laws in connection with his stock-buying activities. As previously reported, the SEC is investigating Mr. Icahn\\'s activities as part of a widening government probe growing out of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal. That investigation is not believed to involve the USAir stake.  In his filing, Mr. Icahn disclosed new details of the SEC investigation into his activities. According to the filing, the order was issued last Nov. 12 and empowers the SEC staff \"to conduct a private investigation to determine whether any persons (including Carl C. Icahn) have engaged in certain acts\" in violation of securities laws \"in connection with the acquisition of more than 5% of the shares of certain unspecified issuers and the disposition of such shares.\"  The Nov. 12 date is two days before the government announced that Mr. Boesky had agreed to settle insider-trading charges for a record $100 million and to plead guilty to a felony charge. The timing of the SEC order, as well as the appearance of Mr. Icahn\\'s name on subpoenas issued at the time of the Boesky announcement, indicates that the probe of Mr. Icahn\\'s activities is closely tied to disclosures made by Mr. Boesky to the government.  As previously reported, the government is investigating at least two transactions in which Mr. Icahn was involved. One is Mr. Icahn\\'s proposed bid for Philips Petroleum Co. in 1985. The government is also investigating an undisclosed stake that Mr. Icahn held in Gulf &amp; Western Inc., according to persons familiar with the investigation.  TWA\\'s filing appears to clear the way for USAir to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc. for $69 a share, or $1.59 billion. USAir has already begun a tender offer for Piedmont, and USAir now can likely proceed with the acquisition without further interference from TWA or Mr. Icahn. The USAir-Piedmont agreement was reached less than a week after TWA proposed to buy USAir for $1.6 billion.  TWA had said last week that it was \"reassessing\" its pursuit of USAir. As previously reported, a federal judge in Pittsburgh extended until March 23 a temporary restraining order barring TWA from buying additional USAir shares.  In yesterday\\'s filing, TWA said that, subject to the outcome of the court hearing and the approval of the Transportation Department, it may buy more USAir shares. TWA also said that while it doesn\\'t presently intend to do so, it reserves \"the right to dispose of some or all of\" its USAir shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Mark A. Buckstein, senior vice president and general counsel of TWA, declined to elaborate on the filing or to comment on whether TWA would seek to sell its shares back to USAir.  The filing indicates that New York-based TWA bought most of its USAir stake between February 26 and March 6 at prices ranging from $43.25 a share to $50.25 a share. The company paid an average of $44.09 a share for each of its 4,043,200 USAir shares.  In New York Stock exchange composite trading, USAir closed at $45.25, down $1, as 306,200 shares changed hands.  While USAir is still trading slightly above the average price that TWA bought its shares at, USAir pays an annual dividend of only 12 cents on its common stock. This means that when the cost of financing TWA\\'s holdings of USAir stock is taken into account, TWA isn\\'t currently making a profit on the stock position, a Wall Street source familiar with TWA\\'s holding said.  Sources familiar with USAir and its agreement with Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Piedmont said that while USAir is eager to eliminate TWA as a major shareholder, it could be difficult for the company to buy back TWA\\'s USAir shares.  To complete its acquisition of Piedmont and its previously reported purchase of San Diego-based Pacific Southwest Airlines, USAir plans to borrow about $2 billion. Once the financing is completed, a source close to the company said, it will be difficult for USAir to pay a premium for Mr. Icahn\\'s stake because USAir\\'s lenders will probably want the company to use any available cash \"to pay back debt and not to pay off Carl.\"  USAir retains a strong balance sheet, however, and sources close to the company have recently acknowledged that they would consider studying \"any option Mr. Icahn offers,\" including repurchasing TWA\\'s stake in USAir.  Wall Street sources familiar with Mr. Icahn and USAir also say they don\\'t believe that TWA is likely to renew its bid for USAir. After USAir\\'s purchase of Piedmont is completed, buying the company could cost more than $4 billion. Moreover, sources close to Mr. Icahn say he is more interested in selling TWA than in buying another airline. Mr. Icahn still owns an 11.4% stake in USX Corp, a steelmaker. ',\n",

The group is led by Alfred Lerner, a banking and real estate executive with holdings here and in Baltimore. He is chairman of Equitable Bancorp., a Baltimore bank holding company, and Realty ReFund Trust, Cleveland, a real estate investment trust specializing in refinancing established commercial buildings. A unit of Progressive Corp., a Beachwood, Ohio, insurance holding company, is the limited partner in the group.  AmeriTrust has been the subject of takeover speculation for several years, but there has been no publicly known effort to gain control. It would make a handsome acquisition for an out-of-state bank seeking to enter the Ohio market because of its longstanding relationships with major companies based in this area, according to executives at other banks.  In addition, AmeriTrust is one of the country\\'s strongest capitalized banks, with a shareholder equity-to-assets ratio of 7.48%.  Mr. Lerner said he has filed with the Federal Reserve Bank here for permission to buy as much as 24.9% of AmeriTrust stock, but he declined to say whether the group intends to make a takeover bid.  \"If and when we get there (to the 24.9%), I\\'ll decide about going beyond that,\" Mr. Lerner said. \"I\\'m not dealing with that question now.\"  The purchasing group is required to notify the Fed before buying 10% or more of the stock of the bank holding company.  According to a 13D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group holds two million shares bought for $81.1 million. The stake includes 1.4 million shares bought between Jan. 9 and March 3 for $38.625 to $41 each, the filing said.  AmeriTrust shares closed yesterday at $46.125, up $3.125, in national over-the-counter trading.  Mr. Lerner said he accumulated the stake \"for investment purposes\" because AmeriTrust stock has been \"trading at an attractive price.\" He said he began buying the stock last September.  AmeriTrust issued a statement saying that the investors \"have no hostile intent toward AmeriTrust.\" But executives couldn\\'t be reached for further comment.  AmeriTrust\\'s lead bank, AmeriTrust Co., long has been the establishment bank here. For years AmeriTrust was Ohio\\'s largest bank, but it was eclipsed by several holding companies that were more aggressive in making acquisitions.  Jeffrey L. Cohn, bank analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that while AmeriTrust was slow to expand in a major way outside the Cleveland area, it last year bought Eagle Savings Association, a 23-branch thrift in Cincinnati and converted it to a commercial bank with assets of about $1 billion. In addition, AmeriTrust last year bought a group of Indiana banks with assets totaling about $2 billion. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0040': ' Of Firm\\'s Claims, Urges More Studies Be Made --- By Jacob M. Schlesinger Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) </IN> Upjohn Co. won an important victory in its push to market an anti-baldness lotion in the U.S., as a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee unanimously recommended that the drug get regulatory clearance.  But the five-member panel of outside medical experts, whose recommendation is not binding on the FDA, expressed skepticism about Upjohn\\'s claims for the extent of the drug\\'s effectiveness. It also suggested careful monitoring of the Kalamazoo, Mich., pharmaceutical company\\'s marketing and labeling of the product.  The advisory group also said that while the drug, minoxidil, has been found to have relatively few adverse side effects, further studies should be done once the drug is in widespread use. As previously reported, one FDA staff review similarly suggested that additional studies be made.  Ever since Upjohn first said it was working on the drug, which would be sold under the name Rogaine, its shares have jumped sharply on any news indicating possible approval. But in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn fell to as low as $129 and closed at $135.25, down $3.50.  Analysts said that the stock price before yesterday\\'s hearing already reflected the expected committee recommendation, and that the drop reflected the unanticipated reservations of the panel. \"The expectations in the market were probably for better efficacy data,\" said Joseph Riccardo of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. \"Those expectations will probably have to be cut back somewhat.\"  Most analysts who attended the hearing said, however, they still are enthusiastic about the potential benefits of minoxidil for Upjohn.  The FDA still must approve the drug before it can be sold in the U.S. But one agency official who attended the meeting said that while the FDA has overturned advisory recommendations in the past, it is \"highly infrequent.\" He said the agency probably would reach a decision in the next few \"weeks to months.\"  The hair treatment already has been cleared for sale in 13 countries. The prescription lotion went on sale in Canada in October and was sold to about 24,500 patients by mid-February, an Upjohn official said at the meeting. Minoxidil already is used orally in the U.S. to fight hypertension.  In a statement, Upjohn said it was pleased with the committee recommendation. A spokesman said after the hearing that the committee questions weren\\'t unusual in the drug-approval process and that the company didn\\'t view the discussion as a challenge to its general presentation of the drug.  Dr. Richard De Villez, an Upjohn researcher, told the committee and the gathering of more than 200 securities analysts and other observers that a company study of 1,833 patients using Rogaine found that 40% had \"moderate to dense\" hair growth after a year of use. He added that the solution would be more effective for \"younger men who have been balding for a shorter period.\"  But several members of the committee questioned Upjohn\\'s definition of satisfactory growth. Dr. Robert S. Stern, a dermatologist from Beth Israel Hospital in Boston who chaired the hearing, said that \"there are a variety of ways of presenting the data.\" He said he read Upjohn\\'s numbers to mean that the success rate would \"be more in the range of 20%.\"  He also criticized the company for discontinuing its comparable testing of a placebo drug four months into the study, making it difficult to discern how much of the new growth witnessed actually came from Rogaine. In addition, he said that the effectiveness probably would be less when the drug is in general use, where the company has less control over who uses the drug and how.  Dr. De Villez acknowledged under questioning that it could take as long as eight months before patients knew whether the drug worked for them, and that even at its best it never would cure baldness near the forehead.  \"My main concern is, I don\\'t know what to tell the patient,\" said a committee member, Dr. Paul R. Bergstrasser, a dermatology professor at the University of Texas. \"I don\\'t know whether he might be the lucky one in seven.\"  Committee members also said the drug can be costly and has to be used indefinitely for new hair to stay. They made their recommended approval contingent on \"changes in the labeling that reflect the concerns of the committee.\"  Last May, an FDA official accused Upjohn of exaggerating Rogaine\\'s effectiveness in a company news release. Upjohn denied the charges.  In considering safety questions at yesterday\\'s hearing, the advisory panel decided that \"the benefits outweigh the risks\" in general. But it added that men more than 50 years old and any patients with a history of cardiovascular problems should use caution when using Rogaine. The earlier FDA staff study found that the chief side effect from the drug was skin reactions, such as rashes. There also were incidents of chest pains and heart palpitations, among other things, but a former FDA official, who directed that study, has said that those incidents \"most likely\" weren\\'t due to Rogaine.  Dr. Stern said that people already are grinding up minoxidil in its pill form and using it to promote hair growth. Therefore, he said, even though some safety questions remain, formal approval of Rogaine would let the agency better control the drug\\'s use. ',\n",

The Dallas bank requested the funds last Thursday to make good on FSLIC guarantees on loans made by the bank to struggling savings and loan institutions. Earlier this month, government auditors declared the FSLIC insolvent, and auditors examining the Dallas bank's 1986 financial statement warned they could issue a qualified opinion unless the bank obtained funds for the guarantees.

Some 30-year issues fell about a quarter of a point, or around $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, after hovering in a tight range all day. Corporate and municipal bond prices also slipped.  \"The Treasury market is absolutely dead in the water,\" said Richard H. Suttmeier, a managing director of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. \"There isn\\'t even a breeze blowing to get it moving. This is one of the quietest periods I\\'ve seen in years.\"  A Salomon Brothers Inc. report confirms this view. \"By some measures, bond market volatility has now fallen to its lowest levels since the mid-1970s,\" according to the report in Salomon\\'s \"Comments on Credit\" publication. \"The diminishing volatility of interest rates probably reflects a strong and growing consensus regarding the economic outlook.\" The report added that \"few observers\" expect any \"major shift\" in economic activity \"for the near term.\"  Many corporate executives also expect interest rates to remain stable. \"I think they probably are going to stay about where they are,\" said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of Mead Corp. Mr. Roberts, who also is chairman of the American Paper Institute, added that rates \"perhaps may go down a little but not a great deal.\"  The bond market has been listless since the end of last year. Since then, there have been only three days on which prices of 30-year Treasury bonds have swung more than one point in either direction. The most recent was Feb. 5, when some Treasury issues surged 1 1/8 points.  An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 2.68 points to close at 1425.09. It ranged between 1424.38 and 1428.01.  The Treasury\\'s 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell to a price of 99 25/32 from 100 Friday. The yield rose to 7.52% from 7.50%. The government\\'s 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 100 10/32 from 100 14/32 Friday, as the yield increased to 7.20% from 7.18%.  Rates on short-term Treasury bills yesterday rose from Friday\\'s closing levels. But rates on new Treasury bills, sold yesterday by the government at its regular weekly auction, declined from the previous week\\'s auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills sold yesterday fell to 5.58% from 5.63% at last week\\'s sale, while the average rate on new 26-week Treasury bills slipped to 5.58% from 5.59%.  The South Carolina Public Service Authority offered about $192.7 million of revenue bonds. The issue was priced after auction to yield from 3.25% in 1987 to 7% in 2021, according to Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The unsold balance among the underwriters late yesterday was about $67.5 million. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. and single-A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor\\'s Corp.  Separately, underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers priced an offering by the Western Minnesota Municipal Power Agency. Yields on the issue of $175 million of refunding bonds range from 4.25% on bonds due 1989 to 7.06% on bonds due 2013. The bonds are rated single-A by Moody\\'s and single-A-minus by S&amp;P.  Underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. priced an offering of about $163 million of refunding bonds by the Suffolk County, N.Y., Southwest Sewer District. Yields ranged from 3.60% on bonds due 1988 to 6.50% on bonds due 2007 and 2008.  Separately, underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. priced an issue of about $100.9 million of revenue bonds by the New York Energy Research and Development Authority for Consolidated Edison Co. The 7 1/8% bonds, due in 35 years, were priced at par.

       " 'WSJ870317-0032': 'Many Traders Become Spectators As Stocks Decline in Slow Session --- By Beatrice E. Garcia</HL> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN> Jitters about this Friday\\'s triple-witching hour, exacerbated by a state pension fund\\'s early sell program, kept many investors on the sidelines yesterday, and stock prices moved lower in slow trading.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 20 points in the first hour of trading, but pared its losses in the final hour to close at 2248.44, down 10.22 points.  The weakness was broad, with 1,041 issues losing ground on the New York Stock Exchange and only 550 advancing. The Big Board\\'s composite index fell 0.97 to 164.34, and Standard &amp; Poor\\'s 500-stock index slid 1.66 to 288.23.  Concern about extremely wide price swings this week before the Friday expiration of all March stock-index futures and options contracts, as well as fear of a correction after this year\\'s strong rally, is keeping many investors out of the stock market right now, traders said.  Trading activity slowed to 134.9 million shares from 150.9 million Friday. Yesterday was the slowest session since Jan. 2, when 91.8 million shares changed hands on the Big Board.  Some traders attributed the early weakness to a $57 million sell program from the state of New Jersey, which is divesting the shares of all companies dealing with South Africa. The state pension fund sold such blue-chip issues as Du Pont, Ford Motor, General Motors, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Mobil, PepsiCo, and Pfizer. Last week, the state fund sold $70 million of stock.  New Jersey\\'s sell program alone wasn\\'t large enough to start a rout in the stock market. But as one trader said, \"Especially on a slow day, (a sell program) like that can put a damper on the market.\"  After four consecutive losing sessions, many on Wall Street say the stock market has begun a correction. A pause or even a modest slide in prices wouldn\\'t be terribly surprising because stock prices don\\'t move up in straight lines and they have already gained more than 19% since the beginning of the new year, traders noted.  Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New York, said he expects neither a big slide in stock prices nor a sudden surge. For the next month or so, he expects the stock market to \"tread water.\"  Mr. Groveman added that there\\'s enough money in investors\\' hands and high enough expectations on corporate profits to hold the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 2200. But he doesn\\'t see enough fuel to take prices much higher in early April, when purchases by foreign investors could slow as the new quarter gets under way. In addition, the heavy flow of individual retirement account money into the market should end April 15, he noted.  Joseph Barthel, a technical analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer in Philadelphia, is a little less worried about the market\\'s prospects. He noted that investors appear to be nervous about the course of stock prices and are aggressively buying a high number of put options as insurance. A put gives the holder the right to sell a security at a specific price. Also, nearly 33% of investment-letter writers are calling for a correction, the highest level in six months.  These are the kind of sentiment readings normally associated with a market bottom, not a top, Mr. Barthel asserted.  There was little comfort for holders of Upjohn shares. The stock, which has been riding high for nearly two years on the hope that federal drug regulators would approve Upjohn\\'s anti-baldness drug, skidded after news that an advisory panel\\'s recommended approval is qualified. The panel wants patients to be monitored for side effects, such as irregular heartbeats.  Upjohn traded as high as 142 before yesterday\\'s news, but then dropped to 129 1/2. It closed at 135 1/4, down 3 1/2, on volume of more than 1.2 million shares.  David Saks, a drug industry analyst at the New York office of Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy &amp; Gardner, cited investor disappointment over the panel\\'s qualification on the drug, minoxidil. Nevertheless, he said he expects minoxidil to reach the $1 billion annual sales mark in five to 10 years.  Many technology, airline, insurance, auto and bank stocks were losers. Oil stocks did move higher on surprising crude oil and heating oil price gains in the futures market that were tied to new indications of OPEC production restraint. Atlantic Richfield rose 1 1/2 to 75 1/4, Chevron gained 1 1/8 to 53 3/4, Mobil added 3/4 to 46, Amerada Hess moved up 1 1/8 to 30 3/4, and Standard Oil rose 1 1/4 to 61 7/8. But Exxon eased 1/2 to 82 1/8. Purolator Courier eased 3/8 to 36 3/8. An investment group, including Mutual Shares Corp., a New York investment company, said it owns a 5.9% stake in Purolator. Earlier this month Purolator agreed to a $35-a-share leveraged buyout offer from PC Acquisition Inc.  Pacific Lighting rose 1 1/8 to 54 1/4. The company said it plans to seek a buyer for its land development unit. Centel dropped 3 3/4 to 64 1/4. The communication systems concern said it expects results for the first quarter to be below the year-earlier quarter, when it earned $1.11 a share.  Owens-Corning Fiberglas tumbled 3 1/8 to 26 in active trading. The company attributed the weakness in its stock to a Sunday New York Times story that discussed the health effects of fiberglass. The story also mentioned two other manufacturers of fiberglass: Manville, which fell 1/8 to 2 3/4, and Certain-Teed, which dropped 2 3/8 to 36 1/8. Caesars World inched up 1/8 to 29 1/2 on 869,700 shares. The company is exploring a restructuring or selling out to a friendly suitor after rejecting a $28-a-share cash takeover bid from Martin T. Sosnoff. Meanwhile, Mr. Sosnoff said he\\'s still seeking a friendly merger. Harper &amp; Row moved up 2 1/4 to 52 3/8. The book publishing concern\\'s board took no action on two merger proposals at a Friday meeting and appointed a committee of independent directors to study possible alternatives.  Other publishing stocks were generally weaker yesterday. Tribune fell 1 1/4 to 75 5/8. Salomon Brothers reportedly took the stock off its selected buy list. Gannett eased 3/8 to 45 1/2, Knight-Ridder fell 1 1/8 to 53 7/8, Dow Jones dropped 7/8 to 52 1/2, McGraw-Hill declined 1 1/4 to 69 5/8, Times Mirror lost 3/4 to 82 3/4, and MacMillan slipped 1/2 to 56 1/8.

       " 'WSJ870317-0030': 'To Boost U.S. Oil Output</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) CONGRESS (CNG) ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said he has asked congressional tax specialists to prepare a list of possible tax incentives to boost domestic oil production.  \"I think you need more direct incentives for new drillings at the well,\" the Texas Democrat told reporters. He said he had the staffs of the Senate Finance Committee, which he heads, and the Joint Tax Committee, of which he is vice chairman, \"looking at numbers\" for proposals to accomplish that end.  An Energy Department study to be released today concludes that tax breaks are the least costly and most efficient way to stimulate U.S. oil exploration and development. The report lists several options, including a 5% tax credit for drilling and a boost in the oil depletion allowance, which is a deduction based on the value of the oil produced.  Energy Secretary John Herrington briefed Sen. Bentsen and a few other oil-state lawmakers on the study yesterday. The study, as expected, states that the cost of oil import fees would exceed their benefits for the economy as a whole.  Sen. Bentsen suggested the sale of offshore leases and the sale of oil from federal lands in Alaska to pay for incentives to boost domestic oil production. Both ideas are likely to be controversial, though Sen. Bentsen called them \"very plausible options.\" Asked if a gasoline tax was another option, he replied, \"At this point, I\\'m not ready to say that.\" ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870317-0029': 'In Step That Could Limit Their Growth --- By Michel McQueen Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> The Federal National Mortgage Association won\\'t buy home equity loans, said Chairman David Maxwell. The decision could stunt the growth of these increasingly popular loans.  Mr. Maxwell, who announced the decision yesterday at a meeting of Fannie Mae\\'s outside advisory group, said: \"We don\\'t believe that our provision of liquidity is needed in this segment of the market.\"  In explaining his decision, Mr. Maxwell noted that Fannie Mae was established to increase the supply and lower the cost of mortgage credit. \"Fannie Mae\\'s first responsibility is to provide low, moderate and middle-income borrowers with an adequate supply of affordable housing funds for first mortgages and standard types of second mortgages,\" he said.  Others said the decision was made because home equity lines are too close to consumer credit and thus aren\\'t Fannie Mae\\'s responsibility.  Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored corporation founded in 1938, operates a huge secondary market for conventional and government-insured mortgage loans, buying loans and repackaging some of them into securities. Thus, lenders are able to initiate new loans. Last year, Fannie Mae bought $30.8 billion of all types of mortgages.  Fannie Mae\\'s closest competitor in the secondary mortgage market, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., also hasn\\'t any plans to purchase home equity lines in 1987, a spokeswoman said. Freddie Mac, which purchases only conventional loans, currently buys second mortgages with fixed interest rates.  Home equity loans allow homeowners to obtain credit backed by the equity in their homes, often with less effort than conventional refinancing and at lower rates than consumer credit. The new federal tax law has spurred home equity loans because it reduced the deductions for interest payments except for home loans.  According to the American Bankers Association, home equity credit is expected to double this year from $40 billion outstanding last year. Second mortgages as a total market have also grown to $200 billion last year from $17 billion in 1980, bankers association officials said.  Home equity lines of credit usually are revolving credit lines with adjustable interest rates; traditional second mortgages have either adjustable or fixed rates. Fannie Mae has purchased traditional second mortgages since 1981 under authority granted by Congress; lawmakers are likely to renew that authority when it expires Sept. 30.  \"It\\'s a significant blow, even though we\\'re talking more about the future,\" said Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Banking Association, a trade group of 700 retail bankers, thrifts and credit unions. \"Right now there is no significant secondary market for home equity lines, and many bankers were looking to see what developed.\"  Other industry analysts predicted that Fannie Mae\\'s decision to stay out of the market won\\'t reduce the availability of the home equity lines but will maintain the current diversity in the market.  \"Consumers are still going to see a boutique market with a lot of different programs by a lot of different lenders,\" said Peter Knight, a senior vice president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a thrift industry group. Mr. Knight said that the participation of Fannie Mae and other secondary market participants, often leads to standardization.  Dennis Jacobe, research director for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest thrift industry trade group, called for Fannie Mae to cut back its activities even further by stopping purchases of more traditional second mortgages when its authority to do so expires in September. But the current decision, Mr. Jacobe said, probably would have little effect on the availability of home equity lines. \"There\\'s plenty of money out there,\" he said. ',\n",

About 5,000 barrels a day of Vietnam\\'s Bach Ho, or \"White Tiger,\" crude are currently being pumped at a field, off Vietnam\\'s southern coast, that is controlled jointly by Vietnamese and Soviet state oil companies, the sources said.  Two cargoes of between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels apiece, each less than half the size of shipments normally traded in international markets, are scheduled to be exported during the next month. The oil\\'s quality is roughly similar to Indonesia\\'s medium-weight, low-sulfur Cinta and Sumatra light grades, which are officially priced at $17.10 and $17.56 a barrel.  The marketing of the crude could lead to sales of oil-field gear, pipe and refinery equipment to Vietnam during the next two to three years as the country develops the Bach Ho field and neighboring oil fields.  At least two Japanese companies, C. Itoh &amp; Co. and Nissho Iwai Corp., are involved in what an official at one of the companies described as \"complex\" negotiations over an oil-for-equipment trade.  Two oil companies, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France and the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell Group, are said to be talking with Vietnamese and Soviet officials about refining the crude in Singapore and then selling back to Vietnam some of the resulting petroleum products.

       " 'WSJ870317-0027': 'Plans to Acquire U.S. Chip Maker --- Concern Cites Political Row Over Move to Buy 80% Of Schlumberger Unit --- By Brenton R. Schlender Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN> Fujitsu Ltd. dropped its plans to buy 80% of Schlumberger Ltd.\\'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., citing \"the rising political controversy\" in the U.S. over the transaction.  The proposed transaction, which would have given Fujitsu a stronger foothold to make and sell its semiconductor products in the U.S., had been criticized in recent weeks by various officials in the Reagan administration. Just last week, Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said he would recommend that the administration find a way to block the merger, because it represented the first step toward Japanese domination of the semiconductor industry.  Many government officials also opposed the merger at a time when Japanese semiconductor firms have been accused of dumping computer chips in U.S. markets at prices lower than it cost to make them. U.S. companies say this practice resulted in companies here posting losses of more than $1 billion last year.  Fujitsu\\'s reversal was so sudden it surprised even its own executives in the U.S. \"What can I say,\" said Ken Katashiba, vice president and spokesman of Fujitsu\\'s U.S. semiconductor unit, which would have absorbed Fairchild. \"The decision was made in Tokyo, and we didn\\'t even hear about it until this morning.\"  In Tokyo, Fujitsu declined to comment, saying a statement was being prepared.  Don Brooks, president and chief executive officer of Fairchild, said events unfolded so quickly that nobody at the company would have any comment for at least a day.  Mounting cabinet-level opposition to the $200 million Fujitsu proposal almost certainly was responsible for Fujitsu pulling back.  Sources close to the Commerce Department said the final straw was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger\\'s decision to join Mr. Baldrige in opposing the merger, not because of trade frictions, but for reasons of national security. Analysts estimate that Fairchild last year performed at least $150 million of government contract work on semiconductors, and perhaps a third of that was proprietary work that couldn\\'t be replicated by other companies.  In its short announcement that the merger had been scuttled, Schlumberger said Fairchild\\'s management is considering \"other avenues,\" including the possibility of a leveraged buyout. In the meantime, Schlumberger said Fairchild will continue its existing business within the Schlumberger organization.  Analysts saw that as a signal that Fairchild is up for sale again. The Fujitsu proposal \"set the price tag at $200 (million) to $225 million,\" said Adam Cuhney, a semiconductor industry analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. \"It would be a great deal, and I\\'m sure several companies will look at Fairchild very seriously.\"  Mr. Cuhney mentioned LSI Logic Corp., Milpitas, Calif., as a possible suitor. LSI is headed by Wilfrid Corrigan, whose previous position was president of Fairchild before it was acquired by Schlumberger in 1979. Mr. Corrigan had opposed the merger with Fujitsu because both companies are leaders in the fast-growing market for gate arrays, a kind of programmable chip that performs specific mathematical or logical functions. LSI also makes gate arrays.  Late last week, neither Fujitsu nor the Japanese government showed any signs of wavering on the issue of acquiring Fairchild. A Japanese Embassy spokesman said that governments ought to stay out of the matter, and a Fujitsu spokesman said the company wouldn\\'t let emotional trade issues frustrate it into dropping its offer.  At Fairchild, however, frustration already had boiled over last week because of the long wait for approval of the merger. Fairchild employees had started passing around a petition soliciting support to file a lawsuit to stop the U.S. government from meddling further in the transaction.  Schlumberger is a New York-based oil-field services and electronics concern that is controlled by French interests.  In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Schlumberger shares closed at $37.375, down 25 cents. ',\n",

Ministry officials said they were encouraged by the yen's recent stability and by expectations that the Japanese currency won't rise sharply this year, in contrast to its rapid gains in 1986.

Among those making recent acquisition bids are USAir, Chrysler, Harcourt Brace, Dart Group and Martin Sosnoff, despite predictions that Jan. 1 tax changes would slow down mergers. Rising stock prices are forcing bidders to offer more for their targets than in 1986.  Acquirers are in a hurry because they fear legislators might clamp down on mergers, investment bankers say. \"There\\'s a sense that this window won\\'t be open very long,\" says David Kay of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Some investors like Mr. Sosnoff, whose bid for Caesars World has been rebuffed, say they\\'re stepping forward because interest rates might soon rise, boosting acquisition costs.  Bidders are throwing big numbers around, judging by commonly used measures. USAir\\'s $69-a-share bid for Piedmont Aviation represents 83 cents for every $1 of Piedmont\\'s revenue, says Tim Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. In 1986, USAir paid 50 cents per $1 of PS Group\\'s revenue. AMR paid 70 cents per $1 of AirCal\\'s revenue.  Dart Group\\'s initial $41.75-a-share offer for Supermarkets General represents 3.5 times the food chain\\'s book value, says Robert Raiff, a C.J. Lawrence analyst. In 1986, the average tab for food chains was 2.5 times book.  Jack Kent Cooke has agreed to pay almost $1,800 a subscriber for McCaw Communications\\' cable assets, says Barry Kaplan of Goldman Sachs, compared with an average price of roughly $1,500 a subscriber in 1986.  Takeovers started slowly in 1987. Salomon Brothers counted $14.9 billion of pending and completed mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the first two months. There were $21.3 billion such transactions in December 1986. But the recent flurry of deals could put first-quarter 1987 totals on a par with the 1986 first quarter, Salomon says.  Last year, some pundits predicted takeovers would fall 50% in 1987 and acquisition prices, 10% to 15%. Many acquirers face higher taxes and less cash flow because they can no longer mark up the value of certain assets tax-free before depreciating or selling them. Acquirers in 1987 also benefit much less from an acquired company\\'s tax benefits.  In 1986, says Robert Willens, a Peat Marwick Mitchell accountant, an acquirer could have placed market values on Harper &amp; Row Publishers\\' intangible assets such as contracts with authors, depreciating the higher asset values without paying up-front taxes. Harcourt and Theodore Cross are bidding for Harper.  A buyer of Caesars World could have sold some of its land at market prices without paying taxes. And Chrysler could have used American Motors\\' tax-loss carry-forwards to offset much larger amounts of taxable profit than this year, Mr. Willens says.  It might make sense for some acquirers to pay up despite the loss of many tax benefits. Some book publishers\\' and casino companies\\' earnings prospects are improving. All acquisitions are cheaper to finance than in 1986. Currently, \"acquirers are looking at a blended financing rate\" on bank loans and junk bonds of 12% or less, down from 13.5% a year ago, says C.J. Lawrence\\'s Mr. Raiff.  Most mergers aren\\'t driven by tax benefits, investment bankers add. There\\'s only one U.S. auto maker Chrysler could buy to add more vehicles and distribution. Airlines that don\\'t want to be crushed by giant Texas Air or AMR have to merge. Media concerns that want to grow must scramble for the few major cable systems or television stations available. CBS issued $400 million of bonds Friday, saying it might buy TV stations.  \"It\\'s a seller\\'s market,\" says Goldman\\'s Mr. Kaplan.  Shares of some rumored takeover targets languished yesterday in a weak market. But analysts foresee more acquisitions. They say future airline targets could include Alaska Air, Midway Airlines and even UAL, which has Donald Trump as a big investor.  Meanwhile, there\\'s revived speculative interest in supermarket chains like Albertson\\'s and Kroger as well as in Southland, a convenience-store chain. The bids for Harper have sparked interest in Macmillan and other publishers.  Some traders think active investors like Mr. Trump, Mr. Sosnoff and Dart just want to attract higher bids by friendly companies. Rising stock prices and tax changes, among other things, may make it less advantageous for raiders to force asset-rich companies like UAL to sell major operations to buy back stock, they say.  In 1986, raiders prompted Holiday and others like TW Services\\' predecessor Transworld to break themselves up. But the tax status of such liquidations is cloudy and they might be less profitable. A 1987 liquidation of Lear Siegler -- recently taken private by Forstmann Little -- would have yielded at least 25% less than in 1986, according to earlier estimates by investment bankers.  Liquidations and leveraged buyouts \"that depend on asset sales\" seem to have fallen off, says Charles Nathan, a Salomon merger specialist. Instead of \"finding an asset-rich company and splitting it up,\" adds Dan Lee, a Drexel analyst, more people will buy good businesses and try to run them better than former managers. ',\n",

ICN currently has about 19.8 million shares outstanding. An additional 12.3 million shares are reserved for issuance under terms of various warrants, options and convertible debt securities of ICN.  ICN said the increase \"is essential\" to obtain additional financing; to take advantage of future business opportunities, \"such as acquisitions\"; and to make shares available for stock splits and dividends and to attract and retain \"able personnel.\"  Previously, ICN\\'s chairman, Milan Panic, has said the company wants to raise more than $800 million by the end of this year to take over a large drug company. In the past, ICN has acquired more than 40 companies, paying largely with its own shares.

The continuing poor trade performance suggested that Brazil may be hard pressed to reach its target of an $8 billion surplus for this year. Last year, the country's surplus totaled $9.5 billion.

       " 'WSJ870317-0019': '</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN> A federal safety agency said thousands of Ford Motor Co. vans converted into ambulances might have to be recalled because of reported fuel spurting and fires.  Philip Davis, director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\\'s office of defects investigation, said, \"I believe that the number of reported failures may indicate a safety problem that warrants a recall.\"  Mr. Davis\\'s comments were in a letter sent last month to Ford and three dozen manufacturers that convert Ford E-350 vans into ambulances. The letter was released by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group based here. The traffic-safety administration is an arm of the Transportation Department.  The traffic-safety agency has received 283 complaints about the vans. Typically, the incidents, which have resulted in 14 fires and two injuries, involve fuel spurting from the filler necks of vans with dual gasoline tanks.  The agency previously said it was probing 1984-86 Ford Econoline vans converted into ambulances, or about 3,200 vehicles. But Mr. Davis\\'s letter mentions 1980-86 models, suggesting that the probe is being expanded to bring an additional 4,000 vehicles under study, according to the Center for Auto Safety.  Mr. Davis\\'s comments don\\'t constitute a recall order from the agency. He emphasized in the letter that he hadn\\'t reached a firm conclusion about the van\\'s alleged problem. Nevertheless, his letter bolsters the contention of some that the vans should be modified to prevent injuries to emergency personnel and gas-station attendants -- and that Ford should make the modifications.  The traffic-safety agency\\'s probe into the vans began last spring, after two ambulances in Virginia caught fire, prompting the state to issue a nationwide warning about the vehicles. The International Association of Fire Chiefs and the Center for Auto Safety have urged the federal safety agency to order a recall of the ambulances.  The consumer group also wants the agency to order a recall of some 320,000 1984-1986 Ford Econoline vans -- E-150s, E-250s and E-350s -- that haven\\'t been converted to ambulances. Robert Dewey, a spokesman for the group, said the center has received 17 complaints about fuel spurting from the vans. The incidents have caused 10 fires and three burns, he said.  The safety agency hasn\\'t taken action on the group\\'s petition.  In Dearborn, Mich., John P. King, service engineering manager, Ford Parts and Service division, said, \"The Center for Auto Safety is simply mistaken in its assertions about Econolines not involved in ambulance service. Ford Motor Co. engineers have been working intensively with ambulance manufacturers to help them identify, eliminate and present conditions contributing to excessive fuel system pressure in emergency vehicles. This includes the development of hardware that will make these vehicles more tolerant of excessively volatile fuels and extreme operating conditions.\"  --- Ford Recalling 33,600 Cars DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 33,600 1987 model Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Cars to correct a condition that could lead to reduced steering control.  The auto maker said the vehicles, which are equipped with 5.0-liter engines, may have been produced with improperly made steering linkage parts that could fracture.  About 32,000 of the cars are in the U.S., 1,200 cars are in Canada and an additional 400 were exported to other countries, Ford said. The company also said it isn\\'t aware of any injuries or accidents resulting from the defect. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0017': '</HL> Four years ago, Martin Sorrell went on the road to try to sell U.S. investors on a little-known British advertising company named Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC.  Mr. Sorrell, then Saatchi\\'s finance director, \"laid out Saatchi\\'s goals to be No. 1 around the world,\" recalls Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim &amp; Co. \"Everybody laughed. It was like, \\'the nerve of this man!\\'\"  But no one is laughing now. London-based Saatchi -- under the auspices of brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi, as well as Mr. Sorrell -- did indeed become the world\\'s largest advertising group, when it acquired Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. for $450 million last spring. Mr. Sorrell, meanwhile, fled the fold to launch his own marketing conglomerate, called WPP Group PLC. His admittedly ambitious goal: to become the world leader in non-traditional marketing areas, such as sales promotion, design and sales incentives. No U.S. company has yet put together a conglomerate of that type. All those disciplines currently are growing much faster than traditional advertising.  \"We want to be No. 1 in size and quality in all those areas,\" Mr. Sorrell says. His time frame? \"Yesterday.\"  In the almost two years that he has been involved in WPP, it has amassed a mishmash of small British and U.S. marketing companies, ranging from graphics to real estate advertising. That modest collection isn\\'t much of a threat to anybody yet. But \"if the past is prologue, he will become a major player,\" says Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer of Backer &amp; Spielvogel Inc., a Saatchi unit.  Mr. Sorrell\\'s dreams of world-wide dominance in the field \"aren\\'t going to happen overnight, but certainly I think he can do it,\" adds British securities analyst Richard Sanderson of Panmure Gordon &amp; Co., London. \"The growth so far has been phenomenal.\"  The financial community\\'s infatuation with Mr. Sorrell is so strong that at times it seems almost blind. WPP\\'s stock, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, has traded above 60 times 1986 earnings, and is currently trading at about 30 times 1987 earnings. \"If God went public at 60 times earnings, I\\'d have a problem with it,\" says Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. Some analysts concede that because Mr. Sorrell proved them wrong while he was at Saatchi, they don\\'t want to cry wolf again.  But even some admirers question whether Mr. Sorrell can bring any cohesion to WPP\\'s disparate group of companies. \"I\\'m sure he has some plan of attack, but I can\\'t figure it out,\" notes Michael Wahl, chairman and chief executive of Saatchi unit Marlboro Marketing Inc.  Also, some analysts worry that WPP\\'s success is too dependent on making a constant stream of acquisitions. WPP acquires firms with small down-payments, awarding future payments in cash and stock if certain earnings targets are met. One ill-fated acquisition could deflate the share price and therefore make it harder to make further acquisitions with stock. \"The risk is that something blows up in his face and that\\'s reflected in the share price. Then he doesn\\'t have the financing to go forward,\" says James Dougherty, an analyst with County Securities USA.  Mr. Sorrell brushes off those criticisms, most of which he heard in his days at Saatchi. \"We try to identify sectors that are growing by at least 20% per annum\" outside of acquisitions, he says. And Mr. Sanderson of Panmure Gordon says the 20% growth rate is \"probably quite a conservative forecast for these companies,\" which are involved in package design and sales promotions, among other things.  In the U.S., traditional advertising, such as television commercials and magazine advertising, grew 7.7% last year and is expected to grow an additional 7.6% this year, according to McCann-Erickson Inc.  So far, most of WPP\\'s activity has been in Britain, where the press has dubbed Mr. Sorrell the \"third Saatchi.\" Now, however, Mr. Sorrell is turning his attention toward the U.S. Yesterday, he announced that WPP acquired two U.S. marketing firms for a combined value of as much as $30 million. Sidjakov, Berman, Gomez &amp; Partners is a San Francisco corporate identity and packaging design company. Walker Group/CNI is a New York and Los Angeles retail design firm.  Mr. Sorrell, a youthful-looking 42-year-old Briton educated at Cambridge and Harvard Business School, left Saatchi just a year ago. He and British stockbroker Preston Rabl had purchased a 30% stake in WPP the previous May for about $750,000. At the time, it was called Wire &amp; Plastic Products PLC, and it made wire shopping carts. But under the guidance of Messrs. Sorrell and Rabl and managers they brought in, it has since purchased 15 communications companies, four of which are in the U.S.  WPP\\'s stock price has soared, with total market capitalization now over $150 million. It announced yesterday that 1987 net income more than quadrupled to $1.7 million. Most of that growth came from acquisitions. Saatchi itself holds about a 7% stake in the company. Mr. Sorrell\\'s 8.5% personal stake, which he purchased for about $600,000, is valued at about $13.5 million. \"That\\'s not bad for 1 1/2 years\\' work,\" says Andrew Wallach, an analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.

In the suit filed in state court here, TransAmerican, the successor to GHR Energy Corp., seeks $1 billion in actual damages and $1 billion in punitive damages from Coastal, an oil and gas producer and marketer.  TransAmerican, a major natural gas producer, is headed by John R. Stanley, who amassed $1 billion of debt before seeking Chapter 11 protection from creditors\\' lawsuits under the federal Bankruptcy Code in 1983. In addition to one of the largest natural gas operations in Texas, closely held GHR operated a huge refinery in Louisiana that has been idle since the company made the bankruptcy-law filing, allowing it to work out a plan to repay its debts.  TransAmerican alleges in the suit that Coastal has been trying since last year to acquire TransAmerican\\'s enormous natural gas reserves in south Texas by disrupting its efforts to reorganize its affairs. Most recently, the suit charges, Coastal last month attempted to insinuate itself into the bankruptcy-law case through a reorganization plan under which Coastal would acquire TransAmerican\\'s assets.  TransAmerican also charges that Coastal is trying to persuade TransAmerican\\'s creditors to drop a reorganization proposal awaiting court approval. Coastal, the suit claims, wants to \"strip TransAmerican of its assets for substantially less than the fair market value\" as part of a \"thinly veiled attempt to control a larger share of the natural-gas market.\"  Coastal last night confirmed that it was interested in buying TransAmerican assets as part of the bankruptcy case. Coastal said it was a TransAmerican creditor -- in an unsecured amount believed to total about $700,000 -- which gives the company standing to propose its own plan of reorganization for the company.  Coastal didn\\'t comment on TransAmerican\\'s allegations, except to say that it regarded the suit \"as an attempt to usurp the jurisdiction of the U.S. bankruptcy court.\" To that end, Coastal said, a bankruptcy court in Houston scheduled a hearing for today on a motion by Coastal to restrain TransAmerican\\'s recently filed suit from going forward.  TransAmerican claims that because of Coastal\\'s efforts to seize control through a reorganization plan, at least one of TransAmerican\\'s creditors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., now is \"reevaluating\" its \"contractual commitments\" to TransAmerican. Other company creditors include the Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co. unit of Continental Illinois Corp. of Chicago, the Banque Paribas unit of Cie. Financiere de Paribas of France, and the Chase Manhattan Bank unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., New York.  Last fall, TransAmerican said, it filed a reorganization plan that called for secured creditors to grant debt relief valued at more than $200 million in exchange for a commitment by TransAmerican to pay its remaining debts over a 10-year period.  TransAmerican, which previously had punctuated its bankruptcy-law proceedings by filing suits against its banks, said in its latest suit that Coastal and its chairman, Oscar S. Wyatt, were \"notorious corporate raiders\" who had attempted to create a \"stranglehold\" over natural gas markets.  Coastal is no stranger to courtrooms and natural gas controversies. In the 1970s, the company was accused of reneging on natural gas supply contracts and was exposed to more than $1 billion in legal claims, which it eventually settled. And recently, Coastal won a $549 million judgment from an Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit in a suit charging that the unit tried to monopolize certain natural gas markets. ',\n",

The Sunnyvale, Calif., concern called the 32-bit complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, its \"most significant\" product introduction this decade. Advanced Micro said the new chip \"will bring the kind of performance to desktop applications that previously was possible only through mainframes or super-minicomputers.\"  But chip-industry analysts cautioned that while the new device is a step in the right direction for Advanced Micro, it may be coming too late. Other major U.S. chip producers, such as Intel Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., already have switched a higher proportion of their operations to CMOS-based chip technology than Advanced Micro has. It also remains to be seen whether Advanced Micro will be able to convert its fabrication facilities quickly and efficiently enough to compete.  Advanced Micro posted a $17.7 million loss for the third quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with a $20.3 million deficit a year earlier. In the year-earlier quarter, a $9.5 million tax credit made the net loss $10.7 million. Sales for the quarter rose 4.2% to $150.2 million from $144.1 million.  CMOS technology has been one of the fundamental chip developments in recent years and has driven the increasing sophistication of computer hardware.  Advanced Micro said it may see some revenue from its new chip, the Am29000, at the end of fiscal 1988, but the company doesn\\'t expect the new device to generate significant new revenue until fiscal 1989. After that, the company anticipates a market for the chip of at least $100 million to $200 million annually.  But analysts question whether Advanced Micro, which currently garners less than 8% of its revenue from CMOS-based chips, will be able to persuade customers to base their computer designs around the new device. Producing CMOS chips is a difficult technological task, critics say, one that Advanced Micro already is late in tackling.  \"Companies are going to have be convinced (that Advanced Micro) can produce CMOS,\" said Adam Cuhney, vice president, research, for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. \"If the company still needs another year to get this chip into production, is it the product or process that\\'s causing the problems?\"  By contrast, more than 35% of Intel\\'s revenue was from CMOS-based chips last year, according to Mr. Cuhney, a figure that is expected to rise to about 50% this year.

In proxy material, the grocery-store chain said it expects holders to receive one Hancock share for every three Lucky shares. Lucky also said it expects that Hancock will pay a quarterly dividend of about 10 cents, starting in the second quarter of the fiscal year that began Feb. 2. Lucky said, however, that no such dividend has been declared, and the payout will be at the discretion of Hancock\\'s board.  As reported, the Hancock spinoff will be the final step in Lucky\\'s restructuring, in which it is shedding all non-grocery operations to thwart the takeover efforts of Asher B. Edelman. The New York investor recently agreed to a three-year standstill agreement, restricting his holdings to less than 5% in both Lucky and Hancock.  No date has been set for the distribution. A Lucky spokesman said the spinoff probably will occur in May, and the company expects the move to be tax-free to holders.  Hancock will apply for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Lucky said. The fabric unit initially will have about 12,821,000 common shares outstanding, Lucky said, based on the parent\\'s 38,463,772 shares outstanding at Feb. 20. A total of 80 million Hancock common shares will be authorized; five million preferred shares also will be authorized, although none will be issued.  Hancock, based in Tupelo, Miss., operates 325 fabric stores in 29 states. In fiscal 1987, Hancock earned $23.5 million on sales of $289.9 million, Lucky said. After adjustment for certain interest income and other items, Hancock\\'s pro forma earnings were $19.4 million, or $1.52 a share.  Hancock\\'s assets at Feb. 1 totaled $220.7 million. After adjustments associated with the divestiture, the former unit\\'s pro forma assets will be $150.8 million.  Lucky intends to retain the unit\\'s $69.9 million in cash and equivalents; a spokesman noted that the cash accrued while the grocery chain owned Hancock. In addition, Hancock will acquire $29.5 million in long-term debt and $5 million in short-term debt before the spinoff. Lucky will retain the funds, but the new company will repay the debt. Hancock will go public with an initial capitalization of about 30% debt and 70% equity, which Lucky described as a \"normal and appropriate capital structure for a company with its profitability and cash flow.\" ',\n",

Stevens Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX) </IN> The dollar fell sharply Monday, continuing a decline that began last week, as speculators probed for possible central-bank support of the U.S. currency.  The dollar\\'s recent slide is the result of its inability to rise above certain resistance levels against other major currencies, traders said.  \"We couldn\\'t take it higher, so now we\\'re coming off,\" said Paul O. Steinborn, senior financial markets adviser at BankAmerica International in New York.  Rumors and threats of intervention by major central banks, which have helped keep market participants from driving the dollar outside a narrow trading range, have followed the agreement to stabilize exchange rates struck Feb. 22 by the six major Western industrial nations, or group of six.  The group -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- didn\\'t specify a range for the dollar that they considered acceptable, leaving traders to guess.  \"The question now is, \\'What are our limits?\\'\" said William G. Orsini, corporate foreign exchange manager at Bank of Montreal in New York. \"At this point the market is trying to find where the bottom range is, where the central banks will come in,\" he said.  In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8340 marks, down 1% from 1.8520 Friday. The decline may have been exaggerated by the relatively low volume of trading, dealers said. The U.S. unit fell 0.6% to 151.55 Japanese yen, from 152.41. The British pound climbed 0.7% to $1.5870, from $1.5760.  In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar remained unchanged against the Japanese currency at 151.55 yen, even with the New York close Monday afternoon.  Many traders believe the group of six, or G-6, intend to enforce a trading zone for the dollar between 1.80 marks on the low end and 1.90 marks on the top -- a range that hasn\\'t been breached in weeks. Although the dollar is generally expected to drift lower, a breakout from its recent range isn\\'t expected any time soon.  \"I think we\\'ll stay within the range that we\\'ve seen since G-6,\" said Jack A. Kessler, vice president of foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.  The British pound continued to ease against its European counterparts as a result of selling to take profits on sterling\\'s rise over the past two weeks. Against the mark, the pound slipped to 2.9106, from 2.9188.  After the current round of profit-taking, some traders say, the pound should rebound based on the attractiveness of relatively high British interest rates and a strengthening economy -- which prompted sterling\\'s earlier rise. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s over, just taking a breather,\" said Bank of Montreal\\'s Mr. Orsini, referring to the pound\\'s initial run-up.  The pound also has benefited from buoyant expectations surrounding the British budget, which the government is due to release today. The budget is believed to include a tax cut and a reduced need for government borrowing.

       " 'WSJ870317-0004': '--- Company Says Holders Shouldn\\'t Worry About Lack of Acquisitions --- By James Tanner Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> PETROLEUM (PET) </IN> Lawrence G. Rawl, new chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Corp., spots a visitor admiring John D. Rockefeller\\'s roll-top desk outside the company\\'s executive dining room. \"That may be up for sale next,\" he says.  He jests, of course. But while the founder\\'s desk seems safe on display on the 53rd floor of Exxon\\'s Manhattan tower, the building itself was recently purchased by a Japanese company.  In many ways, the oil giant that uses a tiger to promote its gasoline but is often described as an elephant is smaller than it used to be. It recently sold its electric-motor and nuclear businesses. Oil-refining capacity has been cut 1.5 million barrels a day, more than the operating ability of many oil companies. Capital and exploration spending is down 40% from 1985. The world-wide staff has been reduced to 102,000 employees from the 1981 peak of 182,000. \"The elephant,\" says Mr. Rawl, \"is a lot slimmer.\"  The downsizing has accomplished pretty well what the company set out to do, according to Mr. Rawl and Lee R. Raymond, the new president, in their first interview since assuming their posts Jan. 1. It has made Exxon more efficient in areas of the oil business where the company can get the highest returns and the highest profit margins. But it has raised concerns among shareholders and industry analysts about how the company is investing its large cash flow at a time when some of its bigger competitors appear to be more aggressive in acquisitions and in exploring for new oil fields.  The shrinking may be over. No further asset sales are pending at the moment, the Exxon officers suggest, though Mr. Raymond says the company eventually may close two more refineries, including one in France. \"We used to be the world\\'s greatest seller of heavy fuel oil,\" he says, \"but I don\\'t get a lot of fun out of selling fuel oil and not making any money.\"  Despite the shrinking, Exxon remains the world\\'s largest and most prestigious oil company. It operates in more than 80 countries, and its revenue -- $76.2 billion last year -- approaches the value of all oil sold by the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. No other corporation matches its profits -- $5.36 billion in 1986, despite last year\\'s oil-price collapse. Its projected cash flow -- $10 billion to $11 billion this year -- exceeds that of many governments.  Size and enormous cash flow have buffered Exxon from devastation in the oil industry, where many of its debt-loaded competitors struggle daily just to survive. Yet, some industry executives and analysts question whether Exxon may be growing stagnant. The takeover-minded T. Boone Pickens Jr. of Mesa Petroleum Co. says that like many other American oil companies, \"Exxon is liquidating.\" An oil company is assumed to be in liquidation when it isn\\'t replacing reserves as fast as it is using them up.  \"Why hasn\\'t it made a successful pass at another big company?\" asks one retired Exxon executive. \"The perception is that Exxon is being liquidated by not doing exploration and by not buying properties.\"  Exxon\\'s officers say such complaints don\\'t take into account the narrowing of profit margins or dilution of earnings if the company got into a bidding race for oil properties or plowed yet more money into exploration. \"If you are talking to explorers, to geologists, they shoot craps,\" says Mr. Rawl. \"They don\\'t worry about the bottom line.\" But, he asks, \"How . . . can you spend $7 billion a year and be liquidating?\" Though down sharply from 1985, Exxon\\'s capital and exploration expenditures exceeded $7.2 billion in 1986. This year, $6.5 billion is budgeted.  \"We\\'ve taken a lot of heat since we reduced our capital and exploration expenditures,\" says Mr. Rawl. \"The fact is, though, that we still spend more in this country and foreign than any other non-government oil company.\"  The Exxon officers say, nonetheless, that the company was more than just a bystander in the industry\\'s big mergers and probably would have made a major acquisition if the bidding hadn\\'t gotten so spirited. \"We looked at them all,\" says Mr. Raymond, \"but we had in mind a pretty firm standard of what was attractive and what wasn\\'t.\" Adds Mr. Rawl: \"We didn\\'t think they (the takeover targets) were good deals at a high oil-price forecast. As it turned out, though, the price didn\\'t stay high, and therefore we were lucky.\"  Also, he says, many bidders were in much more need of oil reserves than Exxon. \"We were coming from a very strong resource base, trying to compete with people who were not sure where their next development well was coming from,\" he says. \"They were willing to bet the farm, and we weren\\'t.\"  Exxon has made a lot of acquisitions of smaller properties, though the pace slowed last year after oil prices fell. But the plunge in above-ground prices didn\\'t result in as many depressed sales of oil reserves as might have been expected. Banks that held such reserves as collateral for loans to oil companies wouldn\\'t permit sales until they were repaid. Also, most holders of oil properties felt that the price of petroleum would rebound, and their asking prices remained relatively high.  Unlike many oil companies, Exxon didn\\'t have big write-downs on its reserves last year. Its proven oil and gas reserves held remarkably stable, in fact -- down only marginally at year-end 1986 to 15.1 billion barrels, as measured in the oil equivalent, from 15.4 billion barrels a year earlier. Mr. Rawl notes Exxon also has 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels of probable and \"static\" reserves -- discoveries that aren\\'t currently being developed because of transportation, economic or technology reasons. \"We\\'ve got as much out there in the bank as we have in the pipeline,\" he says.  This comfortable reserves position is a major reason Exxon officials say they don\\'t worry about what to do with their cash flow. \"If you take the kind of static resources we have,\" says Mr. Raymond, \"I don\\'t think there\\'s going to be a problem in terms of lack of opportunities.\"  Exxon\\'s outlook was and remains that the real value of hydrocarbons will rise substantially over time and its strategy is to make the right long-term investments.  While not predicting, the Exxon officials say their planning is based on the price remaining flat -- around $15 a barrel in 1986 dollars -- for several years and then rising faster than inflation. \"One day we are going to wake up, and the price will be up\" significantly, says Mr. Raymond. \"The technical answer in our planning basis is that the \\'knee\\' in the curve is in 1990 plus or minus two years.\" Exxon will be one of the few companies \"in a position to \\'lever up\\' with an increase in price -- both in its near-term earnings impact and its longer-range investment opportunities.\"  Company officials say Exxon still seeks \"suitably priced\" oil properties but is conservative in the search. That is for antitrust and other reasons, but chiefly because they believe they have other options for their investments, such as the future development of their own static resources. Also, they note the company has acquired more than 500 million barrels of reserves, on an oil-equivalent basis, over the past three years. Total price paid was $1.4 billion, acquiring for Exxon oil in the ground at an average cost of $2.82 a barrel.  Mr. Rawl doesn\\'t rule out further big acquisitions, such as the $500 million purchase in 1985 of a 49% stake in Hunt Oil Co.\\'s interest in a production-sharing agreement with the Yemen Arab Republic, including the prolific Alif oil field. But he insists the company isn\\'t helping shareholders if it substantially boosts assets only to get a modest earnings increase.  Even as it shops for properties, however, Exxon has spent several times as much buying back 18% of its own stock. Since the repurchases began in 1983, Exxon has acquired 153.7 million shares for $7 billion -- far exceeding the $5 billion four-year buyback recently announced by General Motors Corp. Exxon paid an average price of $46 a share; in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Exxon closed at $82.125, down 50 cents.  Despite some criticism by analysts that Exxon should be putting its cash to better use, Mr. Rawl says that by buying back shares Exxon \"acquired\" oil in the ground -- its own reserves -- cheaper than it can find new oil fields or buy petroleum properties from others. The cost of repurchasing shares so far means that, in effect, they are buying oil at $2.42 a barrel, which \"is a lot better than spending $7, $8 or $9 a barrel looking for it,\" says Mr. Rawl. The figure is arrived at by dividing shares into the company\\'s proven reserves.  Mr. Rawl cites other buyback benefits as well. Earnings are spread across fewer shares. In 1986, while Exxon\\'s total net income was up 10% to $5.36 billion, per-share earnings rose 15% to $7.42 because of fewer shares outstanding. Though \"modest\" share repurchases continue on a month-to-month basis, company officials say they don\\'t necessarily think this the best investment they can make. \"Sound development investments are obviously better,\" says Jack F. Bennett, senior vice president and chief financial officer. \"We are always on the prowl for those.\" ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870317-0002': 'Expected to Bolster Profits at Networks --- Accord Totals $1.43 Billion; ESPN\\'s 13-Game Portion Is Gamble for Cable Firm --- By Peter W. Barnes and Hal Lancaster Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL> TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN> The National Football League\\'s new $1.43 billion television contract is expected to help bolster network profits, but it is a gamble for ESPN Inc.  The NFL said it has approved a new three-year contract with CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. for rights to air NFL games. The NFL also agreed to sell rights for 13 games to ESPN, a 24-hour cable sports programming service that is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC.  Overall, the new package reduces rights fees to the NFL by about 3%, to about $476 million annually, from about $490 million in 1986, the final year of a five-year, $2.1 billion contract with the networks.  The networks had been seeking a reduction in fees in the face of a soft advertising market for sports programs and declining viewership of games. Last year, the networks had losses totaling about $75 million on broadcasts of NFL games, though they made a slight profit on the overall five-year package, industry sources said.  Network executives hope the transaction will be a benchmark in future negotiations for other sports rights fees, including major league baseball, which is currently in the middle of a six-year contract.  Kenneth D. Schanzer, executive vice president at NBC Sports, said the NFL\\'s willingness to reduce fees \"is significant beyond measure because it augurs a new climate in the sports television marketplace. The NFL has historically been the bell cow.\"  Under the contract, CBS will continue to broadcast Sunday games, though its rights fees will fall more than 6% from the last year of the previous agreement to about $150 million annually. NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, also will continue to air Sunday games, but sources say its fee was cut more than 10% to about $120 million annually because of weaker viewership of its package.  ABC will pay about $115 million each year -- about flat from a year earlier on a per-game basis -- for 16 \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts, but it dropped five \"special\" games that were aired under the old contract. ESPN bought rights for eight regular-season Sunday night games, four exhibition games and the Pro Bowl for about $50 million a year, sources said.  The NFL considered bids from several cable concerns as it sought to make up the revenue it expected to lose from the networks. \"This is the toe in the water for cable with the NFL,\" acknowledged one network executive who asked not to be identified. \"The league -- as it looks ahead long-term, like all other sports leagues -- thinks cable is where it is at.\"  But the transaction is a gamble for ESPN, which currently reaches 41 million homes through about 4,000 cable systems. ESPN hopes to cover the cost of the contract through advertising revenue and increased subscriber fees, which are paid by cable system operators. But it will have to compete for viewers against network prime-time programming.  Roger Werner, executive vice president of ESPN, said the increase in the current subscriber fee of 27 cents a month would be \"substantially less than 20 cents per subscriber per month.\" If the charge was 10 cents a month for all 41 million homes, for example, the resulting $49.2 million a year would come close to covering ESPN\\'s rights payments.  ESPN is expecting a rating of nine to 10 for its NFL games, more than double the ratings of its college football broadcasts. One rating point equals 874,000 homes with televisions.  Mr. Werner said he assumes advertising rates on ESPN\\'s NFL broadcasts will be slightly less than for comparable network games, but those rates will still be the highest ever for cable telecasts. The highest advertising rate ESPN has charged was $12,000 to $14,000 per 30 seconds on its Saturday night college football broadcasts. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0176': 'A Corporate Raider\\'s Rx for Big Business --- By Tim Metz</HL> Is T. Boone Pickens Jr. getting ready for another mega-deal?  Some of his closest observers on Wall Street think so, and Mr. Pickens\\'s new autobiography, \"Boone\" (Houghton Mifflin, 293 pages, $18.95), does nothing to dissuade anyone from that view. In the epilogue of the book, Mr. Pickens quotes a Wall Street analyst answering a Journal reporter\\'s question about what Mr. Pickens might do with the cash and borrowing power (currently about $1.25 billion) of Mesa Limited Partnership, which Mr. Pickens runs: \"What do you think Boone will do with that much money?\" the analyst counters, rhetorically.  \"He {implied} we were going to do something,\" Mr. Pickens writes. \"But that something might be different. I have always believed that it\\'s important to show a new look periodically. Predictability can lead to failure.\" Especially in book publishing.  Predictability is exactly what\\'s wrong with this otherwise craftsmanlike little book, in which Mr. Pickens collaborated with writer Jim Conaway. Too often, \"Boone\" is an annotated amalgam of Mr. Pickens\\'s press clippings, rather than an insightful self-portrait of the capricious crusader of the oil patch, whom corporate managements have come to fear and loathe.  But at least there is no truth-in-packaging problem here. \"Boone\" is what the cover offers, and Boone, Boone, Boone is what the reader gets. Thus:  Boone grows up in Holdenville, Okla., and Amarillo, Texas.  Boone goes to work for Phillips Petroleum Co. but gets frustrated by the waste and bureaucracy there and so leaves to establish what was to grow into Mesa Petroleum Co.  Boone realizes in the late 1970s that it\\'s too costly and uncertain to replace Mesa\\'s oil and gas reserves by exploration and so starts hunting for oil on Wall Street.  Boone terrorizes and topples Cities Service Co. and Gulf Corp., settles with Phillips, backs away from a confrontation with Superior Oil Corp. and is stopped cold by Unocal Corp. (but the Mesa group uses a tax loophole to reap a $90 million profit in defeat).  Boone drops $15,000 on a Super Bowl bet and $3 million in the commodities market while he\\'s off playing in a three-day Canadian golf tournament. (Weep not, Boone fans. He\\'s got $105 million left.)  Occasionally -- all too rarely in fact -- Mr. Pickens pauses for a little reflection. His message is that there are a few things seriously wrong with big business, but they can be put right fairly easily.  What\\'s wrong, in Mr. Pickens\\'s view, is that most of the people who manage America\\'s major public companies don\\'t hold enough stock in them to think like shareholders. Instead, he contends, they build elaborate, wasteful bureaucracies; eschew, rather than manage, risk; treat themselves to Caligulan life styles at shareholders\\' expense; and try to hold on to their perks and power by naysaying and using brute economic force against right thinkers such as Mr. Pickens.  Mr. Pickens backs his critique with some truly delicious examples of management hubris, cowardice and waste. They include oil-exploration kickbacks, $30,000 hunting trips to Spain in a corporate jet, and costly completions of oil wells known to be faulty just so a discovery can be logged.  To this reporter, after a couple of decades of observing corporate managements, the book\\'s diagnosis of the disease infecting a good part of industrial America rings true. But Mr. Pickens\\'s prescription for the ailment doesn\\'t.  His solution, dramatically underscored in his past takeover moves, is to end waste of assets by wresting them away from incompetent or unresponsive managements and turning them back to the shareholders -- through royalty trusts, share repurchases or takeovers.  In the end, no matter which way Mr. Pickens slices it, that\\'s liquidation. And liquidation is both shortsighted and doubly unjust. It\\'s shortsighted because it summarily eliminates the potential long-term shareholder, and, by dismembering corporations, it reduces corporate philanthropy, which is one of the social benefits of large corporations. It\\'s unjust because it may reward rather than punish the bad manager, who may simply unfurl his golden parachute and go his merry way; and because it often snatches jobs away from those rank-and-file employees who already are among the principal victims of mismanagement.  One wonders why a somewhat-less-radical solution than corporate dismemberment mightn\\'t be a wise alternative to Mr. Pickens\\'s proposals. If shareholders can band together to force a sale or restructuring, why couldn\\'t they band together to force managers to take most of their compensation in stock, rather than salary and perks?  Ah, but there\\'s no fast money for shareholders in that; no chance for Mr. Pickens to do well while he does good.  --- Mr. Metz is a news editor for the Journal in New York. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0169': 'The Trouble With High Tech --- By Edwin Wilson</HL> On the night of the first press preview of \"Les Miserables\" the temperature in New York had dropped 50 degrees in 24 hours and stood at a freezing 19 degrees. When the audience arrived at the Broadway Theater, the doors were closed and the small outer lobby was jammed, so that several hundred patrons were forced to stand in the cold for a half-hour. From that perspective, it looked as if les miserables for that performance would be the audience, not the actors safely ensconced inside the heated theater.  Eventually the audience was let inside and producer Cameron Mackintosh appeared on stage to explain that the power source that ran the computer, which in turn controls the turntable on stage, had gone out. It was feared that the show would have to be canceled, but finally, about an hour late, power was restored and the three-hour show began.  With the opening of \"Les Miserables\" last Thursday and of \"Starlight Express\" last night, high tech has arrived on Broadway. It is a mixed blessing, bringing in addition to great advances, the very real risk of mechanical and electronic glitches. \"Starlight Express,\" which has the most complex stage machinery seen on a Broadway stage this century, was postponed two or three times because of technological problems. And the incident with \"Les Miserables\" was not the first: The opening two performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington were canceled because of computer malfunctions.  The high priests of this new technology are director Trevor Nunn, set designer John Napier and lighting designer David Hersey. All three worked on \"Les Miserables\" and \"Starlight Express\" just as they had collaborated four years ago on \"Cats.\" The hallmark of their work is ultrasophisticated stage equipment and subtle, fluid lighting that result in remarkable stage pictures and visual effects.  The set for \"Starlight Express\" does not duplicate the original London set, but has been completely revamped for the stage of the Gershwin Theater. But the show is still about trains, which are played by performers whizzing around on roller skates and dressed in metallic outfits that resemble space suits or ice hockey uniforms. The main plot concerns a mythical race across the U.S. by three locomotives -- an electric, a diesel and a steam.  The floor of Mr. Napier\\'s set is made of molded plastic with sloping curves and inclines over which the skaters glide. The sides and back of the stage are on three levels, and when a race is on (there is a series of trial heats before the final one), the skaters swoop from one level to another over bridges and ramps and around the perimeter of the stage through tunnels and around two islands of audience members seated in front.  The centerpiece of the machinery is an enormous bridge of steel girders above the stage that looks like a Star Wars contraption come down to earth. It descends from the sky, moves toward the audience, turns, pivots, sends out its extremities to become a bridge that skaters can traverse. Meanwhile, Mr. Hersey\\'s lighting blinks, flashes, pulsates and changes colors like shards of a rainbow; at times the stage goes black and thousands of tiny stars shine in the darkness.  The skaters, who are dancers and actors turned skaters, are extraordinary. Before the show opened there were tales of the aches and bruises they suffered learning to skate at high speed, especially on sharp corners and up steep inclines. Their work paid off because they not only skate superbly, they even perform break dancing and difficult acrobatics on skates.  Andrew Lloyd Webber has written a score for the entire piece: songs with lyrics by Richard Stilgoe, and orchestral accompaniments for the races and chases.  So the show has an arresting appearance, and it has plenty of sound, but if you go to \"Starlight Express\" expecting content, you will be disabused of your preconceptions. What attempts there are at telling a story and plumbing emotional depths, or even shallows, are pathetic.  For example, Pearl (Reva Rice) is an observation car torn between \"hooking up\" with the electric or the steam locomotives. In other words, Pearl is part of a romantic triangle. \"She\" even gets to sing an anthropomorphic love song, \"Make Up My Heart.\" This moonsick, crooning rail car and \"her\" dilemma are plain ludicrous.  The only reason to see \"Starlight Express\" is for the skating and for the visual effects, which, though they grow a bit monotonous, are spectacular.  In \"Les Miserables,\" which stars its revolving, computer-guided stage, the new technology allows director Nunn and his co-director John Caird to create outstanding stage pictures, to keep the action moving with cinematic fluidity and to underline emotional climaxes. Though a few changes have been made, the American incarnation of this musicalization of Victor Hugo\\'s novel is essentially the same as the London version.  \"Les Miserables\" has a number of advantages over \"Starlight Express.\" For one thing, thanks to Victor Hugo, it has a story. It also has a pop-opera score by Claude-Michel Schonberg that effectively underscores the emotional climaxes and the stirring call to arms by the revolutionaries who man the barricades. Seeing it again, I still find the character treatment simplistic and the plot overloaded. In the final 30 minutes there are at least four points at which the play should have ended, or that should have been cut in order to move straight to the apotheosis of the hero Valjean (Colm Wilkinson). Particularly superfluous and offensive is the final appearance by the low-life vulgarians Thenardier (Leo Burmester) and his wife (Jennifer Butt), which is intended as comic relief. This is one case where a computer malfunction would have been welcomed: The revolving stage should have spun out of control, sending the characters into the wings. ',\n",

In addition, the two former RCA executives, Richard Miller and Eugene Murphy, will get a total of $2,850,000 next Jan. 1 unless they end their GE employment earlier.

       " 'WSJ870316-0154': 'Olympian Progress in Separating Politics and Sports --- By Kim Un-Yong</HL> When in the 1970s \"ping-pong diplomacy\" first took a brick out of the great wall that then separated Washington and Beijing, it was one of the few times in history that sport and politics had achieved the right mix.  Today, as Pyongyang tries to rally the socialist world against Seoul\\'s playing host to next year\\'s Summer Olympic Games, the South Korean capital is significantly increasing its sports contact with the Eastern bloc and China.  Although Seoul has no diplomatic ties with such countries, it has made marked progress in strengthening academic, trade and, in particular, sporting links. The last, especially since the beginning of 1986, plus some other developments, suggests that Pyongyang may find itself a lonely figure if it carries out its threat to lead a boycott of the 1988 Olympiad.  For one thing, the International Olympic Committee has made it clear it will not accede to the North\\'s demand to host eight Olympic events. Meanwhile, men and women from countries that are North Korea\\'s political allies are regularly competing alongside South Korean athletes both in Seoul and on socialist soil. The significance has encouraged foreign ministry officials in Seoul who hope for substantive progress in relations with socialist states prior to the 1988 Olympiad.  These and other efforts are already achieving results. Just this month, the East German Sports Minister and National Olympic Committee President, Manfred Ewald, and East Germany\\'s IOC member, Guenther Heinz, came here for a six-day visit to view preparations for the Seoul Olympics.  This visit, moreover, followed Sports Minister Ewald\\'s attendance at the January meetings of the executive committee of the Association of National Olympic Committees in Paris at which he said East German athletes \"are preparing now for a great Olympic festival in 1988.\" In short, the beneficial side effects to be derived from increased sports contacts between Korea and other nations -- in particular those with which it has no diplomatic relations -- help fulfill an important aspect of the original Olympic ideal.  Naturally, North-South Korean relations are important. All South Koreans would be delighted if the same enthusiasm many communist countries are showing for the Seoul Olympics were also shown by Pyongyang. In the southern part of the Korean peninsula, the dream remains for reunification. Though the north professes the same, its actions instead seem to edge it toward isolation.  South Korean Sports Minister Lee Sei Kee raised Seoul\\'s level of sports diplomacy in February when he went on a three-nation European tour that included the opening of the Winter Universiad in Czechoslovakia. He also visited Yugoslavia, where he received a written commitment from that country that it will participate in the Seoul Olympiad.  For its part the IOC sees in the 1988 Summer Games a golden opportunity for the Olympic movement to free itself from the cycle of boycotts that began in Montreal in 1976 and continued in Moscow and Los Angeles. Its confidence is evident from its firmness in not bowing to Pyongyang\\'s demand for eight events. Further talks with the unpredictable North Koreans are planned, but IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who met with sports ministers from socialist countries late last year, has already said he is optimistic that nearly all will attend the 1988 Games.  President Samaranch is particularly encouraged by pronouncements such as those by East German leader Erich Honneker, who is leaning toward participation. Mr. Honneker has said as much in meetings with the IOC president and more recently with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who, on an East European tour, joined the pro-Seoul lobby by urging East Bloc attendance at the Olympiad.  The Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary and Poland have announced that their athletes are already preparing for Seoul though without unqualified statements they will attend.  Last year in particular saw considerable strengthening of ties through sport between Seoul and socialist countries, highlighted by the large delegation China sent to September\\'s Asian Games. Significantly, Beijing\\'s official press now refers to last year\\'s Asiad as the \"Seoul Asian Games\"; earlier references omitted mention of the South Korean capital.  Coincidentally, a new era of \"ping-pong diplomacy\" seems to have dawned on Seoul-Beijing relations following thrilling but good-natured clashes between the two in last September\\'s Asian Games and the recent World Table Tennis Championships in New Delhi.  Cuba, which early on indicated support for the North Korean position, has been chosen as host for the 1991 Pan-American Games, making it improbable that it could afford to join a boycott and thus risk a tit-for-tat snubbing three years after the Olympics.  I believe there is an increasing closeness among IOC members, as opposed to the political barriers that have existed in the past, or at least have been perceived to exist. It seems there really is a rekindled and genuine enthusiasm for the Olympics among the vast majority of member nations. That socialist countries will make a stand just to back up one intransigent nation is improbable. A number of encouraging signs support such optimism.  For example, in 1986 a number of East Bloc nations sent teams to international competitions in Seoul, including the first Soviet women\\'s volleyball team to visit the Korean capital. Next month\\'s second World Marathon Cup in Seoul has received entries from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany and Poland, whose runners will join athletes from China in competing on South Korean soil.  At this early date -- the official IOC invitations to the Seoul Olympics will not be sent out until Sept. 17 this year, exactly one year before the start of the Games -- the Soviet Union has raised hopes it will compete by agreeing to send both men\\'s and women\\'s teams to compete in a pre-Olympic hockey event in September this year.  South Korean athletes also have been carrying the sporting friendship message to socialist countries. A 54-member team attended the Feb. 21-28 Winter Universiad in Czechoslovakia, and another team will attend the Summer Universiad in Yugoslavia in July. The Korean-national wrestling team is scheduled for two training stints in Hungary this year and an international tournament in Budapest later this month.  The indications appear to be that, irrespective of what stand North Korea finally takes once the IOC\\'s Sept. 17 deadline has passed, the political factor will largely be transcended by the sporting one. The 1984 Moscow-led boycott of Los Angeles was not altogether welcomed by its allies -- Romania went ahead and participated anyway -- and another is not likely to be popular.  In the final analysis, sports and politics should never mix. The Seoul Olympics will be a sports victory.  --- Mr. Kim is a member of the International Olympic Committee and president of the General Association of International Sports Federations. ',\n",

Apparently the show\\'s producers did too, and so the dog has been riffed -- along with more than 200 producers and reporters who worked for CBS News. My guess is that the loss of Ike Pappas et al. will be felt more sharply than the loss of Daisy, but those are the breaks of the game.  I did see a gentleman who styles himself Hornby K. Fletcher and rents himself out as a nerd. He told Rolland Smith that corporations and private persons employ him to attend celebrations in his color-clashing haberdashery, and he emptied his pockets of Kleenex, calculator, pocket dictionary and street map to show what he could do. It was absolutely side-splitting humor, really; it was all I could do to keep from rolling around on the floor.  Next came Ms. Hartley and Mr. Smith seated on the stairs amid the audience. By chance, no doubt, the steps that they chose gave access to seats occupied by many Girl Scouts from Troup 219, who presented former Girl Scout Hartley with a plaque commemorating the 75th anniversary of the organization. Ms. Hartley desired to know whether \"75th anniversary\" meant 75 years. The Girl Scout presenting the plaque kept a straight face and assured her that it did.  That cleared up, Mark McEwen delivered the national weather news, always a great crowd-pleaser. He continues to use the plastic stick-ums of himself -- in chaise longue and in antique roadster -- to illustrate activities climatically appropriate in selective sections of the country. I realize this is all in good fun, but it\\'s really tedious.  Lynn Redgrave next appeared, seated at the kitchen table. She is half of the lineup of \"Sweet Sue,\" the other half being Mary Tyler Moore. It is now playing on Broadway, after having been roundly panned in its Boston tryout. Ms. Redgrave and Ms. Hartley some time ago did a television epic about lesbians in which they kissed. Without seeing them on \"The Morning Program,\" you would not believe the air time these two women devoted to how they felt about kissing each other. They also discussed Ms. Hartley\\'s attire -- \"very caz,\" said Ms. Redgrave, meaning \"casual,\" I think. They mentioned an earlier studio meeting, which was allegedly precluded from broadcast, in which they discussed \"dogs and flatulence\"; and they talked at length about their kids. Ms. Redgrave said her son is attending a university in Colorado, majoring in \"powder (snow) and women.\" Nice talk. There were yuk-yuks about makeup, and a coarse reference or two to Dolly Parton\\'s chest -- really enlightening.  Ms. Hartley -- affecting an English accent she attributed to her conversation with Ms. Redgrave, who had not overtly manifested one -- then segued to Hollywood reporter Robert Osborne. Mr. Osborne described the American Film Institute festival of foreign films that had commenced the previous night in Los Angeles, and displayed film of notable persons. Bette Davis and Robert Cummings appeared to have been poorly embalmed, but talked anyway.  Then it was back to the kitchen table with Dr. Bob Arnot, the resident physician. He had Dr. Willabald Nagler with him, who has written a book called \"Body Maintenance and Body Repair.\" He sounds like Dr. Ruth Westheimer, only in baritone. His belief is that surgery for back problems is generally not a good idea -- exercise is the ticket.  That done, we went to Bob Saget\\'s \"Name the Baby Contest.\" Faithful readers will recall that Mr. Saget, who has no shame, showed videotapes of his wedding in the first week of the show and made snide remarks about the guests and his wife. Since then, apparently, he has solicited nominations from viewers for a name for his first born, and the winner proposed \"Aubrey Michelle.\" Thrilling stuff.  Next came Rolland Smith\\'s interview with architect Philip C. Johnson, again at the kitchen table. Mr. Johnson, 80 years old, is responsible for many buildings in major cities that look like Atwater Kent radios, but he isn\\'t a bit humble about it. Mr. Smith, nattily attired in corduroy sport coat and maroon turtleneck -- rather a change from his suit-rep-tie-white-shirt debut -- gave the older gentleman free rein for his comments, and Mr. Johnson took off at full gallop. He said Houston is the best American city because he \"built most of it.\" He said \"nine-tenths of our work is for nothing\" because most proposed designs are rejected. He said at first that \"all Americans have no judgment,\" and amended that to: \"All people have no judgment at all.\" He said his ambition is to design a cathedral, a perfectly appalling notion. A cathedral with Palladian windows? Revolting. He expressed his opinion that a nation as rich as this should enable him to build a whole city. He doubted the likelihood of this, perhaps suggesting that Americans do have some judgment after all.  There followed two really stupid segments. Nella Barkley actually makes money counseling people on how to ask for salary increases. She accepted two candidates from the audience who were nearly as confounded as she, and conducted sham interviews with them about wages. Ann Mahony is a handwriting analyst, a science about as exact as psychiatry. She interpreted the scripts of Mr. Smith, Mr. Saget, Ms. Hartley and Mr. McEwen, concluding in substance that Mr. McEwen should be running the show.  I think \"The Morning Program\" should find some work for the dog. But then again, why should it? I\\'m not going to watch it, you\\'re not going to watch it, and why punish the dog?

Biff says a station wagon is out. Too, you know, suburban.  We\\'re not really into cars, Al. After all, it\\'s basic transportation we need. Just getting there is the bottom line.  Yes, something, you know, basic, but with some creature comforts -- a telephone, stereo, radar warning, burglar alarm, lighted vanity mirror -- like Boozie and Bud\\'s Audi.  We need something modest, like in the $30,000 field. Biff wants, naturally, a Mercedes 560 SEL, but I think we should get an American car.  Al, don\\'t raise your voice at me; there\\'s a reason. You know, it\\'s time to really be like Dr. Ferdinand said last night at the Mental Health dinner. We have just got to prioritize our agenda in life.

The announcer urges citizens to stay united during the earthquake emergency.  But some observers fear that the opposite will happen, that in the earthquake\\'s aftermath, ideological differences that already divide Ecuador will widen.  \"The system is really at a test right now,\" says a foreign banker in Quito. He and other observers from industrialized countries applaud much of what the administration has done in the past two years -- particularly a foreign-exchange liberalization undertaken in August. Now he worries the earthquake will give opposition parties an opening to destroy such programs before they can bear fruit.  Just before 9 p.m. on March 5, the ground started shaking in the heavily forested, sparsely populated region in the foothills of the Andes east of Quito, the capital. The ground was soaked from recent rains, and Amazon River tributaries were at high water. At 11 p.m., the earth shook again, and whole sodden mountainsides came crashing down on the farms, oil-pumping stations and villages below.  \"We heard a roar of water,\" says Jorge Elias Verdugo Vera, a young teacher who lived in a house set on stilts with his wife, brother and two children. \"I went out to see what was happening and saw that the water was halfway up the stairs. We ran out and swam away. The water was up to our chests.\"  When Mr. Verdugo went back the next day, the house was gone. \"No furniture. No kitchen. No clothes. No television,\" he says. \"The river took everything.\"  President Leon Febres Cordero estimated the number of dead and missing at 1,000, though other estimates are far higher. The cost of the earthquake to the economy is estimated at more than $1 billion, including the loss of a 26-mile section of Ecuador\\'s main oil pipeline that forced a halt in oil production and export. Ecuador depends on oil for about two-thirds of its hard-currency earnings.  For that reason, the Febres Cordero government announced last week that it wouldn\\'t make any interest or principal payments on its $8.16 billion foreign debt for at least the rest of the year.  In the northeast, where there were rolling green hills there are now only naked cliffs, and where there were mountains are only halves of mountains. Once crystal-clear Amazon tributaries run thick with mud; bridges and homes are kindling wood downstream. Here and there a rusty corrugated-metal rooftop sticks up through the ooze. The smell of cadavers hangs in the air.  In Andean mountain villages to the west, tearful residents patch together their crumbled houses and complain that all the aid is going to the eastern lowlands, where the oil pipeline was. In Quito, where buildings rocked and cracked but didn\\'t collapse, automobile use is restricted and soldiers guard the gas stations.  At Quito\\'s air force base, earthquake victims wait in line for hours to hitch rides on cargo planes to the earthquake zone. They carry food and clothing for family members, and speak bitterly of profiteers who have flown into the region with sugar and rice that they sell at three times the normal price.  On Friday the government announced measures to quell such speculation, and to fund its newly enlarged budget deficit. It imposed price controls on a dozen staple products, while subsidized gasoline prices were raised as much as 80%.  \"This is political dynamite,\" said a senior government economist. But he noted that gasoline subsidies had mainly benefited the richer 20% of the population, the only ones who can afford to own or use motor vehicles. He said he hoped the public would see the gas-price increase as a form of wealth redistribution.  But that seems unlikely. Uneven wealth distribution is a basic problem in Ecuador, where barefoot Indian women sell boiled corn in front of the high-rise central bank, and where men loiter by roadsides in hopes of finding work unloading trucks.  Such working-class people say the new price increases -- whether caused by speculators or by government decrees -- only add to their misery. Conventional wisdom here has it that the government helps big business but does little for anyone else.  The sentiment developed long before the earthquake. Ecuador has a sharp, longstanding ideological split along geographical lines. On the coastal plains, where entrepreneurs have been exporting bananas and cocoa for decades, people tend to put firm faith in free trade. In the Andes, where government breaks to business date back to Spanish-colonial times, people favor state intervention and protectionism.  In the last presidential election, Ecuador voted in Mr. Febres Cordero, a wealthy businessman from the coast. He took office in 1984 and set about imposing coastal free-enterprise principles throughout Ecuador, arguing that private enterprise is the best engine to develop the country. Foreign bankers and Reagan administration officials cheered. Not surprisingly, Andean businessmen and opposition parties rebelled.  \"This country has had a fight for the last two years,\" says a foreign banker. \"It\\'s been like watching a tennis game.\"  Opposition congressmen have accused government technocrats of violating the constitution by negotiating the foreign debt in English, for instance. They have called in debt negotiators to explain why part of the foreign debt is pegged to the U.S. prime rate, and another to the London rate. They impeached the finance minister for overhauling the foreign-exchange markets in August.  The foreign-exchange overhaul was perhaps the most important economic measure this government has taken -- and the most divisive. It floated the local currency, the sucre, against the dollar, and separated private-sector foreign trade from government trade. Since August, private businessmen have been able to import and export as they please, clearing their transactions through private banks at market exchange rates. The government -- which imports some goods, services the foreign debt and exports only oil -- still clears its trade through the central bank at a controlled exchange rate.  The government has said the measure will eventually encourage exports. But nonbeneficiaries argued that it drove down the sucre and fueled inflation. Opposition politicians are challenging the measure\\'s constitutionality.  Now the earthquake promises to fuel the opposition. Because the foreign-trade overhaul left the government handling oil exports and nothing else, the destruction of the pipeline left the government with little hard currency coming in from abroad.  To be sure, proposals already have emerged to soften the blow of lost oil revenues until the pipeline can be repaired. Venezuela, a fellow member with Ecuador in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has not only offered to ship oil to Ecuador to meet domestic demand but also to fulfil some of Ecuador\\'s export quotas. Ecuador would receive hard cash for those Venezuelan exports, to be repaid in oil when the pipeline reopens. Neighbor Colombia has offered to let Ecuador ship some oil through a Colombian pipeline near the border, with Mexico financing the necessary connecting pipeline. All of these arrangements still must be negotiated.  Meanwhile, World Bank officials were in Ecuador last week negotiating a loan to rebuild the main Ecuadorean pipeline, estimated to cost $150 million and take four or five months. And the Inter-American Development Bank may finance road reconstruction.  \"One can paint a not-so-doomsday scenario, depending on what sort of deals they put together,\" the foreign banker said.  Ecuador had alarmed foreign bankers even before the earthquake by missing a payment on its foreign debt. It had restructured the bank portion of its foreign debt in January, 1986, but pressed for a new restructuring when oil prices plunged last year.  Ecuador had requested $380 million in relief from the bank debt. Both sides say they had reached agreement on a $326 million package and were negotiating its form when the earthquake hit. ',\n",

The board of governors of Intelsat, a little-known but powerful satellite communications consortium, named Mr. Burch, currently an influential Washington lawyer, its director general on Friday. Ratification by Intelsat\\'s 113 member nations, scheduled for early April, is considered a formality.  Intelsat currently has a near-monopoly on international satellite telecommunications, but it faces competitive threats from fiber-optic communications and separate, privately owned communications satellites. \"The next big battle over preserving a telecommunications monopoly is coming with Intelsat and Comsat at the center of the controversy,\" predicted Harry Shooshan, a Washington telecommunications consultant.

Mr. Burch, 59 years old, was chairman of the FCC from 1969 to 1974 and adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford. He takes over Intelsat at a time of internal upheaval caused by the dismissal of Richard Colino, director general, and Jose Alegrett, deputy director general.

The Reagan administration is trying to stave off the explosion by urging Japan to consider buying an off-the-shelf U.S. fighter or developing a new plane with McDonnell Douglas Corp. or General Dynamics Corp. \"Obviously, this is a decision that Japan has to make by itself but we believe we have the products that can meet Japan\\'s needs in a cost-effective manner,\" argues Thomas Hubbard, director of the State Department\\'s Office of Japanese Affairs.  Though a decision won\\'t be made until this summer, the Japan Defense Agency leans toward handing the Fighter Support Experimental, or FSX, project entirely to a domestic group headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japanese officials say. National pride as well as the promise of major economic spinoffs from the feat of catching up with the best in U.S. aerospace design make the build-in-Japan option attractive to policy makers in the Japanese defense establishment.  That decision could coincide with a debate over a trade bill that reflects Congress\\'s frustration over the persistently large U.S. trade deficit with Japan. A rebuff of the U.S. offer would be \"like throwing large amounts of gasoline on the already raging fire of protectionism,\" warns Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) of the Senate trade subcommittee.  \"There\\'s no excuse for Japan producing the airplane all by itself, not with a $60 billion trade surplus over the U.S.,\" he adds.  Sen. Danforth has a special interest in the FSX project. The two U.S. bidders are headquartered in his state. But he predicts that the FSX issue could incite other congressmen who would see it as an example of how Japan flaunts even the rules of comparative advantage.  \"The Japanese don\\'t make planes as good as the FSX. We have the state of the art,\" Sen. Danforth says. \"This is one time the Japanese can\\'t tell us that our products aren\\'t good enough, or that they don\\'t need what we make.\"  Sen. Danforth estimates that the project would cost Japan $4 billion if the Japan Defense Agency buys its 100 FSX off U.S. assembly lines, but as much as $10 billion if it builds the plane itself. \"If the Japanese have a budget problem as they claim they do, why should they want to spend 2 1/2 times more for their planes than they have to?\" Sen. Danforth asks. U.S. officials couldn\\'t confirm this cost comparison, acknowledging only that the Mitsubishi group\\'s claim that it can develop the FSX for only $1 billion is far too optimistic.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has a long history of co-producing McDonnell Douglas fighters -- F-4 Phantoms in the 1960s and now F-15s -- and has independently built the older F-1 fighter, which the FSX is to replace. But its ability to go it alone on the FSX is debatable. U.S. officials who have seen the Defense Agency\\'s classified specifications say the agency is looking for a \"superplane.\"  The new fighter has to have enough firepower to sink Soviet ships crossing the strategic Tsugaru and Soya straits in the event of a superpower conflict. At the same time, Japan wants the FSX to be nimble enough to help the U.S. Air Force clear Japanese skies of intruding Soviet fighters of mid-1990s quality.  Many U.S. defense planners agree that the most sensible Japanese choice is to improve on an established U.S. model like McDonnell Douglas\\'s F/A-18 Hornet or General Dynamics\\'s F-16. Trying to reinvent these American planes would just be a \"waste of money,\" Donald Hicks told Japanese defense officials last year, just before he resigned as undersecretary of defense for research and engineering.  A spokesman for the Japanese Defense Agency said it would weigh arguments that Japan buy the plane from the U.S. against those for developing the aircraft domestically, but added that Japan is \"determined to choose the plane necessary for our country\\'s defense.\" A Mitsubishi spokesman added that while he couldn\\'t comment on the political aspects of the FSX controversy his company has the technological know-how to produce the FSX without foreign assistance. He said that, if Japan continued to rely on foreign technology, its defense capability would be diminished.  Japan wants to firm up the FSX program in time for initial funding in its fiscal year starting April 1988. Pentagon aides say that, whatever Japan decides, the U.S. will gain some FSX business in the form of jet engines and navigation and armament-control electronics. But whether the airframe order will be awarded exclusively to Japanese companies or shared with a U.S. partner is still a matter of speculation.  General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas say they are resubmitting their proposals for modifications of proven fighters in late March or early April. The Japan Defense Agency all but dismissed their first presentations last year.  Left to themselves, the Defense Agency and the Japanese air force would probably opt for self-development. But the Reagan administration is hoping that the decision will be kicked up to the cabinet, where national pride can be balanced against diplomatic and trade concerns. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0119': '</HL> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN> Politicians in such places as New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Iowa and Washington, D.C., have lately been giving banks a hard time over credit-card interest rates. So far the banks have been able to cope, partly by basing their card operations in states where politicians resist the temptation to politicize the marketplace.  But last week banks suddenly found themselves faced with a serious threat. It\\'s called competition. American Express Co. announced that it was bringing out its own variable-rate revolving credit card in May at an initial interest rate of 13.5%, well under what most banks charge. The new Amex \"Optima\" card competes head-on with bank cards in that users will be allowed to build up debt rather than be expected to pay their bills each month as Amex requires on its familiar green cards. Amex plans to keep its rates at a cozy 1.7 to 1.8 times the prime rate. It will have an excellent mailing list to work from, with 23.8 million American Express cardholders world-wide.  Expanded competition will accomplish far more for consumers than political sound and fury. If the political steam over \"high\" credit-card rates ever reached the point of a national-rate ceiling, as was proposed in a \"National Credit Card Protection Act\" debated in the Senate last year, it would be counterproductive for consumers. A study published in the January Federal Reserve Bulletin found that the likely effect of ceilings would be cost cutting by issuers, which would most likely take the form of requiring card applicants to meet higher standards. That would impact most heavily on lower-income families, who also have a hard time getting other forms of credit. Issuers probably would also add some fees. Even nonusers might feel the impact if retailers were forced to raise prices to cover fees or to offset loss of revenues from their own cards.  It is true that banks by and large have made cards a profitable business despite the substantial processing costs involved in handling this form of consumer credit. Some banks with problem loans have found credit cards to be one of their few reliable sources of earnings. The cards have the merit, much appreciated by banking regulators, of helping keep some troubled banks afloat.  They also have the merit of appealing to consumers, despite interest rates ranging upward of 20%. No one forces consumers to use them. If an interest rate looks high, they have the option of paying cash.  As it happens, consumers are becoming more interest-rate sensitive, or so it appears, knowing as they do that the new tax law will phase out interest paid on consumer credit as a deduction. In January, according to Fed figures, consumer credit advanced at an annual rate of only 1.1%, compared with an actual rate of 10.5% in 1986.  The greater consumer sensitivity to interest rates no doubt figured in Amex\\'s plans to take a plunge into the business with a lower-rate card. Credit-card interest almost certainly will come down. It will come down without rate ceilings. Nothing does it like competition. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0116': 'Pares 2-Tier Scale In Pact With Pilots --- By Francis C. Brown III Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AIRLINES (AIR) </IN> American Airlines\\' new pilots contract increases salaries for its new pilots as much as 29%, significantly weakening the two-tier wage concept that American pioneered.  \"It\\'s the beginning of the end for the two-tier pay scale,\" said Timothy Pettee, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.  But analysts said American won other concessions that will let it keep its labor-cost advantage over most of its major competitors, with the exception of Continental Airlines, a non-union carrier that has the lowest costs of any major carrier.  American, a unit of AMR Corp., reached agreement with its 6,000 pilots in February after almost a year of negotiations. American\\'s pilots union, the Allied Pilots Association, ratified the new three-year pact earlier this month. Both the airline and the union have refused to discuss the contract until the union explains the details to its members.  The hefty pay raise that American granted its new pilots represents a major retreat from the two-tier pay scale that American introduced in 1983. Under the system, pilots hired since 1983 are paid a lower wage scale than senior pilots. The system allows American to reduce its average labor costs through rapid internal growth by increasing the percentage of employees earning the lower scale.  Under American\\'s new contract, pilots hired under the lower pay scale, the B-scale, will now earn between 75% and 80% of the higher A-scale salary earned by pilots hired prior to 1983, estimates Kit Darby, vice president of the Future Aviation Professionals of America, an Atlanta group that tracks aviation careers. That is up from about 65% under the old contract, Mr. Darby says.  The new contract also provides that American\\'s B-scale pilots will jump to the higher scale after 10 years, or becoming a captain, whichever comes first. Under American\\'s old contract, the scales didn\\'t merge until 17 years. Because of American\\'s rapid expansion, some of its pilots could reach the rank of captain after only seven or eight years, Mr. Darby said.  Although those concessions lessen the advantage of the two-tier system, American still won a better contract than most of its competitors, analysts said. In recent contracts, most other carriers with two-tier systems have merged their pay scales after only five years.  Pilots hired since 1983 are the biggest winners under the new contract. B-scale pilots will receive immediate pay increases of between 11% and 29%, depending on experience and the type of plane they fly. On the other hand, senior pilots with more than 12 years of experience will only receive annual raises of about 2%. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0111': \"</HL> The drive for state tax reform is more fervent this year than at any time since the tax revolt of a decade ago. The impetus for all this activity, of course, is the new federal tax law, which shook this country's philosophy of taxation to its foundations.  Taxation used to be mainly a system for sweeping up revenue and applying it to public-spending commitments. Now the new tax system will encourage more economic growth. The lion's share of each extra dollar of new income will go to the productive person who worked for it, not to Uncle Sam.  But most states are still piggybacked on the old revenue-driven federal system. For many taxpayers, it could be a heavy load. If they fail to adjust rates to reflect the federal changes, 11 states will effectively impose tax increases ranging from 15% to 28% according to a National Governors Association Survey, and 10% to 15% in 11 other states. The biggest potential automatic hikes are in: Louisiana, 28%; Utah and Montana, 19%; Kansas and Oklahoma, 18%.  So far nine states plan no rate adjustment, which means their residents will be hit with backdoor tax hikes. Three states -- Illinois, Kansas and Iowa -- stand to gain windfalls of $100 million to $175 million. Other states expecting tax windfalls from $100 million to $700 million -- among them, Colorado, Missouri, Oregon, Maryland and Minnesota -- plan to return some and spend some. So their residents will also get socked with more taxes.  Only Ohio and New York have committed to returning their entire windfall to taxpayers. In other words, only two of more than 30 states expecting windfalls have promised their residents they won't raise their taxes. (The only other states that won't see an increase in taxes are those that don't peg assessments to the federal code -- New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- and the seven states with no state income tax of any kind.)  Ohio's Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, signed a law last December that lowers the state's personal income-tax rate across the board, reduces its top corporate income-tax rate and enlarges its lowest corporate tax bracket. These revisions will offset an expected tax windfall of more than $700 million over two years.  New York may go one step further. Despite a fair amount of public haggling over how big the cut should be and when it should take effect, Gov. Cuomo and the state legislature have promised to cut rates to offset New York's estimated $2 billion huge windfall. They also agreed last week to further trim personal and corporate rates -- reducing tax burdens even more. If the governor and state legislature follow through, New Yorkers will do better than break even on state taxes; they'll come out ahead.  Nearly half the states claim to be strapped for revenue, particularly those dependent on oil or agriculture. But legislators tempted to spend tax windfalls rather than cut spending may encounter opposition from taxpayers themselves. Utah's Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter plans to not only withhold the state's projected $50 million windfall from taxpayers but also to increase taxes by $200 million. This drew 3,000 anti-tax protesters to the state capital in Salt Lake City. Trying to sneak tax increases up the back stairs could prove unpopular when the racket wakes taxpayers up.  Perhaps the prickliest question confronting states that plan to return some or all of their tax bonanza to taxpayers is how the money should be distributed. As a large part of the windfall is derived from high-income individuals (mostly through bigger bites out of capital gains) and from corporations, it follows that they should receive the biggest state tax cuts. Ohio did exactly that, lowering its top personal rate to 6.9% from 8% on income above $100,000, and chopping its top corporate rate to 8.9% from 9.7%. These adjustments of rates won't result in smaller tax burdens for the state's wealthiest taxpayers; it only means their liabilities won't be any greater.  Other state governments wrangling over windfalls, however, see an opportunity to redistribute income from residents in top tax brackets to those in lower brackets. Missouri, Maryland and Colorado -- expecting windfalls of up to $200 million -- not only intend to withhold a sizable portion of their windfalls for legislators' pet projects, they also plan to adjust marginal rates so that taxpayers already paying the largest share of taxes pay an even greater share.  But what these states may gain in the short run by holding on to their windfalls and effectively raising their tax rates will likely be offset over time by a loss of revenue due to corporate capital flight and tax avoidance by high-income individuals. This is what is known as the dynamic effect of tax policy. Put another way, people with alternatives don't just stand there and let the tax man beat up on them. They move.  Only Ohio and New York so far have taken this dynamic analysis into account while preparing their tax-code revisions. That is what is known as a competitive advantage. \",\n",

In 1979, as one of the government\\'s leading ideologues, he set out to create consistency in its economic policies. His present maneuvering room, however, is the result of good luck as much as good management.  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\\'s economic policy has been transformed behind a rhetorical smokescreen that continues to stress consistency and discipline. In changing its approach, the government hasn\\'t hesitated to steal the clothes of the rival Labor and Alliance parties.  Most dramatically, the government decided last November to relax its grip on the public purse. Bowing to political pressure, Mr. Lawson evoked memories of Keynesian policies to stimulate demand by raising the government\\'s planned spending total for the fiscal year beginning April 1 by 4.75 billion pounds to 148.6 billion pounds and adding 5.5 billion pounds to tentative spending plans for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1988. (The pound is currently equivalent to $1.57.) But the heart of the strategy already had been altered. The government\\'s primary objective of reducing inflation and creating the conditions for stable growth was linked first to a target for sterling M3, Britain\\'s broad measure of money supply. In the fall of 1985, the government ceased using precise monetary targets.  \"We are coming to an end of an era in policies,\" says Peter Shore, a Labor member of Parliament and former minister for economic affairs. \"The ark of the covenant in 1979 was to control the money supply and regulate sterling M3,\" allied to public-spending cuts, lower government deficits and cuts in personal taxes. Since then, Mr. Shore contends, sterling M3 has been abandoned and public spending has risen. The deficit has declined solely because of the sale of former state-owned companies, he says, while the tax burden has risen for all except those in the higher brackets.  In a recent study, the independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research concludes that the 100,000-person drop in British unemployment since last summer owes nothing to the original philosophy of the Conservative government. Strict monetarist policies failed to create full employment through pushing down inflation-adjusted interest rates and depressing real wages. Instead, according to the institute, the drop in the seasonally adjusted jobless total to about 3.1 million reflects special training and job-creation schemes paid for by the public sector.  In place of former strictness, \"policy is now permitting, even encouraging, a rapid growth of consumer demand helped by easy credit conditions and fast growth of real earnings, not least in the public sector itself,\" the institute says.  The covert change in policy worries some government supporters. The forecasting unit of the London Business School, normally sympathetic to the government\\'s policies, has noted that \"contrary to the stated aims of the government, public expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product is higher now than in 1979.\"  Late last year, a House of Commons committee dominated by Conservatives concluded that the government\\'s medium-term financial strategy lacked \"a coherent framework for the setting of fiscal policy.\" The committee said \"a substantial change in policy\" had occurred in public expenditure control, money supply and the use of interest and exchange rates. These changes should be \"openly explained and avowed,\" it said.  But most of Mrs. Thatcher\\'s supporters probably prefer her chancellor to pursue a pragmatic policy, particularly if it holds the hope of reelection. The dogmatic monetarism of Mrs. Thatcher\\'s early years is now viewed widely as a mistake and a major cause of industrial closures in the early 1980s, when companies were caught between an unsustainably high exchange rate and interest rates approaching 20%.  It also fit badly with the traditions of modern Conservatism. It\\'s no coincidence that a large oil painting of Benjamin Disraeli takes pride of place in the hall of Mr. Lawson\\'s official Downing Street residence. Mr. Disraeli was a supreme pragmatist who launched the modern Conservative Party on the strength of stealing and adapting rival Liberal plans for parliamentary reform in 1867.  Since abandoning the rigid policies of Mrs. Thatcher\\'s early years, Mr. Lawson has permitted a major devaluation of sterling and apparently ignored a shift in the current-account balance of payments from a surplus of 2.9 billion pounds in 1985 to a deficit of 1.1 billion pounds in 1986.  But senior Treasury officials claim that the essentials of the government\\'s \"medium-term financial strategy\" have been preserved. In particular, Mrs. Thatcher\\'s government has put an end to the previous \"stop-go\" cycle of short-term fiscal stimulus and credit squeeze, the hallmark of British policy for much of the 1960s and 1970s. Labor governments back then tried several fiscal packages a year as they struggled to fine-tune an economy wracked by rampant inflation.  The financial markets, which for much of 1986 suspected Britain was headed for rising inflation and a balance-of-payments crisis, now appear to be giving the government the benefit of the doubt. By bidding sterling higher after the March 10 half-percentage-point cut in British bank base rates to 10.5%, the foreign-exchange market has given Mrs. Thatcher\\'s government a vote of confidence ahead of the budget.  The British economy still has plenty of black spots. The 3.1 million unemployed compare with only 1.3 million when Mrs. Thatcher came to power. Of the unemployed, some 40% have been without work for more than a year, compared with only 10% in the 1960s. Britain\\'s annual inflation rate of about 4% is low in historical terms, but higher than in most competitor countries. The nation continues to bear the scars of the deep recession of 1980-81 with a depressed northern region and manufacturing production still 4% below the peak level of the previous business cycle.  But Britain also has been able to maintain steady economic growth over six years of such major shocks as the Falklands war, the miners strike and last year\\'s halving of oil prices. The government can take credit for creating the framework for far-reaching changes in the economy. The Thatcher years have seen the eclipse of trade-union power, widespread deregulation, the sale to private investors of state-owned industries and the encouragement of new entrepreneurs.  For the moment, financial markets see a country where projected real growth of 3.5% this year probably will exceed that of its major industrialized trading partners; where industrial productivity is rising rapidly and where a sudden surge of tax revenues should enable Mr. Lawson to concoct an election-winning budget.  Confidence has grown as government revenues have surged. Corporation tax income has soared, thanks to increased company profits and the impact of 1984 reform lowering rates and closing out of shelters. The consumer boom has prompted a surge in value-added tax receipts. The greatly increased volume of securities transactions since October\\'s deregulation in the City is expected to boost stamp-duty payments.  For Mr. Lawson, the markets\\' newly discovered enthusiasm for Britain is a vital piece of good news. When he takes his secret tax plans from the antique red wood-and-leather \"budget box\" next Tuesday, he will be under fewer economic constraints than any chancellor since the Conservative Party took power in Britain under Mrs. Thatcher in 1979.  Many analysts now believe the chancellor will have at least five billion pounds to \"give away\" on a combination of tax cuts, increased public spending and a reduced government deficit. The City consensus is that a two-percentage-point cut in the basic income-tax rate to 27% and a two billion pound reduction to five billion pounds in the next fiscal year\\'s deficit will most likely be at the center of the chancellor\\'s plans.  Some analysts like David Wileman, senior economist at ANZ Merchant Bank Ltd., believe that by approving the March 10 interest-rate cut the authorities were signaling \"that there will be no nasty surprises\" in the budget. Although Mr. Lawson\\'s long-term ambition is to cut the basic rate of British income tax to 25%, he is expected to resist the temptation so that he can appear prudent and reap the benefits of further interest-rate declines.  But he also must meet great expectations, not least from the prime minister, his next-door neighbor in Downing Street. Although the election deadline is June 1988, party activists are champing at the bit and the country in general is in a pre-election mood. Tomorrow\\'s announcement could determine whether Mrs. Thatcher will choose to go to the polls as early as this spring for a mandate to build on the suprise successes of her pragmatic economic policy.  --- Mr. Norman covers European economic news for the Journal.

The findings, based on surveys by the agency\\'s field staff and on information from the World Bank and other multilateral banks, indicated that Western donors are succeeding in their efforts to halt environmentally risky projects or modify them to minimize harm to forests, soil and water reserves. The multilateral banks had planned to provide more than $900 million for the nine projects.  The largest project being delayed, India\\'s $1.2 billion Narmada River development, needs to be reexamined and \"await environmental clearance\" by the New Delhi government, the report said.  The report indicated that two projects -- India\\'s Cauvery River development and a Haitian tree-planting plan -- have been effectively canceled because of the World Bank\\'s decision to drop them from its lending program. The U.S. agency warned that the Haitian project could \"lead to destructive land use and exploitation.\"  Another project, the Dominican Republic\\'s $441 million plan to process gold and silver ores, is in danger of being scrapped, according to the report. The U.S. agency reported that the Dominican government is \"now considering whether to proceed with this project request.\" The Inter-American Development Bank, the project\\'s main financier, is engaging in \"no further design\" on it, the report said.  The report said Nepal\\'s plan to dam the Babai River for irrigation purposes is \"delayed indefinitely\" because of the danger of harming the river ecology. The International Development Association, the World Bank\\'s concessionary lending agency, intended to provide more than half of the project\\'s $64.5 million cost.  The Inter-American Development Bank also dropped Guyana\\'s $250 million Tumaturmari hydroelectric project from its current lending program, making the project\\'s future status \"uncertain,\" the report said.  The remaining two projects facing delays for similar reasons are Colombia\\'s Urra II dam, an irrigation expansion in Burma, and a hydroelectric dam in Niger.  The U.S. aid agency\\'s report covered 28 Third World projects that were to receive funding from multilateral development banks but that are believed to have environmental problems. The report was submitted to Congress in response to a request for the agency to monitor the environmental aspects of projects financed by the multilateral development banks.  \"This is an early-warning system, and not a hit list,\" said Richard Bissell, the agency\\'s assistant administrator for program and policy coordination.  The agency removed a refinery project in Ghana and a Jordanian contruction project from its \"watch list\" because both are no longer regarded to be environmentally hazardous. ',\n",

       " 'WSJ870316-0095': 'For Its 2nd Quarter on Higher Revenue --- By Brenton R. Schlender Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Micron Technology Inc., a semiconductor maker that had hoped a U.S.-Japanese trade agreement would help it bounce back to profitability, said it expects to report its fiscal second-quarter loss widened to $11 million.  The Boise, Idaho-based company, which has had losses for nearly two years as Japanese semiconductor makers flooded U.S. markets with memory chips, said its revenue for the quarter ended March 5 more than doubled to about $20.4 million. A year earlier, Micron posted a loss of $9.8 million on revenue of $9.4 million.  In its first quarter ended Dec. 4, the company had a net loss of $9.7 million on revenue of $18.8 million; in fiscal 1986 ended Sept. 3, Micron had a loss of $33.9 million on revenue of $48.9 million.  \"If you look at our position today versus a year ago, you can see we have made progress diversifying our product line,\" said Juan Benitez, Micron\\'s president and chief operating officer. Besides shrinking the size, and thus the cost, of its flagship product, the 256-kilobit dynamic random access memory chip, or D-RAM, Micron also has started producing sample quantities of its next-generation one-megabit D-RAM. Costs associated with developing those products, Mr. Benitez said, were largely responsible for the wider loss.  \"We feel with the combination of these products we\\'ll see a turnaround sometime soon,\" Mr. Benitez concluded, perhaps within two quarters.  Analysts weren\\'t so sanguine. Michael Stark, an analyst with Robertson Coleman &amp; Stephens, said Micron\\'s second-quarter loss is just further evidence that \"you just can\\'t make any money in the D-RAM business.\" He said chip companies use their extra plant capacity to make D-RAMs when they can\\'t make more value-added products, forcing Micron \"to compete at the bottom of the barrel.\"  Mr. Benitez conceded that Micron was still hurt by severe price competition in its 256-kilobit D-RAM business, which accounts for 90% of its sales. \"Something\\'s definitely wrong,\" he said. \"We still need some relief from market pricing.\"  He asserted, however, that the recent \"mean talk\" -- from federal government officials criticizing Japan\\'s spotty compliance with the recent trade agreement covering chip sales in the U.S. and abroad -- seemed to be working. U.S. officials have threatened to impose sanctions on other Japanese products if Japanese chip makers don\\'t honor U.S. set prices for certain chips, chiefly 256-kilobit D-RAMs. \"We are starting to see some positive results finally,\" Mr. Benitez said.  Mr. Stark of Robertson Coleman &amp; Stephens, however, said he doesn\\'t think D-RAM pricing will improve much this year, even if the U.S. sanctions certain products of Japanese companies to force compliance. \"That pact is just not enforceable.\"  Meantime, Micron is hoping to become the first U.S. maker to sell commercial quantities of one-megabit D-RAMs, Mr. Benitez said. \"We\\'re doing sampling now of one-megabit chips for the military,\" he said.  --- Peter Waldman contributed to this article.

       " 'WSJ870316-0093': 'Tax Law Raises Cost of Gifts To Grandchild --- By Sanford L. Jacobs Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> Leaving a pile of money to the grandchildren can be awfully expensive under the new tax act. Indeed, because of a tough new generation-skipping tax, the government could wind up with more than the grandchild.  The average family needn\\'t worry. The first $1 million a grandparent passes on to grandchildren, by gift or bequest, is exempt under the new tax. And until the end of 1989, there is an even more generous exemption: $2 million a recipient.  Even so, a lot of business owners, successful investors, executives and owners of property that has multiplied in value may need to reexamine their estate plans. \"When you start adding up assets in a family business, the value of a home and maybe another home . . . people can wind up with this tax to pay,\" says Arthur S. Hoffman, a partner with accountants Oppenheim, Appell, Dixon &amp; Co.  The generation-skipping tax is a flat rate equal to the maximum gift and estate rate: 55% this year, 50% thereafter. Its purpose is to assure that wealth is taxed to each generation within a family.  Up to now, a popular way to save taxes has been to skip a generation, for example, with a trust created at a grandparent\\'s death. The trust would pay income earned on its assets to the grandparent\\'s son. Then, when the son died, the assets would go to his children. The assets would be subject to estate taxes only when the grandparent died; there wouldn\\'t be any additional tax when the son died.  Under the new tax act, however, the generation-skipping tax would be imposed when the trust paid the assets to the grandchild. There is an exemption for trusts set up before Sept. 26, 1985. Any increase in the value of the exempt assets is also exempt. But additional assets put into such a trust after that date aren\\'t exempt.  (There is no generation-skipping tax on assets left by a grandparent to children of a deceased son or daughter.)  Making direct gifts to grandchildren can incur the heftiest tax bite under the new rules. Marcia K. Marshall, a lawyer and estate planner with Research Institute of America, income-tax information publishers, provides an example.  Suppose a grandparent who had already used up the $1 million exemption wanted to give $2 million, after taxes, to a grandchild. After 1989, the grandparent would have to come up with another $1 million to pay the 50% generation-skipping tax.  Moreover, the grandparent would have to pay a gift tax on the combined value of the gift and the generation-skipping tax; the gift tax on $3 million would be $1.5 million. That would bring the total tax bill to $2.5 million -- and raise the grandparent\\'s total outlay to $4.5 million.  If the grandparent wanted to lay out $2 million altogether, then the grandchild would get about $888,888, after taxes.  Accountants and lawyers are just beginning to find ways to plan around the rules. One focus of their attention is the $1 million exemption for each grandparent.  The new rules provide that once assets are exempt from the tax they are always exempt, no matter how much they increase in value. As a result, says Dallas lawyer Rodney J. Owens, tax-saving strategies will involve exempting assets with the biggest appreciation potential.  One approach, Mr. Owens says, uses a grantor retained income trust, or GRIT. Such a trust gives the person creating it, called the grantor, the right to all income earned on trust assets for a specified time, say 10 years. After that the assets go to the designated beneficiaries.  Setting up a GRIT involves a gift, but its value for gift tax qualifies for discounting because the assets aren\\'t given to the beneficiaries right away. Using Internal Revenue Service discount tables, it is easy to select an amount and a period of time that will match the $600,000 gift-tax exemption so no tax is due. For instance, $1,556,420 put into a 10-year trust has a current taxable gift value of $600,000.  This approach may not help very elderly taxpayers, however. The reason: If the grantor dies before the trust expires, the assets are subject to estate tax.  Meanwhile, there may be at least some good news in the new law. It provides for refunds of taxes paid under the previous generation-skipping tax. The old tax, which was enacted in 1976, was generally ineffective. An IRS spokesman says officials believe \"not very many people paid it.\"  Still, anyone who did can claim a refund on Form 843. ',\n",

Zweig Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN> New York banks will be able to acquire New Jersey banking concerns beginning next Jan. 1, six months earlier than previously expected, banking industry officials said.  The timetable was accelerated by enactment earlier this month of an interstate banking bill in Wyoming.  Analysts said the development could hasten the pace of bank acquisitions in New Jersey, which New York banks consider one of the nation\\'s most desirable banking markets.  \"This makes it likely that consummation of deals will take place sooner rather than later,\" said James J. McDermott Jr., chief of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a New York-based securities firm specializing in bank stocks. \"It could push interested parties to act more quickly.\"  Wyoming Gov. Michael Sullivan signed a bill March 6 allowing banking concerns outside the state to acquire Wyoming banks under certain restrictions.  The effective date of New Jersey\\'s reciprocal banking law is triggered by the latest effective date of reciprocal laws in 13 other states. But the passage of the Wyoming legislation, which is effective May 22, reshuffled the previous order of effective dates for the laws in those states. That, in turn, shifted the effective date of New Jersey\\'s law to Jan. 1, 1988, from July 1, 1988.  In a related matter, Chemical New York Corp. said the apparent change in effective dates in New Jersey wouldn\\'t affect the timing of its plans, announced last May, to acquire Morristown, N.J.-based Horizon Bancorp.  The transaction, which calls for Horizon shareholders to receive cash amounting to 2.5 times the book value of Horizon\\'s common, is scheduled to occur one year after the effective date of full interstate banking in New Jersey, or Jan. 1, 1989, whichever is earlier. A Chemical spokesman said, \"There are no plans to accelerate the transaction from the currently scheduled date.\"  Several major New York banks also have expressed interest in expanding to New Jersey, including Chase Manhattan Corp., Bank of New York Co. and Citicorp.  \"We continue to be interested in New Jersey, because we see it as an integral part of our logical market for retail and commercial banking. We continue to be on the lookout for attractive opportunities,\" said a spokesman for Bank of New York.  Barbara Goldsmith, New Jersey\\'s deputy attorney general for banking, said state officials haven\\'t completed a review of the other states\\' banking laws to determine if they meet New Jersey\\'s requirements.  But Richard E. Harden, secretary of the New Jersey Bankers Association, said that while he hadn\\'t yet reviewed the Wyoming law, it appears to shift the effective date of the New Jersey law to Jan. 1. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870316-0091': '4th-Period Loss Of $73.6 Million --- Firm Agrees With Air Force To End T-46A Program; Deficit Is Tied to Charges --- By Francine Schwadel Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> EARNINGS (ERN) AEROSPACE (ARO) DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN> Fairchild Industries Inc. posted a fourth-quarter loss of $73.6 million, primarily because of charges related to ending production of its trainer jet and closing the plant where the jet was built.  The Chantilly, Va.-based aerospace, industrial and electronics concern posted net income of $3.8 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier.  Fairchild said that, as expected, it reached agreement with the Air Force to stop work on the T-46A trainer jet. As a result, Fairchild said it will close its Farmingdale, N.Y., plant this year and dismiss most of the plant\\'s 2,800 employees. The workers represent about a quarter of Fairchild\\'s 11,000 employees.  The plant closing will mark the end of an era at Fairchild. For 56 years, the company built military aircraft at its Fairchild Republic unit on Long Island, N.Y., including planes flown in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.  Emanuel Fthenakis, the company\\'s chairman, expressed regret about the decision, but said Fairchild will be able to move forward with plans to emphasize its communications and electronics operations.  In the year and a half since the Air Force stated its intention to cancel the trainer-jet program, Mr. Fthenakis said, the program \"has occupied a substantial amount of management time and effort. Now we will be able to focus on the other businesses.\"  Last year, Fairchild engaged in a lobbying blitz that succeeded in winning a stay of execution for the program when Congress directed the Air Force to hold a competition for a new trainer jet. But the Air Force didn\\'t set up the competition because senior military officers maintained the service couldn\\'t pay for a new trainer even if a competition were held.  Meanwhile, the Air Force was scheduled to receive 10 Fairchild planes. Even that purchase was seen as a waste. \"We don\\'t have a need for 10 aircraft,\" said Air Force Assistant Secretary Thomas Cooper.  Under terms of its agreement with the Air Force, Fairchild said it won\\'t build nine of the 10 T-46A aircraft called for in the original contract. Mr. Cooper estimated that the cancellation would save the government $40 million. Rather than buy new trainers, the Air Force plans to upgrade its existing fleet of T-37 trainers. \"We\\'re going to squeeze another decade out of them,\" Mr. Cooper said.  Industry analysts viewed the decision favorably. An immediate end to work on the trainer jet is \"the easiest and probably least painful way to terminate the program, as opposed to casting more money after it,\" said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst at First Boston Corp.  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Fairchild closed at $13.25, unchanged.  In the latest quarter, the company said it added $9 million to the $120 million it had reserved already for losses on the program. The company also created a $50.4 million reserve for anticipated costs of closing the plant, a spokesman said.  In the quarter, Fairchild said it had a loss of $3.1 million on continuing operations. It had a loss of $67.6 million on discontinued operations, primarily because of the charges. A gain related to the recovery of excess pension fund assets was more than offset by a charge for the reversal of a tax-loss carry-forward.  In the year-earlier quarter, the company\\'s earnings included $2 million in earnings from continuing operations and $1.8 million from the now-discontinued aircraft operation on Long Island.  Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $165.9 million from $162.3 million a year earlier.  For the full year, Fairchild posted a loss of $10 million, compared with a loss of $167.1 million in 1985. Sales rose 12% to $643.3 million from $576.3 million in 1985. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870316-0090': 'At Volkswagen Sets Resignation --- In Wake of Currency Fraud, Firm Also Shuffles Top Of Its Financial Division --- By Terence Roth Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Volkswagen AG\\'s chief financial officer, Rolf Selowsky, resigned over the weekend in response to the West German auto maker\\'s disclosure last week that foreign-exchange fraud cost it as much as $259 million.  The management board member\\'s resignation followed Friday\\'s announcement of a shake-up in the upper levels of VW\\'s finance division, which included the ouster of the company\\'s foreign-exchange manager, who had previously been on vacation status. And it came as West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the foreign-exchange scandal might delay the government\\'s plans to sell its 20% stake in VW to the public this year.  Mr. Selowsky, the chief financial officer, had been scheduled to step down when his contract expired April 30. His decision to resign early was meant to claim managerial responsibility for allowing the manipulation of VW\\'s huge dollar positions to take place, a VW spokesman said. However, there weren\\'t any indications from the company or investigators that the 56-year-old Mr. Selowsky was actually involved in the foreign-exchange manipulation.  The Wolfsburg-based auto maker last week alerted state attorneys to its discovery of \"criminal manipulation\" in its huge foreign-exchange positions that involved the erasure of computer data and tampering with computer programs in 1984. Public prosecutors have said they are trying to establish a link with persons or institutions outside VW.  Investigators are \"questioning just about anybody who could conceivably have had anything to do with the case,\" said a spokesman for the state attorney\\'s office in Braunschweig, which has jurisdiction for Wolfsburg.  Local prosecutors have been joined in the investigation by the Federal Crime Bureau, West Germany\\'s federal law-enforcement agency. And Frankfurt state attorneys are looking for possible links to West Germany\\'s banking center.  The suspected conspiracy left VW completely exposed to the huge-foreign exchange loss in the dollar market, apparently after the culprits forged forward contracts. The dollar was strong in 1984, and the people involved in the fraud apparently expected the currency to continue to rise. Instead, they were caught short when the dollar peaked and began a steady decline.  The reorganization of the finance division, announced Friday, included the summary dismissal of VW\\'s foreign-exchange manager, Burkhard Junger. Additionally, two senior executives were suspended, and four junior traders in the foreign-exchange operation were \"placed on vacation.\"  Guenther Borchert, head of VW\\'s finance and payments division, was relieved of duties until further notice. The 57-year-old Mr. Borchert reported to Mr. Selowsky. Also suspended was Siegfried Mueller, the 56-year-old head of the department for money and foreign-exchange clearing. The senior executives were suspended for management failure.  Mr. Junger, the foreign-exchange manager, had already given notice in January to leave VW over \"differences\" on how the foreign-exchange operations should be run. VW had put the 39-year-old department head on vacation status to allow him to look for another job, a common severance practice for West German managers. His employment at VW would have officially ended in September, or with the start of a new job. Mr. Junger has been seeking a position in the foreign-exchange department of Bankers Trust New York Corp. in Frankfurt.  VW wouldn\\'t explain the reasons for the summary dismissal that ended its arrangement with Mr. Junger. But the end of the severance pay amounts to a breach of West Germany\\'s rigid labor laws that a company can defend only with a serious grievance against an employee.  Mr. Junger, who couldn\\'t be reached for comment, was quoted in today\\'s edition of Der Spiegel magazine as denying any wrongdoing. He reportedly has agreed to cooperate with the state attorneys and criminal bureau in their investigation.  The magazine said VW\\'s suspicion of criminal action solidified on Feb. 18, when the National Bank of Hungary declined to recognize a dollar futures contract that VW\\'s records showed it had. The Hungarian bank claimed to have no record of the transaction in its own books and wouldn\\'t cover VW\\'s dollar position, according to the magazine account.  Meanwhile, the official probe into VW\\'s charges has hurt the company\\'s share price and the prospects for the government\\'s sale of its VW stake.  After VW\\'s initial announcement early last week, the stock price plunged 9.2% before recovering a few points later in the week. The $259 million loss nearly equals VW\\'s last reported net group earnings of $322 million in 1985.  The government has hoped to sell its VW shares this year as part of its denationalization plans. But \"we now have to ask ourselves whether we can still hold on to that scheduling,\" Mr. Stoltenberg, the finance minister, said in a newspaper interview. He questioned the competence of some VW managers, but said he didn\\'t hold VW\\'s supervisory and managing boards responsible. The alleged fraud was an act of \"reprehensible criminal behavior\" occurring below the managing-board level, he said. ',\n",

Harper &amp; Row said its board named a committee of outside directors to consider the company\\'s alternatives, which also could include proceeding with its current business plans, possible business combinations and sale of all or part of the company. The publisher also said it hired Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. as its financial adviser.  The directors met Friday, for the first time since Harper &amp; Row received the unsolicited offers. As previously reported, Theodore Cross, an investor, made an offer last Monday of $34 a share, or about $141 million, for the 170-year-old publisher. Two days later, Orlando, Fla.-based Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. offered $50 a share, or $220 million. Mr. Cross and Harcourt Brace officials couldn\\'t be reached for comment.  Harper &amp; Row common shares closed Friday at $50.125, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 316,700 shares. The company has about 4.4 million shares outstanding.  A Harper &amp; Row spokeswoman yesterday declined to comment beyond a prepared statement, and top officials of the company couldn\\'t be reached. In the statement, however, the company indicated dismay at the turn of events. \"The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company\\'s position as one of the nation\\'s leading independent publishers, and take advantage of our considerable future prospects,\" said Winthrop Knowlton, a director and the publisher\\'s former chief executive officer.  \"However,\" he added in the statement, \"given the significant current interest in the company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available.\"  Following last week\\'s offers, securities analysts subsequently speculated that a bidding war could start for Harper &amp; Row, a major educational book publisher that also puts out medical and professional books. Moreover, analysts and industry officials concluded that the developments surrounding Harper &amp; Row probably signal further consolidation that could leave the industry with only a handful of major publishers.  In a related action, Harper &amp; Row directors postponed indefinitely an April 2 special meeting for shareholders to vote on a recapitalization proposal and a plan to create two classes of stock with unequal voting rights.  Separately, Standard &amp; Poor\\'s Corp. said it downgraded about $200 million of subordinated debt and commercial paper of Harcourt Brace after the company\\'s offer for Harper &amp; Row.  S&amp;P said it downgraded Harcourt\\'s subordinated debt to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus and its commercial paper to A-3 from A-2. The rating concern said Harcourt\\'s $220 million bid for Harper &amp; Row, coming after its $500 million debt-financed purchase of CBS Inc.\\'s publishing group last year, signals a \"much more aggressive policy regarding acquisitions than previously assumed.\"  The downgradings \"reflect Harcourt\\'s new direction even if the proposed transaction ultimately doesn\\'t take place,\" S&amp;P said. The rating concern said a fully debt-financed acquisition would raise the company\\'s pro-forma debt leverage to nearly 70% from 63%.  Harcourt officials didn\\'t return phone calls seeking comment on the S&amp;P action. ',\n",

In a letter to Supermarkets General\\'s board on Friday, Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, Dart\\'s chairman and president respectively, urged the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer to meet with Dart \"promptly.\"  The letter said, \"We are prepared to negotiate all terms of an acquisition agreement.\" In an interview yesterday, Robert Haft said these terms include the final price Dart would be willing to pay.  But a source close to Supermarkets General\\'s deliberations indicated that the company desires to remain independent.  As previously reported, Dart made an unsolicited offer on March 6 to buy Supermarkets General for $41.75 a share. The Landover, Md.-based discount retailer said it was \"most interested,\" in a \"friendly\" transaction.  In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Supermarkets General closed at $43.25, up $1, indicating that investors expect a higher bid to emerge.  But since then, Supermarkets General, in apparent attempt to resist the bid, has been weighing its options. These include seeking another suitor, taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own. Supermarkets General hasn\\'t had any contact with Dart since last Monday, when it said it would consider the Dart offer, Mr. Haft said.  \"We\\'re trying to assure that we are part of (Supermarkets General\\'s decisionmaking) process,\" Mr. Haft said in the interview. \"We wouldn\\'t want to wake up one morning and find out they had sold the company for $41.76 a share.\"  Mr. Haft said that \"to show good faith,\" Dart hasn\\'t added to the 1.9 million Supermarkets General\\'s shares it acquired earlier this year. That stake represents less than 5% of the food retailer\\'s total shares outstanding.  Dart won\\'t increase its stake \"while we are communicating and if we feel we are making progress in our discussions,\" Mr. Haft said.  But Mr. Haft didn\\'t rule out the possibility of making a tender offer or buying more shares in the open market, if Supermarkets General declines to negotiate.  Some analysts have speculated that Dart might be more interested in putting Supermarkets General into play than in buying the company. They note that last year, after a bid for Safeway Stores Inc., the nation\\'s largest supermarket chain, Dart made a profit of roughly $140 million on its Safeway holdings when the concern was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in a leveraged buyout.  But Mr. Haft denied that Dart has any intentions of selling its shares back to Supermarkets General at a premium. \"We want to own the company,\" he said. \"Our shares our not for sale.\"  Robert E. Wunderle, vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General, confirmed the company received what he characterized as a \"follow-up\" letter from the Hafts. \"There was nothing substantively new in it,\" he said. \"They urged us to discuss their proposal with them.\"  Mr. Wunderle said Supermarkets General intends to contact Dart today to acknowledge receipt of the letter. But he stressed that the Dart proposal is still being studied by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which was retained by the food retailer as soon as it received the unsolicited offer.  \"We\\'re really not in any position to formally respond to the proposal until we receive Shearson\\'s report back,\" he said. Added a source close to the Supermarkets General deliberations: \"It\\'s preposterous to think you can sit down and talk about selling or restructuring $1.6 billion in assets in a few days. Shearson needs time to look at all the alternatives.\"  The source close to the deliberations emphasized there has been \"no change\" in Supermarkets General\\'s thinking. \"There remains the strong desire to stay independent and they (Supermarkets General) are exploring all the options in light of the Dart offer.\"  Mr. Wunderle said the company\\'s stock closed on Friday above the bid price because of a televised report that indicated that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, proposed to take Supermarkets General private for $45 a share. \"We aren\\'t aware of any proposal by KKR,\" Mr. Wunderle said.  In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870316-0087': 'Reach Accord On \\'Tied Aid\\' --- By Art Pine Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN> The U.S. and other industrialized countries have reached an accord on restricting the use of \"tied aid\" -- the practice of sweetening export financing with foreign-aid grants.  The accord ends a three-year campaign by Washington to persuade its economic allies to cut back on the use of tied-aid credits. The U.S. has argued that unfair competition is created when government export financing is laced with foreign-aid grants to persuade foreign purchasers to buy products.  Agreement on the pact came after Japan, the last holdout in the three-year negotiations, signaled it would go along with a compromise formula that essentially follows the U.S. demands. The accord is expected to be announced today by the 24-country Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices it was hammered out.  Essentially, the accord seeks to discourage the use of tied aid by making it more costly for governments to offer such joint financing packages. Toward that end, the agreement first will raise the minimum aid levels required in any tied-aid package to 35%, up from 25% now.  It also will change the formula for calculating the foreign-aid component of such packages, so as to raise the cost for countries such as Japan, West Germany and the Netherlands that traditionally maintain unusually low interest rates.  The new rules will be phased in over two years beginning in July. The subsidy level will be based on a country\\'s actual interest rates and an arbitrary 10% \"norm\" rate.  The accord also will alter existing restrictions on the use of interest subsidies in ordinary export-financing transactions. Subsidies on loans or guarantees to industrial democracies and to the Soviet Union -- now only minuscule -- will be prohibited entirely.  The subsidy ceiling on export financing for the poorest developing countries will be raised to 50% from the current 25%. And the minimum interest rate for transactions involving newly industrializing countries and low-income developing countries will be raised three-tenths of a percentage point.  Prohibiting subsidized loans to the Soviet Union has been another longstanding U.S. goal. The Reagan administration has been arguing for years that Moscow doesn\\'t need subsidies, which were intended originally for developing countries. But until now, the European countries, which trade heavily with the Soviets, had refused to go along.  Washington had pushed hard for the new accord, at one point even asking Congress for a $300 million \"war chest\" to help match other countries\\' subsidies in an effort to pressure them into cutting back on using them.

       " 'WSJ870316-0086': 'Harder Stance On Brazil Debt --- Concern May Put the Loans On Cash Basis Following Suspension of Payments --- By Peter Truell Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Citicorp has signaled that it can withstand a long showdown with Brazil over the country\\'s suspension of interest payments on some $67 billion of foreign bank debt. But any such confrontation could slash Citicorp\\'s 1987 net income by as much as $190 million, the nation\\'s largest banking company disclosed. Such a cut would have equaled 18% of the $1.06 billion that Citicorp earned in 1986.  Citicorp\\'s signal came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that said the parent of Citibank may have to put its $3.9 billion of medium-term and long-term bank loans to Brazil on a so-called cash basis following Brazil\\'s Feb. 20 interest payments suspension.  Brazil\\'s finance minister, Dilson Funaro, has said that his country -- the developing world\\'s biggest debtor, with $108 billion owed to foreign creditors -- wants a new solution to the debt crisis and will resume interest payments only after it has negotiated this with its creditors.  Loans are placed on a cash, or non-accrual, basis because of doubts about their collectability. This means income from the loans is recognized only when payments are received. Before Feb. 20, Brazil had only been paying interest, but hadn\\'t been repaying principal, on its bank debt. Under U.S. regulations, banks are required to put loans on a non-accrual basis 90 days after a missed interest payment.  \"If it is decided that these loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, based on existing interest rates . . . the impact in the first quarter would be approximately $50 million after tax, and for the full year would be approximately $190 million after tax,\" Citicorp said in an SEC filing in connection with a proposed issue of $225 million of adjustable-rate preferred stock.  Citicorp said in the filing that it would be premature to put its Brazilian loans on a non-accrual basis now. It said it would reevaluate the decision at the end of the first quarter.  Citicorp\\'s stock price fell Friday on news of its filing, but later recovered to close unchanged at $52.125 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Several other major bank stocks weakened after Citicorp\\'s move.  Citicorp\\'s disclosure raises the stakes in the war of nerves between the international banking community and Brazil. The Citicorp move \"will increase anxiety among banks with big Brazilian (loans),\" said Clark Miller, the executive vice president who heads Bank of Boston Corp.\\'s international department. Other major banks may soon have to follow Citicorp\\'s lead, bank analysts said.  Citicorp\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, John S. Reed, has adopted a tough stance on international debt, urging that debtor nations shouldn\\'t be allowed to err far from market rates of interest.  Some bankers are skeptical of Citicorp\\'s latest move. \"It\\'s posturing designed to make the Brazilians more malleable,\" said a banker at another big U.S. bank, who declined to be identified. A Citicorp spokesman denied such claims, stating this was part of the bank\\'s duty to disclose information to the public and potential investors. \"The filing had no relation to negotiations with the government of Brazil,\" a Citicorp spokesman said.  Some banks said they aren\\'t prepared to follow Citicorp, at least not yet. At J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., a spokesman said, \"we have no plans to make any such disclosure.\" Spokesmen for Bankers Trust Co. and First Chicago Corp. said it was premature to decide whether Brazilian loans should be put on a cash basis. \"It\\'s our expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet its debt,\" the First Chicago spokesman said.  BankAmerica Corp. declined to comment on Citicorp\\'s plans. But banking sources said that unless Brazil hardens its stance further, the company is unlikely to put its Brazilian loans on nonperforming status until they are 90 days past due.  Of all the major Brazilian lenders, BankAmerica is the least well-equipped to withstand a lengthy moratorium on interest payments. The financially troubled company had hoped to report an operating profit for 1987 after two years of huge losses, but Brazil\\'s action could derail the expected turnaround, at least temporarily. It has $2.74 billion of Brazilian loans outstanding, indicating it will have to defer nearly $50 million of interest income each quarter that all of the loans are on nonperforming status. BankAmerica declined to comment on the financial impact of the moratorium.  Some regional banks applauded Citicorp\\'s statement. \"It\\'s a rather brave but necessary move,\" said Kenneth Taylor, a senior international officer at Hartford, Conn.-based Connecticut National Bank. \"Brave, because such a large amount of money is involved,\" he added.  Citicorp is the largest bank lender to Brazil, with $4.6 billion of loans outstanding, according to its recently released 1986 annual report. This includes $700 million of short-term trade credits and money market deposits on which Brazil is currently paying interest. The balance consists of the $3.9 billion in medium-term and long-term bank debt. Brazil has an estimated $67 billion of medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt, and has an additional estimated $10 billion in short-term trade credits and money market deposits owed to foreign banks.  A long dispute with Brazil would hit big U.S. banks\\' earnings substantially, according to a recent study by Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., which specializes in analyzing bank stocks. It estimates that a prolonged payments moratorium on all banks\\' Brazilian assets -- including short-term loans, which are now being serviced by Brazil -- would on average have knocked 17% off the 10 biggest U.S. banks\\' 1986 earnings. That ranges from a 10% estimated hit for J.P. Morgan to 32% at Manufacturers Hanover Corp.  Some banks challenged Keefe Bruyette\\'s numbers. A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover said the bank has $1 billion of short-term assets to Brazil on which it is being paid interest, and the Keefe Bruyette estimates are far too high. \"The numbers just are no good,\" he said.  At First Chicago, a spokesman said the bank\\'s Brazilian loans were down to $733 million from the $789 million in total loans as of Sept. 30, 1986, that was used in the Keefe Bruyette estimates. He added that the estimated blow to earnings was therefore probably too high. At Bankers Trust Co., a spokesman said the bank\\'s Brazilian loans now totaled $849 million -- again less than the $870 million used in the Keefe Bruyette study. A spokesman for J.P. Morgan said the estimated 10% was the highest possible impact the Brazilian suspension might have on J.P. Morgan\\'s earnings. \"It may well be lower than that,\" he said. Other banks declined to comment on the study. ',\n",
       " 'WSJ870316-0085': 'Budget Deficits Stimulate Investment</HL> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN> Lawrence Summers (editorial page, Feb. 20) argues that the huge Reagan deficits have raised consumption but, by reducing national saving, have contributed to reduced investment. Prof. Summers is right in pointing out that budget deficits do matter, and that they do contribute to more consumption. But the pie to be split is not fixed; deficits generally bring more investment as well.  Thus, real personal consumption expenditures rose by 19.5% from 1981 to 1986. But over that same period real gross private domestic investment rose by 20.9% and total fixed investment (excluding changes in business inventories) rose by 24.4%.  Indeed, if we recognize that the 1981 tax cuts and big increase in the budget deficit did not begin to be realized until the latter half of 1982, the numbers are all the more striking. Real personal consumption expenditures rose by 17.9% from 1982 to 1986, fixed investment by 37.5% and the grand total of gross private domestic investment by 47.5%.  Similar results, as shown in my recent book, \"How Real Is the Federal Deficit?\" can in fact be found over the past several decades. Larger structural budget deficits have been associated with subsequent increases in consumption and generally even larger increases in investment. The explanation is not that complicated. As long as we have considerable unemployment, which entails excess capacity in labor and capital, the increased consumption brought on by budget deficits can and does bring on increased investment as well. There is understandably greater readiness to build homes or factories or to buy new machinery that will make available more goods and services if consumers are ready to buy them.  Significant cuts in our budget deficits, whether by slashing expenditures or raising taxes, thus pose a serious danger. They will, as Prof. Summers argues, hold down consumption, but in the process they are likely to drag down investment and along with them GNP, employment and profits.  There is a solution. Reductions in fiscal stimulus brought on by moves toward budget balance can and should be accompanied by major easing of monetary policy. Consequent lower interest rates would stimulate investment and, by lowering the value of the dollar, would stimulate exports and hence reduce the extent to which our investment is financed by foreign capital. We would thus raise employment and GNP and restore the \"national saving\" about which Prof. Summers has been so concerned.  Prof. Robert Eisner Northwestern University Evanston, Ill.',\n",
